TRIALS FOR HIGH TREASON.

Derby, Sept. 23. — The Special Commission, for the trial of the Prisoners against whom true bills for High Treason had been found at the last Assize, is to be opened here on Thursday next. The greater part of the Prisoners are in the county gaol in this town. The rest, who could not be accommodated here, are in the gaol at Nottingham. They are to be marched to this town to be arraigned with the other Prisoners, and then to be sent back again till their day of trial come. The Prisoners in this town are —

Thomas Rattison, Josiah Gadber, Samuel Hunt, John Hill, Alexander Johnson, Samuel Ludlam, William Ludlam, John Moor, Josiah MacKessick, Joseph Turner, Edward Turner, Josiah Thorp, William Turner, Robert Turner, Joseph Weightman, James Wightman, George Wightman, William Wightman, Thomas Wightman, Jeremiah Brundreth (charged with having fired the fatal shot), Isaac Ludlam, Thomas Bacon, John Bacon, and the three following who have been admitted King's evidence - George Burrows, John Fletcher, and Thomas Turner: in all twenty-six Prisoners are in the County gaol upon this charge.

In Nottingham gaol are fifteen Prisoners upon the same charge, viz.: —

Edward Moore, William Adams, William Hardwicke, Jerman Buxton, Joseph Topham, Joseph Hall, Thomas Ensor, Nathaniel Jennings, Joseph Savage, John Wright, John Onion, Geo. Brassington, Isaac Ludlam, Chas. Swain, and Dan. Hunt.

The County Hall is fitted up with a temporary bench and seats for the trial. The Hall is a large building fronting towards the south. Its ordinary interior arrangement is thus:— If you suppose the floor divided into two equal parallelograms, the front one is an empty pavement, occupied during the Assizes by the crowd ; the back parallelogram is laid out in three equal parts — for the Crown Court to your right as you enter the Hall ; the *Nisi Prius* to your left ; and an inclosed place for the Grand Jury and their witnesses in the middle ; to which is attached a narrow gallery towards each Court. The unoccupied patallelogram, and the Crown Court, are now formed into one extensive and commodious Court for the ensuing trials in this manner : — The bench is at the the extemity of the pavement to the right. Immediately in front is a very large table for the accommodation of Counsel and Attorneys. A number of seats are next placed for the reception of the numerous prisoners. Two-thirds are thus occupied ; the remaining third is occupied with seats rising in regular gradation, for the convenience of spectators. To the right of the Bench is the Jury-box, and occupies the seats assigned for prisoners in the Crown Court; the remaining part, compprehending the former Bench, Bar, and Jury-box, fitted up for spectators. The Grand Jury-gallery, too, commands a full view of fhe new Bench and Bar.

Mr. Denman is engaged as Counsel for the Prisoners.

TRIALS FOR TREASON. DERBY, FRIDAY, SEPT. 20.

At eight o'clock this morning twelve prisoners came in from Nottingham, on the top of coach, all chained together. They seemed in excellent spirits, making their remarks to one another, and laughing as they passed along.

A few minutes past nine, Mr. Loundes, the Clerk of the Arraigns, took his place in Court: a short time afterwards the Attorney General entered, and seated himself on his right hand. Mr. Loundes directed that their Lordships should be informed the Attorney-General was in Court; at that instant Mr. Justice Holroyd and Mr Justice Abbott took their seats on the Bench ; Mr. Clarke took his place at the same time on the Attorney-General's right hand ; Mr. Balguy sat next.

Mr. Justice Abbott (addressing the Nottingham gaofcf)—"Gaoler, you have prisoners here ; bring them forward."

The 12 men from Nottingham were then led from a cell immediately behind the Bench to the seat prepared opposite the Jury-box. The Clerk read their names:— Isaac Ludlam the younger, Charles Swaine, John Onion, Joseph Topham, German Buxton, Edward Moore, George Brassington, William Adams, William Hardwicke, John Wright, Thomas Ensor, and Joseph Savage.

Mr. Justice Abbott (repeating the names of the prisoners)—" The Grand Jury this county having, at the last Assizes here, found true bills for high treason against you, you are indicted upon that charge, and to lake your trial on the 15th or 16th of October next. You had better be prepared for the 15th. Have you any solicitors employed for your defence ?"

Mr. Robert Bond, of Leicester, stood up at the end of the table, and said that Mr. Thomas Ragg, of Belper, in this county, and himself, were Solicitors for these and all the other Prisoners.

Mr. Justice Abbott—" Prisoners, you say these Gentlemen are your Solicitors. An order shall bemade to secure to them access to you at all reasonable hours. Have you given instructions as to any Gendemen at the Bar to be Counsel for you ?"

Mr. Bond— "These and all the other Prisoners wish for Mr. John Cross and Mr. Thomas Denman to be their Counsel."

Mr. Justice Abbott—" These Gentlemen shall be assigned by the Court for your Counsel, and an order made that they may have access to you at all reasonable hours."

The Prisoners were then withdrawn.

Mr. Justice Abbott—— After consulting with the gaoler here (Mr. Eaton), and with the physician (Dr. Fox), I find it would be neither convenient nor advisable to put these Prisoners into the gaol here. It is better, for their own sake, that they taken back again to Nottingham."

After a considerable interval, the following Prisoners were led to the bar through the Court: "Thomas Bacon (an aged man, charged to have planned the alledged insurrection,) Jeremiah Brandreth (designated the Nottingham Captain, little, thin, old man). Joseph Wightman (an uncommonly stout and good-looking young man,) William Turner (a young man, but rather disfigured by enormous black beard, apparently the growth of several months), Isaac Ludlam the elder, William Ludlam, and Samuel Hunt.

Mr. Justice Abbott addressed them in precisely the same terms he had addressed the others.

Edward Turner, Robert Turner, John McKessick, John Hill, Joseph Rawson (alias Thorp,) John Moore, William Wightman, and Thomas Wightman, were next brought up, and disposed at in like manner.

The last party were Jos. Wightman, Js. Wightman, Thos. Bettison (very young and good-looking lads), Alexander Johnson, John Bacon, and Josiah Godber (the two last rather old men.)

Joseph Turner and Samuel Ludlam were so sick that they could not brought into court; the gaoler was, therefore, instructed to communicate to them the appointment of solicitors and counsel, and the day of their trials.

Thus 35 persons altogether are to take their trials here on the 15th of October, upon a charge of high treason. All are evidently the lowest and labouring class of the community; manv ot them appeared in Court in their blue smock-frocks.

Mr. Attorney-General— " I have a motion to submit to the Court, that Mr. Henry Litchfield, the Solicitor for the prosecution, instructed to deliver to the prisoners a list the Jurors, their professions, and places of residence, at the same time with the indictment. Your Lordships may recollect a simmilar order by the Court of King's Bench at the trial of Watson."

Mr. Justice Abbott—" AN order shall be made to that effect."

The Court adjourned at half past ten, to Wednesday, the 15th of October, at twelve o'clock.

[INDICTMENT]

Our paper of this day contains an important document at this time, namely, the Bill of Indictment against the Derbyshire rioters ; of which, to save those who may not be disposed carry their attention through the dry technicalities of such an instrument, we shall subjoin as an abstract. It may here suffice to say, therefore, that the indictment contains three counts, founded upon two different statutes. The first count, which our readers will observe is for a substantive act of treason, in directly levying war against the King, is upon the long, if not far-famed statute of 25th Edw. III. The second count, which is for conspiring to depose the King, is to proved by a series overt acts five in number, and founded upon the 36th of George III. And the third count, for conspiring to levy war against the King, in order to compel him by force change his measures, made out by the same overt acts, is founded upon the same statute as the preceding. It will be observed, that the whole number rioters estimated at 500. Those who peruse the indictment itself might institute comparison between its formal language and the light narrative and rhetorical flourishes of a similar document for a similar offence in the Court of Assize at paris, contained in our paper of Friday.

THE INDICTMENT.

1st Count.—Charges that the prisoners, on divers days, between the 9th and 15th June, at the parish of South Wingfield, in the county of Derby, with a multitude false traitors, whose names are unknown, the number of 500 and more, arrayed, and armed in warlike manner, (Court), with swords, pistols, clubs, bludgeons, and other weapons, being assembled and gathered together, wickedly, maliciously, and traitorously, did levy and make war against our Lord the King within this realm, and being assembled together, arrayed and armed against our said Lord the King, did with great force and violence parade and march in hostile manner and through divers villages, places, and public highways, and maliciously and traitorously attempt and endeavour, by force and arms, to subvert and destroy the Government and Constitution of this realm by law established.

2nd Count.— Charges that the prisoners, with divers other false traitors, did compass, imagine, invent, devise, and intend to deprive and depose our said Lord the King, of and from the style, honour, and kingly name of the Imperial Crown this realm.

1st Overt Act.— Maliciously and traitorously assembling, meeting, conspiring, and consulting to devise, arrange, and mature plans and means to subvert and destroy the Constitution and Government of this realm by law established.

2nd Overt Act.— Maliciously and traitorously assembling, meeting, conspiring, consulting, and agreeing to stir up, raise, make, and levy, insurrection.rebellion, and war against our said Lord the King, within this realm; and to subvert and destroy the Constitution, &c.

3rd Overt Act.—Maliciously and traitorously purchasing, procuring, providing, and having large quantities of swords, pikes, guns, and pistols, and of gunpowder, leaden bullets, and slugs, with intent thereby to arm and array themselves and others, in order to attack, fight with, kill, and destroy the soldiers, troops, and forces of our Lord the King, and other his faithful subjects; and to raise, make, and levy insurrection, rebellion, and war against the King, and to subvert and destroy the Constitution, &c.

4th Overt Act.- Maliciously and traitorously assembling with 500 others, with swords, guns, pistols, &c. and parading and marching with great noise and violence, in, through and along divers public highways, villages, and places, and attacking and besetting the houses and habitations divers liege subjects, and seizing and taking guns, pistols, and other offensive weapons, with intent to arm themselves and others, in order attack the soldiers, to levy war, and to subvert the Constitution.

5th Overt Act.—Levying and making public war against our said Lord the King within this realm.

3d Count.—For compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, and intending to levy war against our said Lord the King within this realm, in order, by force and constraint, to compel him to change his measures and counsels.

The overt acts in this count are the same as in the second count.

The State Trials Derby still continue, and another man has been convicted —William Turner, whose trial succeeded that of Brandreth, the Nottingham Captain, has been found guilty of high treason, having been implicated in the proceedings, as second in command to Brandreth. Turner is a tall, elderly man. He appeared much dejected when in Court, and attended with an air of anxious grief to the evidence given by the witnesses, whose testimony seemed of most importance. –Brandreth was on Sunday afternoon visited by the Chaplain of the Gaol, to whose religious admonitions he was extremely attentive. His conduct, since his conviction, has been decorous and correct has a wife and three children: to his wife (who is now pregnant), he has written very proper letter, entreating her to ing up the children in the paths of religion. Brandreth professes be a Baptist.

STATE TRIALS.

In our last publication we briefly announced the termination of the proceedings against the prisoners arraigned for High Treason Derby. To publish the whole of the trials would much exceed our limits ; we shall, however, abstract some the evidence adduced against Brandreth, which will be sufficient to enable our readers to form an idea of the nature of the charges preferred against the whole of the prisoners, and the dangerous and alarming extent of their atrocities, which in the above instance was stained with the murder of an innocent individual. Jeremiah Brandreth was the first prisoner brought to the bar; and after the preliminary proceedings and the opening speech of the Attorney General, several witnesses were examined, among whom was—

Thomas Turner, who deposed, that he was apprehended consequence of the insurrection at South Wingfield, and has been in custody ever since. He lived at South Wingfield with his father, who is a frame work knitter; left his father's house on the evening of they 9th of June, and went in company with Samuel Ludlam and John Walker,to a meeting-house, close to Colonel Horton's gate; saw there William Turner, George Weightman, and a stranger, whom he afterwards found to be the Nottingham Captain, and whom he then saw at the bar. The three latter had guns, and were proceeding to Hunt's farm through a field of Col. Horton's ; on their way thither, William Turner was loading a gun with a bullet; George Weightman said, come lads, I expect engagement very soon with Jessop's men at Butterley's Works. Witness asked William Turner who the stranger was? and his answer was, "that's our Captain from Nottingham." When they got to Hunt's farm, witness and Samuel Ludlam stopped at about 100 yards from the barn. There were a score or more persons assembled. Shortly afterwards several of these persons came towards witness, and he saw that they had weapons, some pikes and guns, and one or two had swords. Prisoner, Turner, and Weightman came with the others from the barn.— Heard George Weightman say that he must go, to find whether Mr. Topham and the Pentridge people were coming to meet the party there. William Turner and prisoner formed the people into ranks, and prisoner had a bag of bullets, which he received from George Bromley. Prisoner ordered the party march. The first house which they went to was that of Mr. Hardwick. Part of the party went up to that house, but witness did not go. He went to Henry Thomlinson's, and from thence to Topham's close, where he was joined by Isaac Ludlam the elder, and Isaac Ludlam the younger, and William Ludlam, each of whom had a pike in his hand. (Some pikes were here shewn the witness, which he recognised.)— Each appeared about eight feet long, including the spike. Weightman took the bag of bullets from witness. The party proceeded to the house of Elijah Hall, Turner and prisoner commanded all the way. When they got to Hall's door they found him outside the door, which was fastened. Prisoner asked Hall for his guns, which the latter was evidently unwilling to give, but after some dispute a gun was handed out of one of the windows by Hall's desire. Prisoner got the gun, but said that he knew Hall had more arms in the house, and that they must be given up to him. Hall declared that he had no more arms, but prisoner asserted that he had, threatening that if they were not immediately given up, the door should broken open; Prisoner struck Hall upon the face, and presenting a gun at him, declared that if he (Hall) did not find out more arms, he (the prisoner) would shoot him. Witness laid hold of prisoner, telling him that he should not so ill treat Hall, who had not, he believed, any more arms in his possession. Prisoner took a candle and went up stairs to search for arms, but he found none; he, however, brought down Hall's son, who it was evident unwillingly accompanied him. Prisoner had taken him out of bed, and insisted that he must go with the party. Prisoner first demanded that the elder Hall should go with him, which the latter refused. Young Hall was however taken with the party, who next proceeded to the house of Isaac Walker, from which house they took a brass barrelled pistol, which prisoner put into an apron that he had tied round him like a belt. From Walker's they proceeded to the house of Henry Bastwick, in which a window was broken. They next went to Samuel Hunt's, where they got bread and cheese; Hunt told them to eat what they liked, stating that he would dress himself and go with them. They accordingly took bread and cheese and beer with Turner, who was a farmer. After stopping there about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, they left Hunt's house, and Hunt himself went with them. The Turners and Ludlams were armed as well as the prisoner. From Hunt's they proceeded the house of Mrs. Hepworth ; when witness reached her house he found prisoner rattling at the door, and calling for arms. The door was not opened, and prisoner called for some one to break it open. Samuel Hunt took a stone from the coping of a wall, and flung it at the door, but that did not force it open ; prisoner went from the door to a little window at the back of the house, and asked those whom he saw within to send out arms, and to open the door; those within did neither, and prisoner fired in—witness could not say whether with gun or pistol; witness on hearing the shot, went the window, and saw a man lying on the floor of the kitchen. This man witness heard was Robert Walker, the servant of Mrs. Hepworth, who was killed by the prisoner's shot. Witness told prisoner that he should not have shot the poor innocent man; and prisoner said, that it was his duty to do so, adding, that if witness said any more about it he would blow his brains out. They then proceeded to other houses. At Eastwood some of the party dropped off. Witness himself, as well as others, quitted them. Prisoner and William Turner were marching at the head of the party. Before witness left the party, he saw William Hone attempting to turn back, and prisoner seeing Hone attempt also, raised his gun (for prisoner carried a gun in his hand, as well as a pistol in his apron), threatening Hone, that he did not immediately return to the party, he would fire at him. Prisoner presented his gun at Hone, but witness and William Turner prevented him from firing. Hone did,however, return to the party; Bromley brought him back.

Mary Hepworth examined.— I am a widow and live South Wingfield Park. On the night of the 9th of June last, I had at home one son, three daughters,two men servants, and myself. About half past eleven we were disturbed by a thundering at the door and men's voices, demanding our men and arms. We got and called out they should not be opened, and that we could not part with our men or guns. We told them to go away, but they attacked the windows both sides of the house. The kitchen window at the back of the house was broken by the shutters being forced into the middle of the room, and the glasses broke out. At that time I and a daughter and my son and two men servants were in the kitchen. The servants names were R. Vaux and R. Walters. They said to my son William, we must have your guns and your men, or we will blow your brains out. Immediately after the window was broken, somebody fired in, and R. Walters was shot. He died soon after the wound was received. He had been sitting down opposite the window, putting on his boots. The shot struck him in the neck. They kept demanding the guns and the men; and I thought it was Wfliiam that was shot, and said the guns must be delivered, or we shall be murdered. The guns that were concealed in the cellar, were then fetched, and delivered to them out of the window. Then they said, we must have your men. I went up stairs and told them out of the window, that they could not have any men, as one was shot; and they said that they would serve me the same, if I did not open the door. They, however, went away then. On examining outside, I found several stones and a pike, with which the door seemed have been bored.

G. Goodwin examined by Mr. Gurney.— I am one of the Managers of Butterley Iron Works. Before Monday the 8th of June, we had many of our men sworn special constables, for the purpose of suppressing the insurrection that was expected every day. The neighbourhood was in a very disturbed state. On the night in question we had assembled our men, to the amount of nearly 100, and kept them together all night at Ripley. In the course of the night we heard shots fired, horns blowing, and shouts in the neighbouring villages. We were apprehensive of our works being attacked. When daylight came we dispersed, supposing the insurrection would not take place. Soon after, on looking down the road from Pentridge to Butterley, we saw about 100 men approaching us. They were drawn up in a regular line. They were armed with guns, pikes, and spears, and a very few had no arms. Upon this orders were given for the men to retire into the office of the iron-works to defend it. They had the prisoner at the head as Captain. When they got to the foundery gates, the prisoner ordered them to halt! to the right face, front! He had a gun in his hand, and a pistol stuck in kind of belt, like an apron, twisted round him. The men then extended in a curved line opposite us. We were inclosed by them. The prisoner knocked at the gates with the butt of his gun. I was in front, and said, What do you want —what is your object here ? He said, we want your men. I said, you shall not have one of them—you are too many already— unless you are going for a better purpose, disperse; depend on it the laws will be too strong for you— you are going with halters round your necks, and you will all be hanged. The prisoner made no reply. I then observed I. Ludlam, armed with a pike, and J. Taylor armed with a gun. I accosted I. Ludlam, and said, Good God, Isaac, what are you about on such an errand as this ? you have got a halter about your neck go home. I took him by the shoulder, and strove to push him into the office; but he seemed much agitated, said, I am as bad as I can be, and I must go on.— He might have been sheltered in our office, but would not. S. Booth's servant and two others took advantage of my offer, came in, and we protected them. Some time afterwards I saw W. Weightman on horseback, going towards Nottingham, but not the way the others went. I seized the horse's bridle, and accused him of going to join the rebels. At last he owned he was, and said, if would let him go, he would go home ; but as I saw a bag under him, I seized the horse's head again, and said, you rascal, I wiil have that bag ; it contains bullets, and you are taking them to the rebels. I pulled him off his horse, and he said he would give them quietly. There were in the bag bullets, also a stocking full, apparently of a different bore.

At nine o'clock on Saturday, their Lordships having taken their seats on the Bench, T. Bacon, Bacon, S. Hunt, J. Turner, E. Turner. J. Mackessick, German Buxton, and J. Godber, were put to the bar.— Mr. Denman then humbly moved their Lordships that, these prisoners might be allowed to withdraw their plea of not Guilty, and plead Guilty. The Attorney General assented to the proposition. After these prisoners were conducted from the bar, J.Moone, E. Moone, C Swaine, J. Hill, J. Rawson G. Brassington, W. Handwicke, W. Weightman. A. Johnson, and T. Bettison, were placed the bar. Mr, Denman made similar motion with respect to these, which was similarly disposed of. I. Ludlam jun. S. Ludlam, W. Ludlam, R. Turner, J. Weightman,jun. T. Weightman, W. Adams, J. Wright, T. Topham, T T. Lensor, and J. Savage were next put to the bar. A Jury was then called, and went into the box. Mr. Lowndes read over an abstract of the indictment to them, and the Attorney General then rose and spoke as follows .

"Gentlemen, —It will be some relief to your minds on the present occasion, for me to tell you in the outset of what I address to you, that no evidence will be offered against the persons at the bar. It has been most truly said by a most able writer on the Criminal Law, that one of the ends and final causes of human punishment is to deter others by example from the commission of similar crimes. I think I state the very words of Mr. Justice Blackstone, for no words of my own could adequately express the opinion of so great and elegant a writer. When many persons have committed a crime of a public nature, it is absolutely necessary to bring some, and often many, to the bar of public justice ; but when that time arrives, when we suppose and hope there have been sufficient examples made, nothing is so gratifying to sheath the sword of Justice, and hold out the shield of mercy. You observe, Gentlemen, among the persons at the bar, many of them are very young. From what has appeared in evidence, and from the names of many of them, we have ascertained that they are connected by the ties of relationship to others who have been most deeply implicated in this business. Some are the nephews, and some the children of those who have been the most active. I am willing to suppose, that without that due consideration which they ought to have paid, they have been induced to follow the bad example of others; and I hope that they will look up to this day as an example in future. It is for that example that I have brought them before you, and not for the purpose of offering evidence against them; hoping and trusting, that so far from the course having any improper effect, it may restore them back in quietness the bosoms of their families, who have had for them an affection and regard; and that being so restored, they may profit by the example which this proceeding affords them ; and looking at the dangerous and frightful situation in which they have so recently been, they will become honest, sober, industrious, and religious men and that they may by that honesty and integrity, fill with propriety the stations of life to which it has pleased God to call them. If hereafter I should hear that they have done that—that they have become valuable members of society, and that (should it please God to prolong their lives) they advance, and go on a good example to others—if I hear that, say, it will afford me the greatest possible gratification that I could receive. Throughout these proceedings, Gentlemen, I have endeavoured to perform my duty, as well as my poor talents would allow me, and I trust with justice to all. I hope, and am willing to believe, that the step I am at present taking, will have the good effect I wish ; perhaps I may be supposed to be in error ; but it is the result of my most serious deliberation."

Lord Chief Baron. " Gentlemen, his Majesty's Attorney-General having declined offering any evidence against the unfortunate prisoners at the bar, your duty is only to find them not guilty."

The foreman pronounced a verdict according to tbe direction of the Learned Judge, who addressed the prisoners in a most impressive manner. Mr. Denman now rose, evidently much affected, and in a few words expressed his hope with respect to tbe young men at bar, in coincidence with the sentiments the Attorney-General. So surprised were these unfortunate men, that they stood motionless the bar for short time, and were much affected.— Those prisoners who had pleaded guilty were now conducted into Court. After them came Brandreth, Isaac Ludlam the elder, William Turner, and George Weightman, whose appearance was announced by the clanking of the irons, which echoed through the silent Hall in a horrid manner. All of them begged for mercy on being asked what they had to say why judgment to die according to law should not be passed. Tbe Chief Baron then addressed them:

" Prisoners at the bar, —In the unhappy situation in which you now stand, it becomes my duty to pass upon you the sentence of the law, which you have incurred by the violation of the laws of your country. It must be some consolation to you, however, that you have had every assistance and every advantage, that men in your situation could have. You have been defended by Counsel of your own selection, who, without any interruption from any quarter, used every exertion your favour which their experience, their learning, and their great abilities suggested to them. I am speaking of those among you who pleaded not guilty. You were tried by several Juries, whose respectability was undoubted. During the whole of the investigation on this most important and solemn occasion, every attention has been paid to every side of the question, and yet those juries found themselves compelled, by the most irresistible evidence, to find you guilty of High Treason. Those of you who were not tried by Jury desired have the liberty of withdrawing your pleas. You knew that your cases had been decided by the verdicts which had been given. You are, therefore, all of you, before the world, guilty of High Treason— the highest offence known to our laws. Your insurrection, thank God, did not last long, but whilst it continued it was marked with violence, and with the murder of an innocent young man, who did not offer the least provocation. Your object was to wade through the blood of your countrymen ; to extinguish the Law and Constitution of the country ; and to substitute for the liberty of your fellow subjects, anarchy and ruin. Thank God your purpose failed. It is not my intention to dwell on this dreadful picture, but I hope may be allowed to express my sincere hopes and sincere wishes, that the example which you will furnish this important day, may deter others from yielding to the wild and frantic delusions of rapacious spirits, and warn others, if such others there be, from being made instruments in the hands of hellish agitators. Let me beseech you to weigh well your condition ; your lives have become forfeited to the violated laws of your country. Make the most of the small portion of that life which is left, and endeavour to make some compensation to society by repentance. I cannot trust myself say more, [Here his Lordship was deeply affected,] but must pass upon you the awful sentence of the law, which is, that you, and each of you, be taken hence to the gaol, whence you came, from whence you must be drawn a hurdle to the place of execution, and be there severally hanged by the neck until you are dead ; your head must then be severed from your bodies, which are to be divided into four quarters, and to be at his Majesty's disposal."

The greater part the unhappy men seemed deeply affected by tbe solemn address ; but Brandreth remained unmoved. The prisoners were then conveyed back to gaol, followed immense concourse of people. Thirty-five persons had been originally brought for trial for this crime. Of these twelve were discharged on Saturday, the Attorney-General having declined to prosecute, and the Jury having in consequence found them not guilty. Of the 23, four were tried at length, and convicted. The remaining nineteen withdrew their plea of not guilty, and pleaded guilty. The four convicts are confined in the condemned cells, and walk by themselves in the adjoining yard. They are heavily ironed. Brandreth continues to cherish his beard. He wears the same dress, and looks exactly the same as during bis trial— he walks with a very firm pace, and has much intrepidity in his air and manner.— Turner, in his look, gait, and general appearance, is the very picture of absolute despondency; never did a human eye more strikingly express "helpless, hopeless, brokenness heart."— Ludlam has a singular appearance of melancholy composure, the obvious result of deep distress, supported and tempered resolution and reflection — Weightman has no mark of despondency about him . it is remarkable that never associates with the other three, but while they are walking together drives backwards and forwards by himself. It may be worthy of notice, too, that Turner, Ludlam, and Weightman, have their work clothes, and not the dress they wore during the trial. The other nineteen prisoners are not ironed, and they have the free use ot tbe common yard.

EXECUTION OF BRANDRETH, TURNER AND LUDLAM FOR HIGH TREASON

Derby, Friday Nov. 7. Before we detail the circumstances that attended the last awful scene of the distressing drama which ignorance, delusion, and discontent, have lately exhinited in this place, we beg leave to mention a few particulars of the conduct of the wretched victims of the law on the day preceding the execution.

It will be recollected, that Brandreth latterly spoke less favourably of his trial than he had done at first. He was heard occasionally to mutter, "Oliver has brought me to this." "But for Oliver I should not should not have been here." On Thursday morning, the Rev. Mr. Pickering said to him, that it was well known where Oliver was for several days before the insurrection, and that it could proved was not with him. He made no reply. He was then asked, how he came engage in such enterprize. He said, he would answer no questions of that kind, and begged that might not troubled with any. The Clergyman asked him if he felt no dread of the death that was now so near; he replied coolly, "I feel dread." He afterwards prayed in the hearing of the Clergyman, who remarked to him, that he had expressed contrition for the murder he had committed. said, he felt no contrition on that subject. Thus he continued, ready to join in any act of religion, insensible of any remorse, and proof against all fear. At half-past three in the afternoon he took his usual walk. It rained pretty heavily, and his heels were seen bare through his worn-out stockings; yet he walked backwards and forwards as both his mind and his body were perfectly at ease. At the same time, his features and looks had no symptom of insensibility. G. Weightman was labouring slowly and heavily along, with his massy ohains clinking at his heels; the reprieved prisoners were singing hymns in the adjoining rooms. Brandreth was quite regardless of all.

Turner and Ludlam declined again to move out of their cell. Ludlam's sons, his brothers, and his sister, saw him for the last time. They prayed together with an earnestness and a fervour that were quite overpowering. They were all dreadfully agitated at parting. Yet Ludlam shortly afterwards said had feared it would have been worse. Turner's brother saw him again this day (Thursday), and their final parting was deeply affecting. Both Turner and Ludlam were extremely penitent. They protested they never should have moved in the unfortunate affair but for Bacon and Brandreth. They blamed Thomas Bacon more particularly, and said they considered him the author of all the mischief. Turner had been with Brandreth on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of June. They both continued to express much anxiety that should become penitent and sorrowful for his cruelties and bloodshed. Ludlam expressed strong wish that the People would hereafter be submissive and obedient to the King and the Laws.

This morning Ludlam and Turner looked shockingly wan and spiritless. They had watched the whole night in prayer and psalm-singing. At nine the Chaplain visited them, and assisted them in their devotions. They afterwards continued to pray aloud till the moment of immediate preparation arrived. Their expressions were always the same:– "O Lord, have mercy!" "O Lord, save my soul!"— "If I am on a bad foundation, upon a sandy foundation, Lord, take it now away, and set me upon the rock."—"O pardon all my sins for the sake thy Son, who died once for all mankind.!" –"O Lord, come now with thy strength, and support my soul."— While the one fervently uttered these expressions, the other kept answering "Amen." Then the other took up the prayer, and was accompanied in the same manner by his companion. Their voices were dejected in the extreme.

Brandreth slept as usual, rose in good spirits, and showed no sign despondency or fear.

From an early hour in the morning the scaffolding and drop were erecting in front of the gaol; and a considerable number of persons were collected in the street, quietly looking on, and listening with visible alarm to each sad note of preparation.

At half-past 11 all the prisoners, excepting the three men to be executed, and George Weightman, left the Chapel. All held their handkerchiefs to eyes, and sobbed deeply. Shortly after they had come into the yard, W. Turner's brother, Edward, shrieked horribly, and was carried into a room by two men. The Chaplain then administered the sacrament to the four convicts.

At 12 precisely, Mr. Simpson, the Uuder-Sheriff, appeared with a few javelin men, and a considerable number of special constables. The prisoners then descended from the Chapel to the room which Brandreth and Weightman had occupied. Here their irons were knocked off. Turner and Ludlam kept praying all the while. When Ludlam's chains were knocking off, he exclaimed— "O Lord Jesus ! thou art tender-hearted ! O be now my portion !"

At a quarter-past 12 the hurdle was drawn up at the door of this room. It was a very simple machine, farmed of a few boards nailed upon two long beams.— Brandreth came out first, and, while placing himself on the hurdle, said— "Some one hold me, lest I fall off." A man held him while the horse was driven slowly round the yard. He nodded the several prisoners as he passed along.

William Turner was next drawn on the hurdle. When he came close by the other prisoners they all screamed and wept most bitterly. When Isaac Ludlam was placed on the hurdle, he clasped his hands, and raised a fervent look towards Heaven. The prisoners cried out still more bitterly. Turner and Ludlam kept their eyes shut while on the hurdle. Brandreth and Turner were kept in a narrow passage of the gaol till Ludlam joined them. He, seeing them stand there, asked if he might not walk there for a little. Turning to the Chaplain, he said, "You remember what I mentioned to you," (we believe something relating his family). They then proceeded immediately in the same order to the scaffold. Brandreth looked coolly around upon the immense multitude of spectators; and in a loud and firm voice said, "God be with you all." He stood resolute and silent while the executioner adjusted the rope round his neck.

Turner came out next, and advanced with unusual firmness of step. While the executioner was putting the rope round his neck, he exclaimed loudly and distinctly, "This is all Oliver and the Government." The Chaplain at this moment came in front those two, and prevented any further observations.

Isaac Ludlam came out last; and when the rope was applied to his neck, devoutly said, "I receive this at the hand of the Lord :" then raising his voice to louder pitch, he prayed thus;— "O, may my soul now tower up to glory.  O, may I now go where Angels and Saints worship thee. May I meet this great concourse of people Heaven. O Lord, I pray for high and low, and poor, and free. May this awful dispensation of thy providence be sanctified."— Here the Chaplain's voice in prayer having become louder than Ludlam's, Ludlam ceased to use any expressions of his own, and joined the Chaplain repeating, "Amen" to every particular Petition.

They all repeated the Lord's Prayer very distinctly, and immediately afterwards the drop fell.

Brandreth appeared perfectly composed during the whole time. He held a black silk handkerebief (the same which be had worn at the trial, and which had just been taken from his neck) in his clasped hands while at their last devotions. This he held in exactly the same manner after life forsook his frame. He dropped quite still, and seemed dead at once. His beard, which remained untouched, looked very frightful from underneath the white cap that was over his face. Turner, too, seemed sufficiently firm in his last moments, and died quietly. Ludlam, while praying, immediately before the drop fell, was visibly agitated, and seemed to die with much pain; for be was repeatedly convulsed after he had been thrown off.

The drop fell a quarter before one, and at a quarter past one they were cut down. Their coffins were piled upon the scaffold. The block, a long piece of timber, supported at each end pieces of a foot high, and having a small cog laid across the upper end of it, on which the neck of the body was to be placed, was fixed at the other extremity of the scaffold. Two axes and two knives, with black handles, were at the same time exhibited. Some saw-dust was then strewed on the scaffold. The crowd, considerably more than 6000 persons, kept together all this time. Brandreth's body was then laid upon the block, with the face downwards, and the head towards the street, in the full view of the people; the scaffold not being more than ten feet from the ground. The executioner raised the axe and struck at the neck with all his force. At that instant there was a burst of horror front the crowd. The executioner then took up the head, and holding it by the hair, addressed the people, "Behold the head of Jeremiah Brandreth the traitor !" Hitherto the multitude had been quiet and motionless. The instant the head waa exhibited, there was a tremendous shriek set up; and they ran violently in all directions, as if under the impulse of sudden phrenzy. Those that resumed their stations groaned and hooted. The javelin-men and Constables were all in-motion ; and few dragoons, who had been stationed at both ends of the street, drew nearer with drawn swords. But all became immediately calm. Very few of the immense multitude now remained, and these looked quietly on while the heads of Turner and Ludlam were successively exhibited in the same way. The heads and bodies were then put into the coffins, and all spectators dispersed.

The caravan of the prison, in which the prisoners were wont to conveyed the County Hall for trial, was now drawn up, and the three coffins, on each which was written in chalk the name of its inmate, were placed in it, and driven off to St. Werburgh's Churchyard, where one deep grave had been prepared for the reception of the whole. The Javelin-men and Under-Sheriff followed, and forming a line round the exterior wall of the burial-ground, the coffins were carried in, lowered into the grave, and covered with earth, without any further ceremony. The Javelin-men then returned to their several homes. Nothing further worthy remark occurred. During those hours in which Brandreth was not employed in prayer, he occupied himself in knitting a work-bag for his wife, upon the surface of which contrived to form, with different coloured cottons, various ornaments. This he mentioned, in a letter written just before his execution, as his last relic. He also left behind him, with disentions that it should be transmitted to his wife, the list of witnesses with which he had been furnished previous to his trial, on the blank sides of the leaves of which he had written, in a fair hand, a letter to his sister, and that to his wife, which we have mentioned. These letters breathed nothing but the spirit of the purest religion, and made no allusion whatever to the cause his death, or to the outrages in which be had been engaged. Indeed, both to the Rev. Mr. Pickering, and every other person who touched on these subjects, he said they were matters between God and himself, with which no human being had any thing to do. There were also written in the same book several forms of prayer of his own composition; all shewing his perfect acquaintance with the Christian religion, and his sincere belief in all its doctrines.

We have already so frequently mentioned the unusual firmness of his mind, that it is almost unnecessary to add new facts to prove it more fully, except that such occasion every little minute detail becomes interesting. While his irons were knocking off, preparatory to his going out for execution, be called for his pipe— it was brought to him lighted, and he smoaked with great coolness while the same operation was performing on his companions. He then resigned it.

Those with whom he shook hands, stated that be was extremely warm, and his face was covered with perspiration. When found by W. Turner in the little passage of the prison, and waiting for Ludlam, who had yet to be drawn upon the hurdle, he seized him vehemently by the hand, and exclaimed— "Never mind, my dear fellow, we shall shortly be in Heaven, with the Father of all, where all trouble will be at an end." —Wm. Turner grasped the hand of Brandreth, and said he hoped so. Mr. Pickering now asked Turner if he felt more resigned to his fate; he answered, that he had prayed all night for fortitude, and believed he should suffer without fear. He was then asked how he felt as to his consciousness a future state ? To which he answered, he had prayed that subject, but had no answer. His tones were firm, but he was the image of death, and certainly did not die with that true religious feeling or charity in his heart by which Ludlam and Brandreth were distinguished. He was cold as ice when he mounted the scaffold.

All the Papers left the prisoners were given to Mr. Lockett, who, after taking Copies, directed that they should be duly forwarded. Among other Papers found in Brandreth's bag, was a Letter sent from London, inclosing him a 1l. note, exhorting him to die with manly firmness, but not with fool-hardiness. His writing on the blank pages of the list of witnesses who wore subpoenaed on his trial, as mentioned above, led to a belief that he was writing the history of his life ; but this turns out not to have been the case. His writings consist of prayers his own composition, written with great energy— a Letter to a sister and brother, pretty much in the same strain with that first sent to his wife and, lastly, on the very last page, the following Letter to his Wife, which he wrote on Friday morning previous to his receiving the sacrament:

"My beloved Wife— This is the morning before I suffer. I have sat down to write my last lines to you, hoping that my soul will shortly be at rest in Heaven, through the redeeming blood Christ. I feel no fear in passing through the shadow of death to eternal life; so hope you will make the promise I have, to your own soul, as we may meet in Heaven, where every sorrow will cease, and all joy and peace. My beloved, I received a letter this morning with a 1l. note in it, which I leave for you in the gaoler's hands, with the other things, which will be sent to you, as I shall mention before I have done. This is the account of what I said to you: one work bag, two balls of worsted and one of cotton, and a handkerchief, an old pair of stockings and shirt, and the letter I received from beloved sister, with the following sum of money: 1l. 12s. 7d. This, suppose, will be seat in a packet to you by some means. My dearly beloved wife, this is the last correspondence I can have with you, so you will make yourself as easy as you possibly can, and I hope God will bless and comfort you, as he has me; so my blessing attend you and the children, and the blessing of God be with you all now and evermore. Adieu ; adieu all for ever. Your most affectionate husband, "J. Brandreth."

The letter to which he refers, and which came from London enclosed to Mr. Eaton, is as follows : 

"JEREMIAH BRANDRETH. —I cannot help feeling pity as I really believe from what I read of you in the newspapers that you possess the materials to make a good man'; but unfortunately, from some cause or other, they have been perverted to a most shocking purpose. I therefore request you accept trifle towards carrying into effect the charitable and kind intention I bear you have expressed provide for your wife and children before you die ; trusting that you will continue to conduct yourself as a man whose whole strength and consolation is in Christ. Use boldness, which hath in it more the fool than the wise man ; but keep a calm and dignified silence much ever you can.

(Signed) "A Total Stranger."  
"Wednesday, Nov. 5, I817."

It appears that Brandreth has several relations living in the neighbourhood of Nottingham.

"ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE, TRIAL & BEHAVIOUR OF Jeremiah Brandreth, William Turner & Isaac Ludlam, Who were executed on the New Drop, in front of the County Gaol, Derby, on Friday November 7th 1817 FOR HIGH TREASON."

//via https://www.genealogy-links.co.uk/html/life.trial.behaviour.html

JEREMIAH BRANDRETH, Alias John Coke, alias the Nottingham captain, WILLIAM TURNER, ISAAC LUDLAM, the elder, and a number of other were brought to trial at the County Hall, in Derby, on Thursday the 16th October 1817.

It appeared on evidence that a number of persons, from one to five hundred, assembled in the Parish of Southwingfield, in the county of Derby, and with guns, pistols, swords, clubs, pikes, bludgeons and other offensive weapons, maliciously and traitorously did levy and make war against our Lord the King, and his laws; and after their trials, which lasted several days, were found GUILTY of HIGH TREASON, and the following sentence passed on them.

That you and each of you be taken to the jail from which you have been brought, and thence drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, where you shall be severally hanged by the neck till you be dead, and afterwards your heads be severed from your bodies, and your bodies be divided into four quarters, and placed at his Majesty' disposal; and may the Lord God of all mercy have compassion upon you.

JEREMIAH BRANDRETH, aged 27, Framework Knitter, was born in Exeter; he has left a wife and two children, who now reside at Sutton-in-Ashfield, in the County of Nottingham. A short time before his execution Brandreth's wife visited him in prison, and asked him some particulars as to his hooting Mrs. Hepworth's man, but he declined giving her any information on the subject: and being asked the reason why he had not been shaved during his imprisonment, she replied, "It was not to disguise himself, but that it appeared to him more natural in that state." He was not much affected at seeing her, and she was less distressed than might have been expected.

When Brandreth was asked by the Clerk of Arraigns, what he had to say, why sentence to die should not be passed upon him, according to law, he replied, "I would ask for mercy, if it were possible, that mercy could be extended towards me, and would address you in the words of out Saviour  If it be possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not of my will, but the will of the Lord be done."

WILLIAM TURNER, aged 46, Stone Mason, was a tall man, and had been a soldier, was born at Southwingfield, in this county, and a single man. Several persons gave Turner a good character, who said they had known him for many years, and always considered him a loyal and humane man till this happened.

On Wednesday Turner took a final leave of his brothers and relations. He was at once visited by eleven persons, who left him calm but were themselves in the greatest possible affliction.

ISAAC LUDLAM, aged 52, Stone Mason, was born at Southwingfield, in this county, has left a wife and seven children to lament his untimely end. A short time before his execution he wrote an affectionate letter to his wife, in which he recommends her to live in the fear of God, and to bring up their children in the ways of religion, which will always prove ways of pleasantness, and the end will be everlasting life  It having been asserted in some of the public papers that he was a dissenting Teacher, and in others that he was a Methodist Preacher; we have good authority for stating that he never was a Methodist Preacher, nor did he ever hold any office in that body.

One Tuesday Isaac Ludlam received a visit from his wife and daughter. Mrs Ludlam is a very respectable looking woman. Her distress on account of the situation of her husband was great in the extreme. His doom seemed death to her. Words cannot adequately describe the mournfully affecting interview. The parting moments when the husband and father gazed on the wife and child for the last time was terrible. Burning tears mingled with fond embraces, were often repeated, and the mother and the daughter left the prison in all the horrors of despair.

Since condemnation they have been regularly attended by the Rev. J. Pickering, Chaplain of the Gaol, and have for the last few days conducted themselves in a manner becoming their awful situation.  This was the first execution for "a levying of war against the King," that ever took place in Derby. We trust in God that it will also be the last.

On the morning of execution the prisoners partook of the Lord's Supper, and joined the Chaplain in fervent prayer and we hope that their prayers were heard.

About twelve o'clock the unhappy sufferers were brought out in front of the County Gaol, and after a short time spent in prayer, were launched into eternity, in the presence of a vast concourse of spectators, and after hanging the usual time, their bodies were taken down and their heads cut off and held up for public view, while the executioner exclaimed, "Behold the Head of the Traitor."

The untimely end of these unhappy men is an awful warning of the sad effects of walking in the way of transgressors, and of the bitter consequences of neglecting serious religion. Ludlam once in his life for a short time was connected with a religious body, but fell from his profession. Brandreth nine years ago had some religious impressions, though he unhappily suffered them to die away; but he never connected himself with any body of professing Christians. Had they in sincerity followed religion, they would have they would have found among either the serious dissenters or the Methodists, those who would have been their helpers in the way to heaven, and they might now have been loyal subjects and useful and respected Christians
