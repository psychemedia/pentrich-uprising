Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14 March 1812

The depredations of the Machine-breakers, in the West-Riding of this county, we are sorry to find are still continu-d. The following is a copy of a letter from our Correspondent at Hudderstfield, dated March 12:—

"In the last week, (I think on Thursday night) four houses, near Slaithwaite, were entered by theLuddires, and the frames, shears, &c. destroyed. The name of the owners I have not on the subjecxt*. Threatening letters have heen sent, of which you will soon learn the particulars.

" Last night, the houses of Mr. John Garner, of Honley ; Mr. Clement Dyson, Dungeon, and Mr. Roberts, Crosland; were visit by the malcontents, and the obnoxious nachinery deatroyed. More troops are at this moment entering the town."

"Nottingham, March 9.—" Such is the apparent disposition, and systematic conduct of the frame breakers that, if a frame is once marked out for and destruction, its state may be said to be settled, except some step be taken by its possessor to remove the cause assigned for its condemnation ; at least such are the conclusions we have a right to draw from what we daily sea and hear. It has long formed a topic of conversation, that Mr. B. Topham, of Pentridge, in Derbyshire, had excited the hatred of the *Luddites*, by his activity in attempting to bring some of them to justice, in consequence of several frames being broken in his shop some time ago; and, on Saturday night last, his property became an oiject of their vengeance; for a party of men entered his dwelling and demolished seven pointnet lace, and three plain hose frames. I am likewise infornmed, that a man and his wife, who are the chief evidence against a person of the name of *Elliot*, now confined in Derby Gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, likewise felt the effects of their fury; and only escaped with their lives on condition of promising not to swear against the man."

YORKSHIRE LENT ASSIZES

...

Mr. Justice Le BLANC addressed the Grand Jury in nearly the following terms:—

"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY,  
" Assembled as we are at present in theordinary discharge of a duty you have so often been called upon to perform; I should have felt it unnecessary to trouble you with any observations if a case had not occurred which seemed from its infrequency to require some notice. The list of offences, though somewhat longer than usual, does not appear to contain many cases of novelty, and I hoped to have had the pleasure of congratulating the County of York in having escaped the contagion of that system of depredation which has continued so long and occasioned such extensive mischief in a neighbooring county, but this hope has not been fully realised ; I am grieved to find from a case in the Calendar, and from information received since we arrived here, that this county has not entirely escaped the invfluence of bad example ; but I trust there will be found not only sufficient vigilance in the magisiracy to suppress these disorders; but, also courage in the subjects, to protect their property from the attacks of these depredators. The advantages of machinery in manufacture has been so clearly proved, and the subject so ably discussed, that it excites surprize that any should be found so ignorant and infatuated as to imagine that the destruction of machinery should better the situation of the persons employed in manufactures. These absurd ideas have been refuted over and over again, not only by writers on the subject, but by the Judges in their different circuits, that one might have expected none could be found ignorant enough to be influenced by them, and I should have hoped no man would have been as wicked as to instil such mischievous notions into the minds of these deluded men. The Legislature has heretofore provided penalties and serious penalties for the protection of this species of property ; all that is required is that the law should be put in force, which can only be by vigilance and courage in detecting offenders. I only find one case in the Calendar which has any refer to this subject, and that person, most fortunately for himself, was by the prompt exertions of a Magistrate arrested, perhaps before he had completed the offence. He will probably be prosecuted under some of the provisions of what is called the Black Act, an Act passed to repress certain enormities in the reigl if George I. committed by persons armed and disguised by blacking their faces, and as prosecutions under this act are extremely rare, I take the liberty of pointing out to you the words of the Act, ' If any person or persons being armed witb swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, and having his or their faces blacked, or being otherwjse disguised, shall appearin any forest, park, &c. *or in any high road*, and shall be convicted thereof, they shall be adjudged guilty , of felony.

" Two circumstances it will be observed are neceasary to constitute this offence, that the person should be armed, and should be disguised by having his face blacked, and in the present instance perhaps it will appear, but of this you will judge when the case comes before you, that this person was discovered before the offence was completed, and that only one of these circumstances can be proved against him ; he was evidently on the verge of committing a capital felony, from which he was, perhaps fortunately for himself, witheld by being taken into custody. You will therefore inquire not only as to his person being disguised, but as to the fact of his being armed witb offensive weapons, as swords, fire-arms, or other weapons, calculated to injure or terrify his Majesty's subjects. I have presumed to make these observations because a case of this kind may not have come before you, and in a statute so extremely penal there ought to be satisfactory grounds for putting a person upon his trial before another Jury, who in such case will have ultimately to decide upon his guilt or innocence.

... "

The Bill against James Shaw, of Leeds, clothdresser, charging him with having disfigured his person by blacking his face, and with being unlawfully armed with offensive weapons, was thrown out, by the Grand Jury, on Wednesday; and he was, of course, discharged without being put upon hist trial.

Monday, February 2. NOTTINGHAM FRAME BREAKING PREVENTION BILL


...

Lord *Grosvenor* proposed an amendment, the object of which, we understood to be, that the attempt to destroy should not be declared a felony, but a misdemeanor.— Agreed to.

The clause requiring the occupier of any frame which might be destroyed, to give information to the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, was objected by Lord Grenville, on the grounds of excessive hardship of compelling individuals to leave their homes and families under whatever circumstances, for the purpose of giving the information required. His Lordship therefore moved the insertion of the qualifying words,— "unless such individual shall assign reasonable cause for not having given the information required.Æ Acceded to.

The House then resumed, and the Report was ordered to be brought up to-morrow.— Adjourned.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 01 February 1812

RIOTS IN NOTTINGHIAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE. *(From the Review of Friday last.)* In recording the depredations of the frame-breakers, we have been led to hope each succeeding week would terminate these ever-to be-1amented transactions. In this, however, we have been mistaken ; for each succeeding week has hitherto been accompanied by succeeding crimes, and our present records present a scene not less lamentable than the one given in our last; and prove that neither the vigilance of police officers, the terror of the military, nor even the impending penalties of the law, are sufficient to suppress this spirit of revolt. It is with pleasure we state that one reputable house in this town (Wm. Nunn and Co.) have publicly announced that they have taken off all the frame rent, and are giving the full prices. This conduct, if followed by other manufacturers, will, we trust, soon restore peace and harmony in the town and neighbourhood.

TO DO

On Saturday night one frame was broken in this town ; and the following evening four were destroyed at New Radford, one of which was supposed to be the completest silk frame in existence; and, we understand, was then employed in makting an order of stockings for the Prince Regent. On this case we are desired by the holder of these frames to state that he had worked in the finest of these frames for twenty years ; during which time he has ccontinued to receive the same price, and marked the stockings with the proper marks. On the same night two or three frames were broken at Ruddington, nine of the warp lace kind at Limby, all of great valie, and all esnployed in making the two.course-hole net. -At the last mentioned place the people had an expectation that a visit would be paid thetil, and a number-had agreed to syatch for-the approacitofstheic nocturhal sisitors1 witich. they did ttlU miADgItlf, Wt Wbitch ttme,; imagingn.1 all the danger was over, they dispersed, and went to their respective homes. This was no sooner done, than the framerbreakers made their appear. ance: fourteen of theem entered. the house of Mr. Shipley, and in ten minutes completed their work. Tfie damage is estimated at 2001. and upwards. On the same night, seven plaim cotton frames at Cotmanblay, in the parish of likiston; and, if our information be correct, eleven of the latter de- scription were destroyed at Swanwick: the two latter towns are in Derbyshire. At ten o'clock this moriming wve received the dis- agreeable intelligeuce, that 22 frames were last night broken at Lentin. About 50 men entered time village, armed in various ways ; and while the mischief was going on, every pass in the village was guarded. One man, who was passiug with a loaf of bread, was stopped by them, and compelled to stand sentry. himself, with a bar of iron in his hand, with an order to give the alarm if any one approached, or otherwise to have his brains blown o01t. The 1oan Who ?? to Nottingham to inform the soldiers, had a narrow escape ; one of tbe frame-breakers ?? after hin,, vociferating the most horrid vengeasice if he caught him. The inan escaped, and so did the depredators. The names of the persons at whosc houses the frames are hro- ken, with ?? imummiber at each hIomise, are at fol. aow :-Fiye at G. Ball's, four of which, he has ii,- formed us, were his owtu property, and were work- ing at full price ; eight at Thos. Selby's ?? uie at Wim. Selby's, and pulled tbe jack-wires out uf ano- timer two ?? Shepherd's ; one at-' Tay- lor's one at John Barnes's; one at Amn dTaylor's; amid two at Wm. Burton't. After they hiid done, they fired three pistols. What .mdds to tie auda- city of this affair is, that Lentom, is noly about a quarter of a mile from the barrack-, and one from Nottingham. Murders in TatcbL1 Ifighvary.-Mr. Cra- ham went to the unfiortunate Mr. Marr's pre- mises on Thursday, and ex-amined some witnesses on the spot. 'l'he prisoners Hart and Ablbass are still kept in close confiumement. not being able to account fur about a quarter oif all hour of their time on the night of the murder at Mr. William. son's. It has been ascertained, that a maim can walk at a quick pare iii less thai, five rmilmtites frnm Mr. Willianismil's to thie li'ar-tree public-huose.

Topham - death notice
https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0004591/18320211/078/0008
Nottingham and Newark Mercury - Saturday 11 February 1832

On Thursday week, at Pentridge, of which place he was a native, Mr. Benjamin Topham, aged 67. He some years arm resided in Nottingham, where he was well known. His polities were liberal; yet at the Derbyshire, or Jerry Brandreth *revolution*, in June 1817, all Topham's frames were broken. The disturbances broke out at Pentridge, where Topham was then living. He was an upright, industrious man, but he laid the breaking of his frames so much to heart, that he lost his energy of spirit, and almost sank under it.

[Frames also broken in December 1811 and March 1812]

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS. The Nottingham Papers state, that the Commission of Assize had been opened in the Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bayley, after complimenting the Magistrates on the smallness of the Calendar, observed, that in the two cases of frame-breaking, " that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital." No outrage had been committed by the frame-breakers within the last few days. The ten frames broken yesterday se'nnight, at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, belonging to Mr. Topham, were in full work. The violence appears to have been owing to personal spleen, as the silk and lace pieces about the frames were much injured, his doors and windows all broken to pieces, and his own life menaced, while the violence was committing, by a number of armed men without. Mr. Topham for a short time concealed himself in a closet.

Statesman (London) - Monday 16 March 1812

Nottingham  
March 13

The Commission of Assize has just been opened in our Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect :— His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the Calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter

On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame-breaking only, *and no other damage had been done*, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage bad been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the Prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the Prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.

It has been asserted in the House of Commons by Mr. Wynne, and supported by Mr. John Smith, that the Frame-breaking Bill has already had a bad effect, by partly closing up the channels of private Information against the perpetrators. If this is really the case, what good, we would ask, is to be expected from its influence ? for it's terrors have not had the effect of stopping the breaking of frames. If, however, these observations should fall into the hands of the misguided men alluded to, we most earnestly hope that they will take a timely hint, and cease from their destructive and dangerous practices. For, independent of the disquietude such conduct must give to every man's mind, who is concerned in it, on account of the danger of detection, most assured we are that its further prosecution will be attended with the most fatal consequences to the future prosperity of this town and neighbourhood. May our solicitations in this respect not be made is vain !

On Saturday night, seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of Benjamin Topham, of that place; and, what makes the case peculiarly distressing is, the lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*l.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the framebreakers ; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of this town, and two of his own slightly injured ; he having driven them away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence ; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces, about the frames, received considerable injury. What frames were at work, were employed on double press net, and at the full price; therefore, the fair conclusion is, that the violence had its origin in personal spleen ; which, according to his own declaration, as far as his knowledge goes, has been raised against him without any cause whatsoever. The same night two frames were broken at Losco, about four miles on this side Pentridge ; and on Tuesday night, one was carried clean away from Basford.

London Chronicle - Friday 20 March 1812 Topham frames broken

DERBYSHIRE RIOTS.— On Saturday night the 7th inst. seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of B. TOPHAM, of that place; and, what makes the same peculiarly distressing is, these lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*1.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the frame-breakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence ; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace-frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of Nottingham, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven the offenders away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers ; and the silk and lace pieces about the frames received considerable injury. On the same night, a man and his wife, at Swanwick, who are expected to be the principle evidences against two persons confined in Derby gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, were visited, as it is supposed, by the same party, who asailed their dwelling broke their furnitute to pieces, and in some degree injured their persons. They have been removed to Derby as a place of safety. The same night two frames were broken at Losca ; and on Tuesday night one was carried away from Basford.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 March 1812
We understand, that not withstanding the pending severities of the law upon the frame-breakers, ten frames were broken and totally demolished, at Pentrich, on Saturday night last ; and on Tuesday night last, the iron work of one narrow stocking frame was stolen and completely carried off from a house, situated on the Parson's Flat, at Basford, near this town.
