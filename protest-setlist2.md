After "CROPPER SONG V3 + C", Dumb steeple, men formed into ranks and counted out: G - ONE, S - TWO, D - THREE, M - FOUR, E - FIVE

Alibis - watches; washerwoman



As well as the trial of Mellor, Thorpe and Smith, several men were tried in that Special Commission for the part they played in the attack on Rawfolds mill, others for the theft of guns, and others for twisting in, which is to say, administering an illegal oath, to a man who happened to be a magistrate's spy acting under a less than imaginative false name: [READ OATH and use the name M'Donald gave - John Smith]"


And here the tale ends, for the Yorkshire Luddites at least. In Nottinghamshire, outbreaks of violence would reoccur, in 1814, and 1816, about which there are more tales we could tell, although time does not allow it now. The last of the Nottinghamshire Luddite trials would take place in Spring, 1817, for an attack in Loughborough the year before. There had also been Luddite attacks in Lancashire throughout 1812, with large trials at Chester and Lancaster. Manchester was a still a new town, then, without an MP even until the mid-1800s, and for the cotton mill workers in the towns to the west of the Pennines, their grievances were not the result of trying to preserve the old traditions, but a reaction to the way the new industry was taking in workers to feed the new factories, factories that were built around machines from the very beginning, and paying the workers so poorly, even as food prices rose, that they were forced take action themselves. Because then, just as now, you paid once for your machine, but had to pay your workers every week. And you could reduce *that* cost by paying them less. But those stories are also stories that we must save another days. Because unlike the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire Luddites, who had tried to appeal to Parliament for a preservation of the old ways, but whose cause was largely apolitical, in Manchester, where there was no MP, there was also a clamouring for representation, and Parliamentary reform. And so it is to Manchester that we will return, after a short interval, and an opportunity to refill your glasses and maybe pick up some merch, for another short set, of 20 minutes or so, with songs and stories of protest that arose out of the Luddite times, of the Blanketeers, and the Plug Draw rioters.

Plug Drawers - where the riot act was read, and placards announcing the fact that the riot act had be read were displayed around the town.

As we draw to an end, thanks to...; and so to finish off,  [INTO CROPPER LADS IF NOT ALREADY SWITCHED TUNE] we invite you to join in with us in a couple of rounds of the chorus of the Cropper lads, which you can find on the handouts we provided earlier.
