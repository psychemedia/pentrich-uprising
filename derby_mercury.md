Lord SIDMOUTH brought douwn a Message from the Prince Regent, which stated, that His Royal Highness had ordered to be laid before the House Papets containing information of practices, meetings, and combinations carried on in different parts of the kingdom, tending to disturb the public peace and tranquillity, and to endanger the Constitution of these realms, and recommending the House to take the same into its immediate consideration.

The Message having been read,

Lord SIDMOUTH said, pailnful "S it ntost te to o.tae 'he or commnuniacation jrst reil.d it was irlrperililsly called fur, ilil tlI a view to secrre the public peace. and *hie Irat .qrillitr ot t h t ,State.

HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION ACT.

Lord HOLLAND rose to bring forward his motion respecting the Correspondence which had passed between the Secretary of State and the visiting Magistrates of Berkshire, on the subject of the Circular Letter of the Noble Viscount : one of the opinions was stricly illegal. The Noble Lord went over the whole of the questions, and the answers given by the Noble Secretary;  there was a harsh spirit which dictated these answers, he observed, as referable to many of the questions. The Act of the 31st of the King, giving power to the visiting Magistrates to visit the prisons, no exception being made in he case of any prisoner. Now the fact was, that two Magistrates applied to visit the prison, and were refused permission, the orders of the Secretary of State to the contrary being shewn to them. This conduct, the Noble Lord contended, was an ururption of the Bill of Rights, and certainly an infringement of the statute law of the land, and of the Constitution, and exercising an authority which belonged alone to the Legislature. He concluded with moving for the production of the Correspondence referred to.

Lord SIDMOUTH assued the House that in the execution of an arduous office he had always endeavored to do his duty, but if his condusct was liable to comment, he desired not to shrink from any responsibility. He had always understood eirtr. tile gr:.rr oftftle kirgdlomn were subject to the exercise of the ?? evesagative. Withi respect to tiler3srrrflbe King, tl it tlie ltrryal }'iermng'rite was to be excepted, a special enact- C orerit onrr.t to have been introd iced tur tbat prrrpnise. Il the i tirare of Lords Vlolt mid llayinrtnrd. the peomissior 4or a wife to . are her burtbarnd (coritmitted lfr lligh Irea5srrr,) was deird. h Sinmiar refusais had been givenI it rrthler cases of state prison- s vr. 15itirurrt arrogating to hirmrself any itmore hurirarrity tirthnr d bis predecestrrs. ?? t right say, tirat lie bad on some occssiorrs e exercised a degree of dicrrtiart favnitrrbie to tbe prisoners; I and crrtended that io no irrstatice bad fie departed frorn pre. n cedertr, nor alierd loe exercised airy extraorritrary degree of t harshoess, suesh as was ituputed t1 him. by the Noble Lord. d If tire House intended to throw blrre upori hin, they could agree to tie arotion. As :ar as riS own vote *went, lie ceL- taiuly shouid object to it.

Earl GREY supported the motion, contending that it was harsh to deny prisoners the use of paper or books.

The Earl of LIVERPOOL opposed the motion, on the grounds stated by his Noble Friend.

The Earl of ROSSLYN supported the motion.

The Lord CHANCELLOR and the Earl of LIVERPOOL objected to the motion, which was negatived without a division.

HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION.

Friday.â€” Lord HOLLAND presented the Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of London against the continuance of the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, which was read and ordered to lie on the table.

Lord HOLLAND said, he hoped and trusted this Petition would be followed up by others, until the general expression of public opinion compelled the inisters of the Crown to abandon the system they were now pursuing, which was so highly detrimental to the interests of the country.

THE LATE INSURRECTION

In our last publication, we discharged a most painful duty, and announced the appearance of all alarming insurrection, extending along the northern aiitwardlv, or Nottinghamshire sidie of this coami y, But we abstained fro1 lilly attempt to giveL et detniield accoulit of whiat lunl(1 happened, not bfecarisa ne avere insensible of the deep, itlierest which this evient lind excited, or were iil- willial either to relieve the anxiety, or gratify the curiosity of the public, huut saoely fi ia a considera- thin of our duty i i he magistrates had but joist entered upon the inveStifantioit' the bhSilles,-W I th obvious pro1riety, the'> vtere coiiduactinit the eluetasin- tion of the1 ,vitiicsses in ?? authentic hid :transpired.- AVe neiienher wtiled, on the one hlaod, t1 ?? ilie.Oxistitlg n,, by giving our silltctioll to the various repoits ,alii a erc in circulation, and create a prejudice against those unfortunate men, who had heeil made prisoners; nor, ott the o-br, to uuder- rate the danger from which we hite been provideniiall:, rescued by the incessarot vigilance of the Government, the active exertions of our Magistrates, and the zealous Co operation of the Milititsarv. j . It is almost unniecessary for ns to advert, to thoe tuiceasing exertions, which have been itade for ?? years, to excite a spirit oh' disconitelit, and sedition, in the lower classes oth'e. people throughout the kingdom, The success of these exertions, aided as they have been IIV the speeches ofi men of high rauk in societv, both in, asd out of parliament, by the most gross afbuse of the liberty of the press, aid b5y that distress which has of late pervaded the liation, and which the nianuhictulrinlg, iani labouring poor have been taught to believe has been brought upon them, by a corrupt and, a icked government, has been long visible in a neighloburing county, and we grieve to acknowledge, that lt leutal it is become apparent it this. To these causes we refer all the nuiscliief which lasarisenand has been coiiteinsplatel. It is well known, that toward the latter end of the last, and in the beginning of the present year, political Clubs were formed, upon the teeionlillendatli ot a meeting, held in London abotit twelve nifjitjis ag0o throughout the midlind, and Wotitern dist -Its'oitider the thie of Herapiden Cliobs, and ibr the ostensible purpose of obtaining a reform in Parliament. We are far from condemning political associations having a lawful object, and pursuinig that object by lawful, and constitutional tneais; aor cau we ceinsureilidiscrinmilitely all the members of thbee particular institutions, altho' we are naiare that life nmosttalaliling nischlief hasiltisen from tiem. There are mriiny honest, and we might adtl h)yal nien wlo have been members of these clubs heat %ve are forced by discoveries, and events, to declare our opinion, that such men have been duped, and have unconsciously given their sanction to projects of the most desperate, and horrid nature. We do not presume to define the character of the late ilsuanection it may be treason, it may be sedition;-this Iaust be admitted at all events th:at it was of a atost dangerous tendency,-aad there can lie no doubt but that it is the overt act of a conspiracy, extending throughout the manufacturing and populouis parts of the inidhiited and tiorthern counties; formed and unhappily brought into action in this County, by delegates from the llainpden Oucieiiies. It appears that two or three previous days, and at length that Monday the 9th instant, vas fixedi for a general insurrection in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire, and that inlitleise bodies of men, armed with guns, pikes; and other o(neasive weapons, were to have marched out ol Lancashire, and Yorkshiret, over the northeistivardly side of this county, and the wvestoardly side of Nottnligamhlire, into trle town ut INCottingainm. libty wcere to ha ve fi)rced into their ser- vice every person lound on their marci, aid capable of ahiordinig them any assistailce, and to have provideol further supplies of arms, particulariy guns, which they were most il want of, by tawliig them out of private houses, and depots of military stores. It seenas that they were to have remnained at Nottingham amund to have established a provisional Government there until they heard of the success of similar operations in other parts of the kingdom, aiid a convenliton was then to be held for the formation of a constitution, according to their I Val notions of civil, and religious hibelt. Under this delusion, a party of about fifty or sixty men from ttheile village, auh neighbourhood of outili iug- field, uutder the couiinttith of a leader, deputed ?? the I toluVI Nottingham, ariied with pikes, and soomc guns, assembled ahout 12 o'clock in the night of Monday the 9th inst. ini W ingfitld Park.-They proceeded at once to break;open all the farm houses, and ,5ossess themselves ot all the guns, u ud tire arnis, qo Wilsc' thry-ad aeccurase acrrtlts, a lhci nere ioun(d on l tenil. At Mr. llep- worth's, a most horrid and wantoni murder was coin- m illed: In conuequence o: the nliise on the outside of the house, toe servant alan caine down stairs to the kitchen, and having refused to open the door, and rieti- %er his master's gun?? to the insurgents, he was instantly shijt through the window, a hich tad beea brokrai,atir ?? dead. This shocking act appears to have created lo sensation of disgust iu any ot tle insurgents;-they proceeded to break open other hlioses ; and reterred to the murder, only to entinrce their threats, and intitaidt. te those a ho shewed the least reluctance to jilin teiil ! ! At the salile hour a pal ty of insurgeants, lasse~iitleld i0- the Udj llilg village of' Peltritg1e, the Seat of thle conspirary, & the ihilca of residence ofle vst ?? and aictivL liawpidlcd Club delceatc. 'Jhius parlty proceeded to lenutridge Laue end , to await the arrival of their -Cotiniander, and associates fioni WViiglleld F:ark'.

Ihle insurgents remained iiearlv an hour at the public house at tlie tiortliatirdly end of Codilor Comimioin, prto- bily in the expectation of ?? reinforcements??, and dispatches from the town of Nottingham.-flere notwithstanding the reireshiaents which eregivel to thein by their commander, their spirits becanme evidently depressed. Their nollbers aiiiodilred to about three hundred but they had expected a much greater anuguien- trtion,-and tho' it mlas nols about six o'clock, ?? they were without intelligence of the expected surrender of the Barracks, and the town of Nottingham to their assiociatesin tanarter. Still they proceeded on.Wds towards Langley Bridge, the last village in this county. Between Codior and Ltngley ilcey met the l-'eutridge Couier Oil his rict urn front NiOttmiigiham. le delivered his dispatclies to the Commander, ald they were pre- clainied to be of the most lflvouratle nature.- Nottingham, it was said was gircn iup-i.4e soldiers in the Lerrrl;s wolditt not stir"-annrtlie insurgents elre ordered to push torwvard and join their victorious comrades. But there was something in the counteiailce and conduct of the Couaiei-alid the subsequent move- iltelts of the cotilndlilet' which contradicted the report of this intelligence. The messenger himself disappeared ;-thie couiiniander qitted the lear of the party and took the lead of it; he quickened his nmarch;. auit became regardless of the desertions which took place at every cross road nud collner. However they proceeded as far as him berley, at which place their numbers were reduced to about fifty-here they were oet and immediately repulsed by a party of ltussnrs under the command of Captain l'hilliplis from Nottingham, accompanied by Charles U. :luidy and Lancelot RoHiestoll; Esqrs. two most active Magistrates ?? the county f Nottingham. Several prisoners, and a considerable number of pikes, guns, pitch-forks and other oflfdisive =Sapous were taken and carried under an escort of the Hussars into Nottinghan.
