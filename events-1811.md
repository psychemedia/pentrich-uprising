Ned Ludd, a mythical character, in whose name these things are done. But Ned Ludd is not any one person. Rather like Jack, the hero of many a traditional tale, Jack, the everyman, Ned Ludd is an every-man of the working people. He may not exist as a person, but jhe exists as an idea. And as local leaders rise up and gather men together to act in his name, in a sense, they become him. They all become him.

FRAME-BREAKING.—The mischievous spirit of frame-breaking, we regret to state, still continues: on Monday night last, some person or persons entered the workshop of John Stevenson, at Bulwelll, in this neighbourhood, and maliciously broke and destroyed six stocking frames, belonging to different individuals. Not content with this act of mischief, they wantonly set fire to some cotton yarn, and stole and carried away some hose, also divers articles of wearing apparel, and some provisions, The same night two other frames, rented by the said John Stevenson, standing in another work-shop were totally demolished in like manner.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 23 November 1811

The lawless and outrageous proceedings which we had the painful duty of recording in our last, have, in a great degree, subsided, owing to the vigorous and decisive measures adopted by the High Sheriff and the Magistrates, aided by the military. Since the apprehension of some of the most active of the rioters, and the assemblage of a considerable military force, the mischievous designs of the more violent have been effectually restrained, and no further attempt to disturb the public peace has been made. Only one instance of frame-breaking has come to our knowledge since our last, and that took place at a house in Acomb Lane, Old Radford, on Monday night last, where one wide frame was broken to pieces. Many threats, however, have been held out against others; and on Tuesday night, in consequence of a stone being thrown through the window of a workshop which was threatened at New Radford, a part of the guard of the Local Militia marched to garrison the house, and also another, which had been threatened in like manner, while the remainder of the guard continued to patrole the road throughout the night, and thus the property was effectually preserved.— It would appear, however, that the frame breaking employment has, for the present been changed for one of a more diabolical nature; on Saturday night leat, some vile incendiary set fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Stirrup, of the Swan Inn, Mansfield, by which nearly 20 tons of hay were destroyed. This act of diabolical mischief is supposed to have been perpetrated by some desperate characters out of revenge to Mr. Stirrup, in consequence of having furnished post horses to a party of seven dismounted dragoons, who proceeded with some of the Mansfield yeomanry to suppress the riots at Sutton in Ashfield. A similar revenge was taken on Monday night, by setting fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Lewis. of Snenton, near this town, whose son is a member of the Holme-Pierrepent troop of yeomanry, which was last week called out on duty ; and on Tuesday night last, two hay ricks, the property of Mr. Hardstaff and Mr. Toon, at Hucknall Torkard in this county, were maliciously set on fire and destroyed.

The first regiment of Nottingbanwhire Local Militia assembled here on Friday last under the command of Lieut. Col. Wright, and have remained on duty every since. It reflects infinite credit on the corps, that at so alarming a crisis there is scarcely a man absent but what can be accounted for. A Captain's guard is mounted every night.

The dragoons at the barracks have been strengthened by a small detachment of the Scots' Greys, from Lichfield.

On Wednesday a squadron if the 15th dragoons (hussars) arrived here from Colchester, and yesterday morning detachments of them were sent to Mansfield, and the villages in this neighbourhood, where they are for the present to be stationed.

Yesterday se'nnight, an express arrived from the High Sheriff of this county, for the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry to muster at Red Hill, near this town, with all possible speed, to assist in quelling the disturbances which have taken place in this neighbourhood. The troop mustered with an alacrity which does them the greatest credit, and arrived at the place appointed by half past four o'clock in the afternoon, where they halted and formed into line. There appearing no disposition to riot that night, and the Bunny troop being upon the ground, they returned to Southwall until further orders, which arrived on Saturday at noon, for their return home. They mustered eighty-three strong.

We are authorised to state, in contradiction to the assertion in the *Review* of last week, that instead of nearly 300 of the mob, which proceeded from Arnold to Sutton in Ashfield, being armed with fire-arns, there were not more than 20 that had weapons of that description.

Morning Post - Monday 18 November 1811
SERIOUS RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM. A riotous spirit has of late been manifested, by the Manufacturers having brought i.ito use a certain wide frame, for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, by which was produced a considerable saving in manual labour, tending stilt further to the de- crease of the hands employed. On Sunday night last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at d

Nottingham Review - Friday 29 November 1811

We stated a hope in our last, that the violence exercised in this neighbourhood in the breaking of stocking frames, was about subsiding, but in that respect we have been deceived ; and we have now again the painful duty to perform, of recording renewed acts of aggression. And though from the various rumours which are daily coming to our ears, it is impossible to pledge ourselves for the critical exactness of our narrative, yet we believe the following will be pretty near the truth, respecting the riotous occurrences of the week :—

On Saturday night, one frame was broken at Ilkiston, the first town on the verge of Derbyshire from hence ; but, from both coercive and conciliatory measures being resorted to, we believe the mischief has been stopped ; for we have not heard of any acts of aggression being committed there since. On the same night, one frame was broken, in an otherwise empty house, in Cyprus-street, Nottingham; it being the first instance of the kind in this place for many years. Five others in York-street, and one on Mount East, were broken on Monday night, notwithstanding a party of special constables parade the streets every night. In consequence of these acts of outrage, and applications being made for protection by several persons who considered their property in danger, the Mayor and Aldermen issued out a spirited handbill, stating that they had ordered a number of constables to be in constant readiness at the Police office, for the immediate protection of any of the inhabitants that applied ; since which time, no outrages have been committed in the town. In the neighbourhood, however, this has not been the case; for, at Carlton, one frame was broken Wednesday night, and many others prevented from sharing the same fate, by the timely appearance of a party of dragoons. At Chilwell, one was broken and the woodwork burnt on Monday morning: and report states, that several have been destroyed, in course of the week, at Hucknall Torkard, Bulwell, Dob Park, Eastwood, &c. But Basford has been the principal scene of action ; for, notwithstanding the presence of both the civil and military powers, thirty one frames were destroyed on Sunday night, twenty on Monday night, thirteen on Tuesday night, and six on Wednesday night ; and at noon on the latter day, one was broken near Red Hill, as it was coming under an escort of dragoons from Arnold to Nottingham, the soldiers, avoided proceeding to extremities, not having the power to obstruct the rioters in their determined purpose.

An intelligent and respectable correspondent at Basford has favored us with the following circumstances, and desires a place for them in our home news, as illustrative of the temper and disposition of the rioters:—

" One house that they went into, they had much trouble to obtain a light ; and, while rummaging a cupboard for something with which to procure one, they discovered some plate and other valuables ; but, having obtained a bit of paper, they shut to the cupboard door, nor touched any thing in the house but the frames, which were the object of their vengeance. In another house it was well understood, that from fifty to seventy golden guineas were kept by the master ; but, having exercised their wrath upon the obnoxious IRON, they left the GOLD in quiet possession of the owner. At another house, the master offered them a considerable portion of money if they would spare the frames; but their answer was, that they wanted not his money, but the destruction of those instruments which prevented them from obtaining a livelihood in an honest manner. One poor man begged of the rioters to spare two frames that had been the fruit of his industry for many years: his request was granted."

In the course of the week several persons have been brought in by the soldiers, on suspicion of being concerned in the breaking of frames ; they were all liberated except one, and he is not committed.

The Nottingham Local Militia, under the command of Lientenant-Colonel Wright, was disembodied on Wednesday last ; and we are happy to state, that the conduct of the men, while on duty, has been such as to merit the approbation both of their officers and the inhabitants of the town at large. On their departure, the military duty of the town, which is considered indispensible at the present moment, was performed by the Recruiting Staff, by order of Colonel Grey, the Commander of the District, until relieved by a division of the Southwell Local Militia, under the command of Captain Taylor, who marched in here on Thursday evening.

We are likewise happy in having to, state, that several of our hosiers have given notice to their workmen, that they will not have any more CUT-UP goods made ; while others have stated their intention of paying the usual prices for making stockings. Messrs. Lacy and Seals, Lace Manufacturers, have published a hand-bill, anouncing their determination of paying, what is considered at the present time, the standard price for making net, and likewise that of taking the regular rent for frames.

Just before our paper was sent to press, we learnt, that four frames were last night broken at Basford, and their woodworks burnt. Five frames were also destroyed the same evening at Bobbers Mill.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 December 1811

Since the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers held on the 4th ant. the messes of the frame-breakers have been eonaidetably note limited , and every thing has again aieunied the appprince of returning tranquillity in the vicinity of this town. We have hard of only three instances of the destruction of frames since our last, viz. 6 at Bill. well, and 4 at Arnold, on Saturday night last ; and at Burton Joyce, on Wednesday night. No violence whatever,  AND CONTINUES

...

DERBY Dec. 11. It is with extreme regret we state to our readers that the distrubances which have caused so much agitation in Nottinghamshire, have extended into our own county. We understand that the town of Ilkeston, and the villages of Makeney, Heage, Holbrook, Crich, &c., have suffered considerably from the visits of the Frame-Breakers, the particulars of which we have not been able to learn, but are informed, from the best authority, that frames of all descriptions have been destroyed, without discrimimation. From the following account, which we have received from a correspondent, it appears that at Pentrich and the neighbourhood, their proceedings have been most destructive: soon after midnight, on the 1st instant, the Frame-Breakers, armed with weapons, arrived at Pentrich, and proceeded to the house of Mr B. Topham; knocking at the door, they demanded the key of his workshop, and a light. On opening the door, they presented three guns at him, threatening to blow his brains out if he did not comply with their demands: he told them he had no frames of the description they were in search of (for cut-up work), nor were there any in the town; and having somewhat appeased them by conciliatory language, they left his house, one of them cursing the man who had sent them thither. After going to a few more shops in the village, they departed, without doing any mischief, but threatening to return some future night and demolish those frames that were worked at an under price, or by those persons who are termed *Colts*. Accordingly, on the following evening, the neighbourhood was again visited by them, but on finding that the prices had been raised, they were satisfied without breaking any frames, excepting one at Oakenthorpe, one at South Wingfield Park, and one at Wessington. On Saturday night the seventh, about the hour of twelve, with most destructive purpose they came again to Pentrich, and literally broke into shivers ten stocking frames, and also two lace frames, notwithstanding full proces have been given. The two lace frames were worked by Mr. Topham, who, as the mob were entering his shop, chanced to be at a short distance from his house, on his return from Nottingham, and learning what was going forward, with much presence of mind ran to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and begain to ring the bells; on hearing which the rioters were alarmed and precipitately retreated. They afterwards demolished a frame a short distance from the village, and proceeded to Swanwick, where they broke three frames, and also two at Riddings, both near Alfreton. At Ilkeston, about thrity frames have been injured in the course of the week.

The most prompt and vigilant measures have been adopted by the Magistrates for the county to suppress these alarming proceedings, and restore the public tranquility, which we trust will be speedily effected.— On Monday, the Derby and Chaddesden Troops of Yeomanry Cavalry were ordered to assemble here on duty, and mustered in the evening with the greatest alacrity; and yesterday they were joined by the Radborne troop. They have been engaged in the whole of the last nights in different divisions, protecting the neighbouring villages and places where the most apprehension was entertained. The Derby and Chaddesden troops were releived from duty this afternoon, by the arrival of a troop of Scots Greys from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here until further orders. —*Derby Mercury*.

Globe - Monday 16 December 1811

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

We have received letters and papers from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester, our extracts from which shew, that the disturbances which first broke out in the county of Nottingham, are extending with alarming rapidity to the neighbouring counties. Nottingham, where we were led to believe that all disputes between the manufacturers and their employers were in a train of accommodation, the turbulent spirit of the rioters, encouraged long impunity, is manifested in the acts of incendiaries; in the county of Derby, the number of frames broken within the last eight days exceed 110; and in Leicester, we fear, we shall soon have to record similar acts of violence. Government, we understand, wished in the instance to leave the suppression'of these disturbances to the magistracy, who, with the military, have, throughout, been alike active and indefatigable; but it must be evident that the rioters are too well organised, act too systematically, and receive too correct information, to be suppressed without other aids.

LEICESTER, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. Rumours are in circulation here, that a party of frame-breakers have visited one or two villages in our vicinity: but the extent of the damage, or whether any, is not known. Our yeomanry have been on duty for some days past. The King’s Guards (Blues) arrived yesterday morning; and the Cumberland Militia have been ordered thither from Cambridge.

DERBY, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. It is with extreme regret we state, that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in a neighbouring county, have broken out here with destructive violence: At Holbrook, Crich, Heage, and Pentridge, not fewer than between 40 and 50 frames, of all descriptions, have been broken since Saturday last. A party of these deluded men visited Pentridge thrice in one night (the 1st inst.) not finding the frames they were in search of at Mr. Topham's, they departed without doing any mischief, but giving caution to the people not work at an under price, nor encourage colts among them, threatening otherwise they would return and demolish their frames. On the second visit they were pacified at finding that the prices had been raised, and contented themselves with demolishing three frames at Oakerthorpe, &c. On Saturday night they returned and broke twelve frames, notwithstanding full prices having been given. Two of the lace frames belonged to Mr. Topham, who, not being at home on their arrival, but learning what was going forward, ran with gteat presence of mind to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells ; hearing which the rioters were alarmed, and precipitateiy retired. They afterwards demolished several frames at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley. At Ilkeston about 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week. The reason which has been circulated for the frame breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that one hosier had hitimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames to the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Measures have been adopted to prevent arms falling into the hands of the rioters, and the Derby and Chadderton yeomanry cavalry have been called out. A troop of Scots Greys has also arrived from Nottingham, which is to br stationed here. The military are authorised to act in case of falling in with the rioters.

NOTTINGHAM, FRIDAY AFTFUNOON, DEC. 13. We had flattered ourselves that the publication of the Resolution agreed to at a Meeting of the Hoseirs and Lace Manufacturers would have caused the frame-breakera to suspend their destructive proceedings throughout the county ; but though no act of violence has occurred in this town for the last ten days, they have not ceased elsewhere. At Bulwell and Arnold ten frames wore broken on Saturday Sunday, and two at Baston Joyce on Wednesday night.

Three o'clock. —After flattering ourselves with the hopes of approaciiing tranquillity, it is doubly painful to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, flour-seller in this town, were last night set fire to at Bastord ; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latter only a small part was saved.—At this moment an extraordinary meeting is sitting at the Shire Hall, consisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the county) Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warres, Sir T. W. White, and the Magistrates, to take into consideration the alarming and destructive state of the county, to receive informations, and to endeavour to ascertain the means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority.

Star (London) - Monday 16 December 1811
NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

The latest accounts received from Nottingham state, that in the immediate vicinity, the only mischief recently done is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. It has been more extensive in Derbyshire; for on Saturday se'nnight, near Pentridge, 18 frames were broken and several destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason publicly circulated for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge is, that some hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that their visit was to deter him. Two lace-frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of his going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.

Precautions for the protection of property continue both at Nottingham and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton's Hall, where arms are deposited has been guarded for 17 successive nights, lest they should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal, in case of alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself; the Workmen in the frame-work knitting-trade are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices ; the latter lend a favourable ear to such solicitations, and we understand on Friday held a meeting at the Exchange-hall, on the subject.—After such favourable appearances, it is painful to record new aggressions . Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, were on Friday night set fire to at Basford, the gormer entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part saved.

We are informed, that on Thursday a frame was broken at Burton. The depredators escaped deteetion, though horse and foot soldiers were in the village.

An extraordinary meeting sat at the Shire Hall on Friday, to consider the state of the country, to hear complaints, and to examine into the means by which the rioters support themselves. There were present the Duke of Newcastle, Viscount Newark, Sir J. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &c., and the Magistracy of the county.

Wednesday, the 11th inst. was committed for trial at the Assizes, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, lace manufacturer, for feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed "Ned Lud and Co." directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. threatening break and destrooy their frames, and injure his person and that of T. Clarke, concerned in such manufacture. The appearance of the rioters was feared at Leiceiter.

Nottingham Riots

Derby, Thursday, December 12th

It is with extreme regret we state, that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in a neighbouring county, have broken out here with destructive violence: At Holbrook, Crich, Heage, and Pentridge, not fewer than between 40 and, 50 frames, of all descriptions have been broken since Saturday last. A party of these deluded men visited Pentrick [*sic*] thrice on the first night (the 1st inst.) not finding the frames they were in search of at Mr. Tophams's, they departed without doing any mischief, but giving a caution to the people not to work at an under price, nor encourage *colts* among them,threatening otherwise they would return and demolish their frames. On the second visit they were pacified at finding that the prices had been raised, and contented themselves with demolishing three frames at Oakerthorpe, &c. On Saturday they returned and broke twelve frames, notwithstanding full prices having been given. Two of the lace frames belongedto Mr Topham, who not being at home on their arrival, but learning what was going forward, ran with a great presence of mind to the vicarage house, and E having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither and began o ring the bells: on hearing which, the rioters were alarmed, and precipitately retired. They afterwards demolished several frames at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley. At Ilkeston about, 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week. The reason which has been circulated for, the frame breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that one hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames to the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Measures have been adopted to prevent arms failing into the hands of the rioters, and the Derby and Chaddetdon yeomanry cavalry have been called out. A troop of Scots Greys has also arrived from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here. The military are authorised to act in case of falling in with the rioters.

Nottingham, Friday afternoon, Dec. 13.

We had flattered ourselves that the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the hosiers and lace manufacturers would hake caused the frame-breakers to suspend their destructive proceedings throughout the county ; but though no act of violence has occurred in this town for the last ten days, they have not ceased elsewhere. At Bulwell and Arnold ten frames were broken on Saturday and Sunday, and two at Buston Joyce on Wednesday night. At the latter place, we are informed, that a frame was broken yesterday, and that the depredators escaped, though there were parties both of horse and foot soldiers in the village.

Nottingham, 3 o'clock Friday afternoon.

After flattering ourselves with the hopes of approachinig tranquillity, it is doubly painful to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr Pepper, flower-seller in this towns were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latterl only a small part was saved.— At this moment an extraordinary meeting is sitting at the shire hall, consisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the county), Viscount Newark, Sir J.
