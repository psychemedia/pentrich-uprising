(anf from 1816 "It is very singular, that three of the these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago, in his shop, at that village, along with a number more, two of which have made very little work, and the other none since they were repaired." https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/search?q=Pentrich)

Ned Ludd, a mythical character, in whose name these things are done. But Ned Ludd is not any one person. Rather like Jack, the hero of many a traditional tale, Jack, the everyman, Ned Ludd is an every-man of the working people. He may not exist as a person, but jhe exists as an idea. And as local leaders rise up and gather men together to act in his name, in a sense, they become him. They all become him.

March 1816 New Radford - frames owned by Topham,

And so we find ourselves back at Pentrich. Remember Pentrich, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham, where in late 1816 and early 1817, ?? Topham had ?? destroyed? Pentrich.

FRAME-BREAKING.—The mischievous spirit of frame-breaking, we regret to state. still continues: on Monday night last, some person or persons entered the ' workshop of John Stevenson, at Zulwelll, in this nigh t bourhood, and maliciously broke and destroyed six stocking frames, belonging to different individuals. Nat content with this act of mischief, they wantonly set fire to some cotton yarn, and stole and carried away some hose s also divers articles of we ring apparel, and some provisions, The same night two other frames, rented by the said John Stevenson, standing in another work-shop t were totally demolished in like manner

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 23 November 1811
The lawless and outrageous proceedings which we had the painful duty of recording in our last, have, in a great degree, subsided, owing to the vigorous and decisive measures adopted by the High Sheriff and the Magistrates, aided by the military. Since the apprehension of some of the most Reticle: of the rioters, and the assemblage of a considerable military force, the mischievous deigns of the more violent have been effectually restrained, a nd no further attempt to disturb the public peace has been made. Only one instance of frame-breaking has come to our know- ledge since our last, and that took place at a keine in Acomb Lase Old Radford, on Monday night last, where one wide frame was broken to pieces. Many threats, however, have hens held mit agamst alms; and on Tuesday night, ioconeeepsnee of a stew heir g thrown through the dow of a weekothepâ which was threatened at New Radford, a pan of die guard of the Local Militia marched to garrison the home, and al* another, which had' been treaterec! in like manner, *Weft* remainder ofthe guard oncntnued top l, the road throughout the ght, and â¢ thus the property was effectually preserved.--It would appear, however, that thit bow beeeku.g emplcynient has, 

for 4te„Froduut.bauf 'hanged far tine of a more diabolical nature:von Saturday night leat, Mike Vile inceedistriet fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Stirrup. of the Swan Inn, Mansfield, by which nearly it) sons - of hay were. destroyed. This act el diabolical mimhief is supposed Co have been perpetrated by some desperate characters out of revenge to Mt, Stirrup. in consequence of having furnished p o st horses to a party of seven dinneunted,dragoons, who proceeded with some of the Mansfield yeomanry to suppref./ the riots at Sutton in Ashfield. A similar revenge was taken on Monday night, by setting firs to a hay rick, belonging to Mt. Lewis. of Snenev, near this town, whose snit is a member of the Holme-Pierrepent troop-of yeomanry, which was last week called out osseluty ; and on Tuesday night last, two hay ricks, the property of Mr. Hardstaff and Mr. Toon, at Hucknall Torkard t in this county, were maliciously set on fire and destroyed. The first regiment of Nottingbanwhire Local Militia assembled here en Friday last tinder the command of Lieut. Col. Wright, and have remained en duty every since. It , reflects infinite credit on the corps. that at so alarming a crisis there is scarcely a man absent but what can be accounted for. A Captain's guard is mounted every night. The dragoons at the barracks have' been strenrhened by a small detachment of the Scots' Greys, fronil.tchfield. On Wednesday a squadron if the zyth dragoons (bosun) arrived here from Colchester, and yesterday morning detachments of them were sent to Mansfield, and the villages in this neighbourhood, where they avatar the present to be stationed. Yestenlay se'unight, an express arrived from the High Sheriff of this county, for the Newark Trollop of Yeomanry Cavalry to muster at Red Hill.. near this town, with all possible speed, to assist in quelling the disturbances which have taken place in this utighbouhood. The troop mustered with an alacrity which does them the greatest credit, and arrived at the plate appointed by half past tour o'clocl; in the afternoon, where they halted and formed into bat. There appearing no disposition to riot that night, and the Bunny troop being upon the ground, they returned to Southwall until farther orders, vithirh mired en Saturday at noon, for their return haute. •'lliey mustered eightythree strong. We are authorised to state, in.contradictiou to the assertion in the Review of hut week, that instead of nearly WO of the mob, which rroceesisid from Arnold to Sutton in Ashtield, being arms., with fire-amts, there were not more than 20 that had weapons of that description.

SERIOUS RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM. A riotous spirit has of late been manifested, by the Manufacturers having brought i.ito use a certain wide frame, for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, by which was produced a considerable sav- ing in manual labour, tending stilt further to the de- crease of the hands employed. On Sunday night last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at d

Nottingham Review - Friday 29 November 1811

We stated a hope in our last, that the violence cx. ercised in this neighbomhtmd in the breaking of stocking frames, was al t mbsiding, but in that respect we have been deceived ; and we have now again the painful duty to perform, of recording renewed acts of aggress' . And though from the various rumours which arc daily coming to our ears, it is impossible to pledge ourselves for the critical exartnes. of our narrative, vet we believe the following will be pretty near the truth, respecting the riotous occurrences of the week :— On Saturday night, frame was broken at 11. Liston, the first town on the verge of Derbyshire from hence ; but, from both coercive and conciliatory measures being resorted to, at: Melieve the mix. has been stopped ; for we have not beard of any acts of aggression being committed there since. On the same night, one frame was broken, in an otherwise empty house, in Cyprus-street, Nutting. ham; it being the first iintance of the kind in this place fur many year.. Five others in l ork-street, and one on Mount 'East, were broken on Monday night, notwithstanding a party of special constables parade the streets every night. In consequence of these acts of outrage, and applications being made for protection by several persons who considered their properly in danger, the Mayor and Aldermen issued out a spirited handbill, slating that they had ordered a number of constthles to be in constant readiness at the Police otlice, for the immediate protect' of any of the inhabitants that applied ; since which time, no outrages have been committed in the (ono. lit the neighbour) d, however, this has not been h case; for, at Carbon, one frame was utt ednesday night, and many others pre. vented from sharing the same tate, by the timely ap. pearancy of a party of dragoon:. At thilaell, one was broken and the wood.wotk burnt on Monday morning: and report states, that several have bee,, destroyed, in course of the week, at 11mknall Torkard, nob Park, Eastwood, &e. liut Hanford has been the principal scene of action ; for, notwithstanding the presence of both the ci. vil and militicy powers, thirty one frames were destroyed on ' , outlay night, twenty on M lay night, thirteen on Tuesday night, and six ots Wednesday night : and at noon on the latter day, one was bro.. ken near Red Hill, as it was coming tinder an escort ofdrag s from Arnold to Nottingham, the Rol. fliers, avoided proceeding to extremities, not having the power to obstruct the rioters in their determined purpose. An intelligent and respectable correspondent al liasford has favored us with the following stances, and desires a place for them in our home news, as illustrative of the temper and disposition of the rioters:_.. " One house that they went into, they had much trouble to obtain a light ; and, while rummaging a cupboard fur something with which to procure one, they discovered some plate and other valuables ; but, having obtained a bit of paper, they shut to the cupboard door, nor touched any thing in the house but the frames, which were the object of their vengeance. In another house it was well understood, that from fifty to seventy golden guineas were kept by the .master ; but, having exercised their wrath upon the obnoxious IRON, they left the GOLD iu pike possession of the owner. At another house, the master ollCred them a considerable portion of motley if they would spare the frames; but their an. swer was, that they wanted not his money, but the destruction of those instruments which pre. vented them from obtaining a livelihood in an honest manner. One l man begged of the rioters to spare two frames that had been the fruit of his in. dustry for many years: his request was granted." In the course of the week several persons have been brought in by the soldiers, on suspicion of he_ ing conceroed in the breaking of frames ; they were all liberated except one, and hr is not committed. The Nottingham Local Militia, under the command of Lientenant-Colonel IVright, was disembo. died on W't•dnesday last ; and we are happy to state, that the conduct of the men, while on duty, has been such as to merit the approbati both of their officers and the inhabitants of the town at large. On their departure, the military duty of the town, which is considered indispensible at the present moment, was performed by the Recruiting Staff, by order of Colonel Grey, the Commander of the District, until relieved by a division of the Southwell Local Militia, under the command of Captain Taylor, who marched in here on Thursday evening. We are likewise happy in having to, state, that several of our Rosier% have given notice to their workmen, tliat they will not have any more CUT.UP goods made ; while others have stated their intention of paying the u►ual prices for making stockings. Messrs. Lacy and Seals, Lace :Manufacturers, have published a hand-bill, anouneing their determination of paying, what is con , idered at the present time, the standard price fur making net, and likewise that of taking the regular rent for frames. . before our paper was sent to press, we learnt, that four frames were last nighl broken at IlAsforil, and their woodworks burnt. Five frames were also ile.lroyed the same evening at Hohbers Mill.

Since the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers held on the 4th ant. the messes of the frame-breakers have been eonaidetably note limited , and every thing has again aieunied the appprince of returning tranquillity in the vi. ' cinity of this town. We have hard of only three instances of the destruction of frames since our last, viz. 6 at Bill. well, and 4 at Arnold, on Saturday night last ; and I at Burton Joyce, on Wednesday night.

Nottingham Riots

Derby, Thursday, Deceubet 12 h It is -with extreme regret we state, that the distur- ir bancet~'-kh have 'caused' so much agitation in a d hnighbouriiilg couity, have' brok n out here with de o structive violence: At H6olbrook, Rich, Heage, I and Ptntridge, 'not fewer than between 40. and, 50 tI frames, of all descriptions have been broken since M Satuiday last. A party of t1ese deluded men visit- I ed Pentrick fhfiice on' the first night (tie st ifnl)t not findin'g the frames they were in search odat Mr so Topharm's,-thiey departed. without-doing airy mischief, 1 but giving a caution to the people not to work at an o under price, nor encourage colts amongthem,threaten- h ing otherwise they wouild return and demolish their 'frames. On the secdnd visit they were pacified at n finding that-the prices had been raised, and content- c ed themselves with demolishing three frames at s Oakerthorpe, &c. On Saturday they returned and o broke twelve 'frames, notwithstanding full prices hav- f ing'bee- 'given'. Two of the lace 'frames belonged ti to Mr Tophams who not being at home on their ar- t] rival,'but 'learning what wasgoingfbrward ran with a great presence of" mind to the vicarage house, and E having' obtained the Jkey of the church, proceeded -e 'thither and began t& ring the bells: on hearing d which, the:riotefs 'were alarmed, and; precipitately re. c tired. They afterwards. demolished several frames v at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley.. At Ilkeston a about, 0 fiames have been injured in the course of -t the -week-. The reason' which has been circulated r -for, the' farae breakees again visiting Pentridge, is, u that one hosier had intimated his intention of fetch- r inig the whole of his frames to the village, and that" . the destructive visit was to deter him from so &Aig - 'Measures-fiave been adopted to prevent arms failing a onto the -haids of the rioters, and the Derby and t Chaddetdon'yeomanry cavalry have been called out. a .A troop of Scots Greys-has. also arrived from Not- c tingham,. whichr is to' be stationed, here. The miii- tary are 'authorised to act in case of falling in with I the rioters. F : 'Noigharn, Friday afternoon, Dec. 13. , ,5r WeLad, flattered ourselves that the publication of 1 the resolutio agreed to at a meeting of the hosiers I and lace. 'naaiufaictuters would hake 'caused the f frarme-breakers to suspend their destructive proceed- c ings thr6ughout 'the county ?? but though no act of ( violence has occurred in this town for the last t'n i days, they have not ceased' elsewhere. At Bulwell f and Armnold ten frames were broken on Saturdayand s Sunday, and' two at Buston Joyce on Wednesday' knight. At'the latter place, we are informed,, that a E frame was broken yesterday, and that the delredators: t :escaped, though there were parties' both of horse and. foot soldiers 'in the village.' Nottinghani, 3 o'clock Friday afternoon. After flattering ourselves with the hopes of ap. t -proachinig tranquillityi it is doubly painful to record new acts -of ?? these too of. the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr Pepper,' flower-seller in this towns .Vere last. night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latterl only-a small part was ?? this moment an ex- traordinary meeting is sitting-at the shire hall, con- sisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant I of the county), Viscount Newark, Sir J. B.. Warren,- Sir T. WT. White, and the Magistiates, to take into consideration the alarming and destructive state of til county, to receive infoiLations, and to endeavoUi7 to ascertain the means by which the rioters sup port thewuselves in the 'exercite of'their lawless author- rity.
