George Mellor, Thomas Smith, 'and William Thorpe.
Friday, January 8th, A.D. 1813 The above three culprits were executed at the new drop behind the Castle walls.
George Mellor, aged 32, cloth-dresser, of Longroyd Bridge ; Thomas Smith, aged 22, cloth -dresser, of Huddersfield ; and William Thorpe, aged 23, cloth-dresser, of Huddersfield. The jury were charged with the prisoners in the usual form, upon an indictment which alleged that the prisoner Mellor, on the 28th of April last, fired a pistol loaded with bullets, &c,, at "William Horsfall, by which firing he received a mortal wound on the left side of the belly, of which wound he languished till the 30th of April, and then died ; and that the prisoners Thorpe and Smith were present, aiding and abetting Mellor to commit the said Crime, and that the three prisoners wilfully murdered the said William Horsfall. The jury found them all guilty, and sentence of death was passed upon them by Justice Le Blanc. Their bodies were afterwards delivered to the surgeons for dissection.
FOURTEEN MALEFACTORS.
Saturday, January IGiA, AD. 1813.— The following fourteen malefactors were executed on the drop behind the Castle, for various burglaries, felonies, and tumultuously assembling in the night-time, to destroy shearing-frames, machinery, to collect fire-arms, and to demolish mills, particularly that of Mr. William Cartwright, at Rawfolds, in Leveredge, near Berstall.
John Swallow, aged 37, late of Briestwhistle, near Wake- field, coal -miner.
John Bailey, aged 31, late of Thornhill, near Wakefield, clothier, &c.
Joseph Fisher, aged 33, late of Briestwhistle aforesaid, coal miner
The above three unhappy men were convicted (together with John Lamb, who was afterwards reprieved), of a burglary in the house of Samuel Moxon, of Upper Whitley, in the West Riding of the county of York. They went armed and in disguise to the said Samuel Moxon's house on the night of the 3rd of July last, and feloniously entered the place, and by threats of violence obtained several notes, some silver, a quantity of butter, and wearing apparel.
Job Hey, aged 40 ; John Hill, aged 36 ; and William Hartley, aged 41, were convicted of a burglary in stealing fire-arms in the night-time out of the house of Sir. George Haigh, of Copley Gate, in Skircote, near Elland, in the parish of Halifax, farmer. These men went to the said George Haigh's house armed with pistols, and, having by intimidation procured admittance, succeeded in obtaining by violence and threats a gun and a pistol, &c. While they were knocking at the door, Mr. Haigh got up, and standing upon the stair inquired, " Who's there? " The answer from without was — "Our master, General Ludd, has sent for your fire-arms " — they had got the gun and pistol. They said to his servant, " Tell your master that if he does not sell his milk in the neighbourhood at two pence per quart, they would visit him again on a similar purpose." The principal witness against them was an accomplice in the robbery. The pistol was found in the house of Job Hey, also three pounds and a quarter of gunpowder.
James Hey, aged 25.
Joseph Crowther, aged 31 ; and
Matthew Boyle, aged 46, were convicted of robbery, in the house of James Brook, of Fair Town, in the parish of Huddersfield, on the 29th day of November last, and stealing a one-pound note, a three-shilling piece, and putting the persons therein in bodily fear.
These three men were mere robbers, and do not appear to have any other object in view but the obtaining of plunder. In the course of the same night they plundered several other houses in the neighbourhood of Fair Town, in the said West Riding, and at the close of their wicked expedition shared the profits, amounting to £15 each.
James Haigh, aged 23, late of Dalton, clothier.
Jonathan Dean, aged 30, late of Huddersfield, cloth- dresser.
John Ogden, aged 28, late of the same place.
John Walker, aged 31, late of the same place ; and
Thomas Brook, aged 32, late of Lockwood, near Huddersfield. The five culprits, after a trial which lasted the whole day, were convicted on a statute of the 9th of George III., which made it a capital felony to demolish, or to begin to demolish, any mill of any description whatsoever. It appears that these deluded men, in company with George Mellor and William Thorp, who commanded on that of upwards of one hundred other persons, marched in military order and array, being armed with guns and pistols, axes, hammers, &c, such as are used for breaking stones on the highways, and attacked the mill of Mr. Cartwright, of Rawfolds (about six miles from Huddersfield), who used machinery obnoxious to the people employed in the dressing of cloth, and which they unhappily conceived to be destructive to their regular work. The attack was made on the night of the 11th of April last, and commenced with a discharge of guns and pistols. They were resisted with great spirit by Mr. Cartwright, and two of the assailantH were mortally wounded and died soon after. Great numbers of these misguided men were afterwards apprehended, but only eight were brought to trial. The above five were convicted, three acquitted, and the rest discharged by proclamation, or on bail.
The whole of the above unhappy men were truly penitent when they ascended the scaffold, and all joined in singing that beautiful hymn in the Wesleyan Hymn Book — " Behold the Saviour of mankind, &c.
