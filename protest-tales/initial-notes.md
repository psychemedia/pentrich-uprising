# Protest Tales


> "Protest Tales", a new set (currently in preparation) that brings together several separate tales of protest and revolt, from the Luddites of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, to the Blanketeers and the Pentrich Rising. One strand that weaves through the performance is place, as we hear different tales from the same locations (e.g. Pentrich, Huddersfield). Another relates to individuals who cross between the tales (a rebel, a newspaperman, a lawyer). A third relates to Special Proceedings and trials, with each of the different trial verdicts representing a moment of jeopardy and providing a regular beat point throughout the set.

WIP: a 1 hour festival set.

*I bring you a story,*  
*Of rebels and spies,*  

*I bring you a tale,*  
*Of protests and lies.*

Once, there was a kingdom. Its armies had been fighting wars in far off lands for many years.  It had been blockaded, unable to export the goods that paid for the wars, and hit by several poor harvests in a short few years. The King was troubled in mind and body, and they called him *mad*. His son, the Prince Regent, extravagant in taste, profligate in ,manner, a drinker and a philanderer, a *playboy*, acted in the King's stead. The land was in the midst of a revolution in industry, while most of the working populace were poor, really poor, poverty stricken, destitute, barely able even to afford bread. In the country, the working people were typically un-represented in a Parliament that created ever more capital crimes — crimes that would see you *hung* — in a feeble attempt to suppress dissent. In the country, there was a sense of revolt.

Once, is a little over two hundred years ago. The Kingdom is England. There is a saying amongst storytellers that the story is what's left when the facts are forgotten. The stories I bring you are stories I learned from the newspapers of the time, and the "past times" memorial columns of  a generation, fifty years or so, later. The sort of news stories you might have read, or heard second hand, and perhaps recalled years later. The sort of story that is common knowledge at the time, and folk memory thereafter.

I originally come from Huddersfield, the setting for some of the stories I will tell you. Whilst I don't remember any particular tale being told of the Luddites as I grew up — I don't remember "doing" the Luddites at school, or being told family stories about them — somehow, somehow, I have always known about the Luddites. Steeped in the landscape, the soot black stained houses and mills, the ghosts of those times somehow imprinted themselves in me.

So with that, let the stories begin.

START AT THE END, THEN FINISH THE END AT THE END: It's 1817. Nottingham. N men are tried for High Treason, accused that on the night of ?? they did.... [Pentridge uprsiing]

How did it come to this?

Let's go further back. To 1811, Pentrich, Derbyshire, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham.
