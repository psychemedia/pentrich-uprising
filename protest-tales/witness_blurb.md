__Jonathan Womersley, a clock-maker at Huddersfield.__

I saw George Mellor on the evening on which Mr. Horsfall was shot, about six o'clock or a quarter or ten minutes after, at the corner of the Cloth-Hall-street in Huddersfield; that they went to Mr. Tavenor's, to settle a little account, where they had one pint, and then a second; he stopped till he got his money, and then he left Mellor there, and then he went to the Brown Cow in the market-place, and the soldiers were then riding over the market-place, full speed. I suppose, upon the alarm of this person having been shot, the soldiers had been ordered out; that has not been proved, but I suppose that is what is to be understood. He says that he saw him about six, or a little after that time. According to the account of his cousin, he was at Dungeon Bottom at a quarter after six. They may all think that they speak accurately, but still it shews the little reliance which can be placed upon evidence as to particular times, when you come to be bringing several transactions within the space of pretty nearly an hour. Mrs. Mellor says that they stopped a quarter of an hour; so that according to her account, Mellor did not leave her house till half after six.

I was at Huddersfield and at Tavenor's at the time the other man speaks to; I confirm his account: we had two pints of beer, and remained in company till we'd drank it. I think we stayed half-an-hour at Tavenor's, it might be more or less.

__John Thorpe of Huddersfield.__ 

I know George Mellor; I remember the day Mr. Horsfall was shot: I met George Mellor opposite the George Inn in Huddersfield, about ten minutes before six o'clock; I stopped in the street with him a few minutes; I know it was just short of ten minutes to six, because I had a watch I wanted to sell him, and he asked him if he would buy it; he took the watch out, and that's how I know it was ten minutes before six.

I saw Mr. Horsfall on the evening when he was shot, shortly after five o'clock, going up the street towards the Market-place, I went into my own house, and drank tea, then put on me coat, and went up the street about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Horsfall had got on horseback, so about half past five; I went across the Market-place and met George Mellor coming towards the George Inn; we passed a few words, and were only together a minute or two before I went back home. It wasn't quite six o'clock when I left George Mellor, and I didn't hear of Mr. Horsfall's being shot till after I'd got home.

__Frances Midwood (young woman)__

I live with my father at Longroyd Bridge. I recollect that that day we were to wash the *next* day, so I was fetching water from the raising-shop of Mr. Fisher, for washing the next day. I began going about five o'clock, and the first time I went there was nobody there; but when I went about ten minutes after five, William Thorpe was there, and again the third time William Thorpe was there, talking with another man, but I didn't know him; I went repeatedly, and continued going until I heard some report about Mr. Horsfall being shot; and then I didn't fetch any more water, but that every time I went to the raising-shop, after the first, I saw Thorpe there; and that one of the times I was there I saw Abraham Pilling, who had been making me a pair of shoes, and he'd followed me in to the shop, when he saw me go in.


__Abraham Pilling, a shoemaker in Huddersfield.__

I had made a pair of shoes for the last witness, Frances Midwood; I delivered them to her on the night Mr. Horsfall was shot; I was going to her father's with them, and saw her crossing the road with a can, then I followed her into the raising-house, where I found her and William Thorpe; she was lading water out of a cistern with a can; it was just short of a quarter to six when I set out from home, and Longroyd Bridge is better than a mile from my house. So it must have been past six o'clock probably before I got there. Frances Midwood took the shoes, and asked me what was to pay, and she went to fetch the money to pay me; and in the meantime I talked with Thorpe, and then she came back with a note. I stayed a little while longer, and then went forward a mile another way, where I was going, and as I was going out of the raising-house, the neighbours told me that Mr. Horsfall had been shot.
