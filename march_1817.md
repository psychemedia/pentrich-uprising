Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 11 March 1817

The Manchester Mercury, Tuesday, March 11, 1817.

The lenient moderation of the magistracy has at length eked out the fullest extent of forbearance compatible with the protection which is due to the persons and property of the peaceable and well-disposed part of the community. We find it was among the notifications at the meeting on the 3d inst. near St. Peter's Church, corroborated, in the course of last week, by the declarations individuals who have been actively engaged in promoting the late seditious meetings, that the espousers of their doctrines should collect at the same place the Monday following (yesterday), and proceed to the Metropolis, at nine o'clock, to present a petition to the Prince Regent, that they might be enabled *"to undeceive him ! "* Aware of these intentions, and of the dangers which an immense influx of strangers, irritated by the inflammatory appeals of their factious leaders, (who, under the pretence of promoting Parliamentary Reform, have been for a length of time agitating the minds of the labouring class of society), portended, the conservators ofthe public tranquillity took every precaution adequate to the occasion.

Yesterday morning, according to the expectations entertained, crowds of people flocked into town from all directions, as early as eight o'clock, and at about nine, the instigators appeared on their temporary stage in cart, and continued to harangue the multitude till their vast increasing numbers suggested the expediency of putting into practice the well-formed arrangements of the civil and military powers. Accordingly, a party of the first Regiment of Dragoons, under Colonel Teesdale, accompanied by the Magistrates of the District, appeared amongst them, and with adroitness and decision almost electrical, surrounded tbe erection, and immediately conveyed the entire group upon it to the New Bayley Prison ; their attention was next directed to the concourse of auditors, who were forthwith dispersed, without the infliction of any severity.

An arrest had taken place early on Sunday morning, of Johnson and Ogden, who had previously figured at this place, and they were secured in the New Bayley. Others were seized by the soldiers on their way to deliver their charge in Salford. The following are the names of prisoners : Drummond, Baguley, (the two orators), Handring, Grimshaw, Lingard, Quiney, Shaw, Wood, Hargraves, Lever, Shawcross, two Williamses, Tucker, Whitworth, Oddey, Bousfield, Kay, Lefgar, Blackshaw, Simms, Thomason, Barlow, Cuthbird, Lees, Hudson, and Higginbotham, (the owner of the cart on which the stage was fixed).

A considerable number of people set out on their mission to London, taking the route of Stockport, but about forty of them were reconducted to Manchester, and added to their other unfortunate companions; others were furnished secure accommodations in Stockport. Most of them were provided with knapsacks, &c. containing blankets and other articles. Upon the examination of some of these travelling equipages, two unusually large knives were discovered.

Johnston, Ogden, &c. will be dispatched, without loss of time, under escort, to the Secretary of State, in London.

We shall desist from entering further at present into the cases of there characters, as they will probably hereafter be the subject High Judicial Enquiry.

The military preparations were under the direction of Sir John Byng, the commander of the district, who arrived in Manchester on Sunday. A party of the Regiment of Foot were present to render their assistance.

We may fairly presume that at one period there was an assemblage of at least thirty thousand at the meeting ; and believe we not over-rate the arrivals in the course of the day at from sixty to seventy thousand individuals.

No particular act of outrage or intemperance has yet reached our ears, and we cannot help feeling highly indebted to the judicious and salutary interposition of the respective authorities for the satisfatory result of this day's transactions. As we are closing this account, we have authority to state, that the apprehensions are nothing short of *two hundred* persons.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 15 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 11.

After the meeting of the Reformers broke up on Monday the 3rd inst. we heard amongst a variety of reports as to the result of their deliberations, a vague indistinct story of a motion to meet again on the following Monday (yesterday), prepared with blankets to proceed to London, to lay their sufferings and their petitions before the Prince Regent, whom it seems, they (all or other) professed to hold in high respect and veneration, whilst the most vile and approbious epithets were levelled at his Mnisters. During the week, the blanket story gained ground; and a report of sixty thousand Scottish Reformers being on their way towards London, and that they had even advanced as far as Preston, was prevalent; whilst accounts of individual preparation tor the intended march, continually met the ear. There were many persons, however, who did not put any faith in the "often told tale" till Saturday last, when a placard of which the following is a copy, was exhibited on the walls of this town and its neighbourhood:—

"PUBLIC MEETING

"The Inhabitants of MANCHESTER and its vicinity are respectfully informed that a PUBLIC MEETING regarding to adjournement, will be held near St Peter's Church on Monday morning the 10th of March 1817, when it is hoped that every person who is determined to carry his Petition to London, will assemble peaceably and orderly, and provide himself with the necessary means of support requisite to bear him through this loyal and necessary undertaking.

"It is hoped that these friends of Parliamentary Reform, who possess the means, will come forward on this important occasion.

"Persons will be appointed to receive contributions this evening at New Islington, and at the meeting on Monday. W OGDEN, Printer, 28 Wood Street."

Still we should have been sceptical in respect of the report of the intention of the intamated people to proceed to London and should have thought the foregoing placard the result of a determination of some one to laugh at credulity, if it had not been the imprint of a person who had distinguished himself on the cart at all the preceding meetings, by haranguing the gaping gulls who surroundd the temporary alter of sedition. His oratorical labours are however suspended but early on Sunday morning, he was arrested in his bed, and conveyed to the New Bailey Prison, nearly at the same time with one Johnstone, a tailor (the Missionary who was dispatched by the Lancashire Reformers to convert the Staffordshire Potters to the new political faith); who we are told, has distinguished himself in this neighbourhood for several months past, as one of the most violent of demagogues who have endeavoured to make the working classes subservient to the too evident design of disorganizing society, and destroying the Constitution.

That many persons, willing to labour, have lately wanted employment. we believe: and that of this description some would be found at poltical meetings; but we also believe, that by far a greater number who are too idle for labour for their bread and who wish for an easier, or rather more luxurious life, swelled their numbers. Both these descriptions are able to be misled by designing orators; and are easily hurried on by the impulsive stream, put in motion by the bad spirits who join mobs of all kinds, in the hope that the consequent bustle will afford opportunity for the exercise of their callings, to plunder, to rob and to murder. Such men are ready to *practice*, and by example, instruct others to practice the doctrine, which the mouth pieces of such meetings *recommend*. They labour for the equalization of property; and like the vultures who hover over contending armies in the hope of a gluttonous feast on the fallen carcases, they look forward to the glorious time of anarchy, which they anticipate as the reward their present patient attendance on the labour of excitement. Mixed in the crowd, they second the views of the designing men, who, under the plausible pretence of helping the poor and the ignorant to their rights, make them pay for their own undoing. That the poison thus poured into the minds of the unthinking has begun to operate is too evident, whenever a decently dressed person, walking out, finds himself in the vicinity of the lower orders of society. The remarks addressed *at*, if not *to* him — as to the sources of his prosperity - that it was the result of the labour of the poor—that all would come round again soon—that it will be their turn next! &c &c. prove the operation of the deleterious principles which have been poured into the ears of the working classes of society. A Reform in Parliament is but a cry at the present time, used by many to hide the deep design of general devastation. To ignorance, to idleness, and improvidence, the doctrine of the Spenceans, by whatever name it is called, has great charms. No wonder it has many votaries. Men acting under such influence  are easily persuaded that the richer part of society are enjoying the fruits of the labour of the poor; that their rulers are their oppressors; and that the wholesome laws of restriction which Parliament, with paternal care, has enacted are acts of tyranny. Can it then be wondered at, that designing men should find tools to work with?

By the placard which we have quoted, it will be seen that a preparatory meeting, for levying pecuniary means to carry the resolution of last Monday into execution was held on Saturday evening at New Islington, Salford and we understand that other preparatory meetings were held yesterday morning, very early, at Middleton, Oldham &c. to instruct men (so systematic are the proceedings of organized disaffection) as to their conduct at the Manchester meeting, on their proposed march to London, and their junction with their brother reformers in Spa-fields.

A crowd began to gather on the ground in front of the Quaker's Meeting-house, before nine o'clock yesterday morning, and a table, elevated on a cart, was used by a person to write a register of the names of the poor, infatuated wretches who declared their intention to proceed to London, and to receive money, subscribed by the less zealous, or more infirm votaries of delusion, in aid of the volunteers. At half-past nine the number of persons on the ground amounted to at least ten thousand `[One of the Manchester papers says from 25 to 30,000 
]`, soon after which, a leader of the multitude (whose name we could not learn) came to the field in a hackney-coach out of which he stepped and mounted the cart. He was received with huzzas; but we were pleased to observe, that, the cheers did not proceed from the bulk of the assembly, and only from a few of the more insane (not amounting to more than three or four hundred at the most) who held up and waved their hats.

The greatest praise is due to the care and foresight of the Magistrates and the Boroughreeves and Constables of Manchester and Salford for the precautionary steps thev took. A great number of additional constables had been sworn in, and soon after ten o'clock they proceeded to the neighbourhood of the meeting, from whence about a thousand men, provided with blankets and such provision as they could make, had withdrawn a short time before, to Piccadilly, from whence they set out, soon after on the mad scheme of marching to London. A little before eleven o'clock, whilst the Orators were displaying their eloquence in the brick-field, using the most inflammatory language on the one hand, and the greatest persuasion on, the other, to induce the silly people who surrounded the cart to contribute bountifully towards defraying the expences of the blanketeers during their expedition, the preparation of the legal authorities was complete, and the Magistrates, the Municipal Officers, and the Special Constables, and four troops of cavalry from the barracks, (under the direction of Sir John Byng, the Commander of the District) simultaneously, by a most happy execution of the prepared design, surrounded the seditious hustings, and took all the orators and their papers into custody. Amongst the former was a man of the name of Drummond, provided with a new great coat &c. to head the column of petitioners who had just before left the ground, and another leader of the name of Baguley. The sweep was instantaneously compleated and the exciters to mischief were immediately marched away, prisoners, under a strong escort, to the New Bailey Prison. Whilst the crowd gave way to apprehensions for personal safety, and dispersed, a detachment of the peace officers, under the direction of*Magistrates who accompanied them*, immediately after the ringleaders were secured, led a troop of cavalry after the migratory reformers, who had set out on their way to London, in the expectation of being overtaken very soon by their leaders, bringing with them the money which infatuation had subscribed (we understand to a considerable amount) on the field. The stragglers were overtaken, and many were secured before they had arrived at Longsight; but at Stockport Bridge, the cavalry surrounded a great number, all furnished for bivouacing— and some, if the knives found in their knapsacks indicated any thing, for other purposes, who were made prisoners. Upwards of two hundred were brought to New Bailey Prison in the afternoon.

Before we close the account of the proceedings of the day, it is a duty to state, that a detachment of the 54th regiment of foot was under arms, in the vicinity of the meeting, but were not called upon to act; and that the Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry were under arms all day in various parts of that county and a detachment of several troops, evinced their zeal, and entitled them to the thanks of their country, by their services in Manchester, where they volunteered their assistance; many of them having marched at least thirty miles yesterday for that purpose.In the course of the day, a part of the 55th regiment of foot marched into town, but we are happy to state that there is no appearance of there being any necessity for any thing more than the impression of their presence. In the course of the evening, Johnstone, Ogden, Baguley and Drummond, who were, we understand, arrested by virtue of warrants from the Secretary of State's Office, were, we believe, sent off under a proper guard to London. The town is now at peace and free from alarm.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 22 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 18.

A number of the designing or deluded persons about Manchester have been apprehended and conveyed to the Castle of Chester, in addition to those mentioned apprehended last week and committed to the New Bailey, Manchester. They were apprehended at Heaton Norris, and are charged in the commitment with treasonable and seditious practices. They appeared to be a wretched set of individuals, and two of them mere youths. The Chester papers state that Pike-heads, and numbers of heavy sticks, containing a kind of daggers, about eight inches long, have been found at Stockport. Several of the deluded men were cut in the face in opposing the cavalry. The Blanketeers are represented to have made a very ludicrous appearance; many them having their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders en militaire. Many of them swam several rivers elude the civil and military power waiting at bridges to intercept them.

A Manchester paper Tuesday says, " the number of unfortunate objects confined in our prison exceeded 250, of whom 120 have been examined by W.D. Evans Esq. and of whom 40 have been discharged, and 80 committed for want of securities."

It is a well known fact, that *Evening Meetings* have been held for a long time past, at least twice a week, to which persons have been admitted indiscriminately, in a large old Spinning Factory, at New Islington, Ancoats. A room in it in it, capable of holding thousands of persons, with a rostrum in the centre, has been frequently filled. During the last week these assemblies have been held every night, to engage the deluded in this wild but dangerous enterprise of marching to London with petitions, and to collect contributions for the purpose. Leaders of tens, fifties, &c. were appointed, and every tenth man was to be the bearer of a petition.

These petitions, it appears, were not only of one import, but (numerous they were, one to every ten Political Pilgrims) were *exactly the same*, being copied from a prepared form, printed for the purpose by Ogden. Many these petitions, fairly engrossed, (but many instances only signded by one person, and in several *without a single signature*,) were found in the hands of the leaders of the march.

From the*Macclesfield Courier* we learn, that that town and neighbourhood, were thrown into a state of great alarm so early as Saturday the 8th inst. by the prevalent report that "10,000 Scotsmen, clothed in plaid," had entered Manchester, with the certainty of being joined about 40,000 Lancashire men.

On Wednesday, another arrest took place, by virtue of a warrant sent down from the Secretary of State's Office, when Elijah Dixon, a cotton spinner, was taken at work, in Manchester, where he was in the habit of earning considerable weekly wages. He was sent off to London the same evening, under the conduct of a Police Officer; and on Friday delivered up to the custody of the keeper of one of the London Bridewells, previous to his examination.

"Combination has led to Conspiracy, Conspiracy to Treason against the State ; and had it not been tor the wise, forbearing vigilance of our Magistrates, seconded by the active care of our Police, scenes of misry might have occurred in this populous district and elsewhere, which cannot be imagined but with horror. It is a circumstance not altogether conjectural, that at given points on their approach to the capital, arms and ammunition were expected to be prepared for them.— The facility too with which contributions have been levied and obtained for these unworthy purposes is truly astonishing, if the nature of the times and the cry of misery which has been prevalent be taken into consideration." —*Manch. Chron.*

This altair shows the wisdom and necessity of the late proceedings in parliament, by which government has been armed with extraordinary powers to counteract the designs of faction. If any before doubted whether a case sufficiently strong had been made out, it can scarcely be doubted now. If the organization of the disaffected societies was so complete, and the delusion spread through the disaffected classes so extensive, that, at the appointment of a few desperate characters, a mob of 50or 60,000 persons could be drawn together to one place, at a given time, and the greater part so devoted to their instigators, as to be ready to engage in any project, however mischievous and insane, which they might direct, as, for instance, to march in a body to London, to throw the country into disorder throughouttheir march, and to live on free quarters on the inhabitants, (the only means they had of subsistence,) than was it high time for the country to call for additional protection, and for parliament to grant it. What can those delectabie politicians in the abstract, who have enamoured against a standing army in time of peace, say ? Was the civil power equal to such an emergence ? If, when regular troops, and others of the military are at hand, such bold attempts are made at disorder, what must have been our condition had the army been disbanded, and that arm of our defence cut off by the knife of retrenchment? The folly of those who are ever declaiming on abstract rights and ?? [desires?], without any regard to what is fit and practicable, is sufficiently evident; and it is pitiable, and marks the infirmity of many acute minds; but there is a numerous class, who know what they mean when they reiterate the arguments and declamations of persons, who, though they do much mischief, do not, in truth, design it. The straight forward men clamour against taxation, because they wish to get rid of the army, and they wish the army disbanded, becuase it is an inconvenient obstruction to the operation of reforming mobs. They have the same objection to the civil power being strengthened ; they have bawled with all their breath against the swearing in of special constables, and have held the measure up, in the words of a notable oracle of the faction, as "a conspiracy against the liberties and rights of the people;" and why ? They wish to mob without control, and to revolutionize without check.—*Liverpool Courier.*

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 01 April 1817

The Blanketeers' Petition.

The following it a copy of the Petition which Malcontents were to carry forward to the Prince Regent, from the press of tbe State Prisoner Odden:—

THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED, INHABITANTS MANCHESTER,IN THE COUNTV OF LANCASTER,

*Humbly Sheweth,*

" That your Petitioners, before the last war, neither felt nor feared either difficulties or privations; but during the continuance have frequently experienced both, and have repeatedly applied to your Royal Father, your Royal Highness, and the House of Commons, for redress, which applications, we are sorry to say, have in our humble, but firm, belief, not received that attention which their importance merited; so that now, when the waste of war is over, our sufferings are become both more general and deeper than ever.

" This state of things, we, your Petitioners, attribute to the rapid increase of taxation, which has been quadrupled, together with the increase of rent, which has probably, been doubled during the war; which, tohether so nearly absorb the whole produce of the kingdom, as to leave a quantity very far short of being sufficient to keep your Petitioners in existence, and therefore their lives are now become a burden and a plague to them ; your distressed Petitioners are further convinced, that if the House of Commons had really emanated from, and been wholly and annually appointed by, the People at large, this war, and the taxation resulting therefrom, would long ago have received a sufficient check, even admitting the nation have sanctioned its commencement— that the laws to regulate the importation of corn, calculated to advance its price, would never have been suffered to pass—that the law of libel, which subjects the publishers of truth in some instances to great pains and penalties, thereby preventing the publication of the most important truths, could never have received the sanction of the friends of truth and mankind— that a Bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, a Bill empowering Ministers to imprison, without proof of guilt, whomsoever they please, and for an unknown length time—could never have passed.

"Your Petititioners therefore humbly, but fervently, pray, that your Highness will instantly dismiss from your Councils all those Ministers who have advised or devised such cruel, such unjust measures, and call to your Councils even who are the declared or avowed friends to conciliatory measures—to Parliamenetary Reform— and a general and very considerableretrenchment in every part of national expenditure. Our lives are in your hans—our happiness, in great measure, depends on you. °If you procure the adoption of measures calculated to relieve us, you may then safely rely upon our support and gratitude°— WITHOUT THIS< WE CAN NEITHER SUPPORT YOU NOR OURSELVES. Your gracious attention to our prayers will gain you eternal esteem and gratitude of your Petitioners, who will ever pray."

The Scotsman - Saturday 12 April 1817

The following Circular has been issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department .

( COPY)— Circular— *Whitehall , March* 27 . 1817 .

My Lord , —As it is of the greatest importance to prevent as far as possible the circulation of Blasphemous and Seditious Pamphlets and Writings, of which, for a considerable time past, great numbers have been sold and distributed throughout the country; I have thought it my duty to consult the Law Officers of the Crown, whether an individual found selling, or in any way publishing such Pamphlets or Writings might be brought immediately before a Justice of the Peace, under a warrant issued for the purpose, to answer for his conduct. The Officers having accordingly taken this matter into their consideration, have notified to me their opinion, That a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged before him upon oath, with the publication of Libels of the nature in question, and compel him to give bail to answer the charge. Under these circumstances, I beg leave to call your Lordship's attention very particularly to this subject; and I have to request, that if your Lordship should not propose to attend in person at the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden in and for the county under your Lordship's charge, you would make known to the Chairman of such Sessions the substance of this communication, in order that he may recommend to the several Magistrates to act thereupon in all cases where any person should be found offending against the law in the manner above mentioned. I beg leave to add, that persons vending Pamphlets or other Publications, in the manner alluded to, should be considered as coining under the provisions of the Hawker's and Pedlar's Act, and be dealt with accordingly, unless they shew that they are furnished, with a License, as required by the said Act. I am, &c. SIDMOUTH.

To his Majesty's Lieutenant in the county of _____.

[TH: we might also note further down the page, the following report: *By accounts received from Leicester we learn that eight of the Luddites, tried at that town , have_been capitally convicted , and received sentence of death . A ninth ( JOHN SLATER ) has been convicted under the Frame-breaking Act , and sentenced to transportation for life . The tenth was seized with convulsion fits during his trial , and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence , was remanded to prison .*]

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Sunday 04 May 1817

LORD SIDMOUTH'S CIRCULAR.

OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN, REFERRED TO IN THE CIRCULAR LETTER FROM VISCOUNT SIDHOUTH TO HIS MAJESTY’S LIEUTENANTS OF COUNTIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, DATED MARCH 27, 1817.

We are of opinicm that a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party charged on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice Of the Peace. With respect to the Secretary of-State, in the case of Entick v. Carrington, reported by Mr. Hargrave, though the Court were of opinion the warrants which were then the subject of discussion were illegal, yet Lord Camden declared, and in which he stated the other Judges agreed with him, that they were bound to adhere to the determination of the Queen v. Derby, and the King v. Earbury ;in both of which cases it had been holden, that it was competent to the Secretary of State to issue a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with a scandalous and seditious libel; and that they, the Judges, had no right to overturn those decisions.

With respect to the power of a Judge to issue such warrant, it appears us, that at all events, under the statute of the 48th Geo. III. ch. 58, a Judge has such power, upon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that act; a Judge would probably expect that it should appear to be the intention of the Attorney-General to file Information against the person charged.

With respect to a Justice of the Peace, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Mr. Wilkes's libels only amounts to this—that libel is not such an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his Privilege of Parliament, or to warrant the demanding sureties of the peace from the defendant: but there is no decision or opinion that a Justice of the Peace might not apprehend any person not privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge. It has certainly been the opinion of one of our most learned predecessors that such warrants may be issued and acted upon by Justices of the Peace, as appears by the cases of Thomas Spence and Alexander Hogg in the year 1801. We agree in that opinion, and therefore think that a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information on oath with the publication of a scandalous and seditious libel, and compel him to give bail to answer such charge. W. GARROW. S. SHEPHERD.  Lincoln-Inn, Feb. 24, 1817.

IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT

HOUSE OF LORDS

*Monday May 12th*

CIRCULAR LETTER OF VISCOUNT SIDMOUTH.

Earl GREY rose to bring forward his promised motion relative to this subject. He had to request the most serious attention of their Lordships to what would transpire in the discussion, as it may constitute the foundaion of some future proposition to be submitted. It appeared, that under this new practice, for such he must call it, being unsupported by any previous authority, a Justice of the Peace was empowered to send any man to gaol upon a charge of publishing a blasphemous or seditious libel, unless he procured bail. Now what said the opinion of the Law Officers referred to ? " That a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party cliarired on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice of the Peace. " With regard to the power of a Secretary of State to issue warrants, that had been so well established by the decisions of Courts, that he did not now intend to dispute it. Whether it was originally an usurpation or not, it had been establislied by coinpctciit legal authorities. The opinion proceedcd to state ( and h had a right to presume that a Judge had no such power at common law, as it was not stated in the opinion ), " that, at all events, under the Statute of the 48th of George the Third ; chapter 58, a Judge has such a power, upuon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that Act, a Judge would probably expert that it should appear to be the intention of th Attrney-Genaral to file an informaion against the prson charged." 

 He ;' iiiprehmded ' the true construction of the Act to be ; that there must be an affidavit or certificate of an informaiton filed, before the Judge could " riliit ' n ' warri ' llir ; the ' op. iri'ion then went oil to refer to ilie case of Mr.. Wilkcs, and to state tlial the decision in that case amounts only to this,, «• that libel is not slieli an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his privilege of Parliament, or ID warrant the deiiiaiidiri ^ sureties ol ' fiic peace from the defendant ; lint tlicrulis no dccjsiuli or cpiliiiin lhat a Justice of the Peace miqht lint ai ) p ' re !] ciid a person not so privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge ; " ' the necrs'jJrv eli'ect of sitcl ' i • • in " opinion iniibl lie to give to every Justice of the Peace in the kingdom the power of holding to bail any person, or of depriving such person of his liberty, for aily publication • ivli. itc \ cr which that Justice might, in his opinion, dcein a libel. And this was not confined to blasphemous or seditious libels, to tlir former ofwiiicli (. the opinion did not allude, but it applied to all libels, private or public , whether deemed hc. iinlalousdriniilieion. ', or blasphemous or seditious. In any ciisu in which a Justice of the Peace deemed n libel to have been published, he was to be a. '. illu ' risi'rt to hold the parly lo biiil. To justify this opinion, the Law Officers referred to the opinion of n. learned predece'. hor of theirs. He could not, however, after the most paiient uivcsti ;; ation, discover any authority upon which the diuinn i : owset ui ) ill the opinion and the Circular could be supported. An tho -Noble Earl proceeded in liis di '. cns. sioii, lie reft '.

Even from the opinion relei red to itself, it appeared that, previously to the Bil of tllf King, tlibrc were strong doubts as to the existence of such a legal power even in a Judge. He felt Wili-nuued in couteiliiing tliilt the net ill ( iiifslion did nut {. ivc Midi a power.

 ruction of the passage, to contend that the offemce of libel was comprehended in its meanng; and, from the context, he maintained that the opinion of Mr Serjeant Hawkins was decidedly against the legality of any such power in a Magistrate as that in question.— " l ' ' ur, " addcil lifi Bpl.

Il nnisl have beon to iciililie ), therefore, that Lord Chief Justice ir. ilc adverted : mid liic piis'ai ^ c in queslioil conld not lesitinintely receive that extensive construction which suinc might wisli to mve it. But in the second volume of his wor !; s, Lord Chief Justice Tliilc spoke niciru distinctly on the subject. His statement was, " A Justice of the Peace has the power to grant a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with felony or breach of the peace, although lidt indicted. " In support of this opinion thu Lord Chief Justice Ilalc cited, many discs to prove the legality of this power in cases ot felony and breaches of the peace, hut in no other cases. He confined himself specifically and distinctly to felonies and breaches of the peace, and did not utter a word beyond these?? cases. Such appeared to be the limit of the ^ Iag ' state's authority. There was nothing here to support the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crowu, " that a Justice of the Peace might issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information, on oath, with the publication of scanilalpus ;> and seditious libel, and to compel liiin to give bail to answer to such charge. " The utmost that could be made of the c ; u'c by human ingenuity would be, to leave the matter in some degree of doubt ; although, for Jiiiiimelt ; lie declared he had no doubt whatever rei. iiccting it. lint admitting that it was doubtful, it was certainly not a case which a Secretary of State, on the authority of the Law Officers of the Crown, was warrated ill recoinniciiding ^ o the general adoption of the Magistrates throughout the kingdom. The Noble Lord dwelt with most force and qt geatest len ' s di on Hie consideration of the celebrated proceed • irr'swiiiclltoukpiacc before Lord C. undeii, in the case of Mr. '\ Vilk <; s ; The, decision of that most learned and revered Lawyer was, he contended, ill support of what he advanced, though the case respected a warrant of the Secretary of State. " The authority of Lord Mansfield also, in certain cases to which he referred, was In furtherance of this argument.. Ill this part of the discussion, the Noble Earl distinguished between the powers vested legally and constitutionally in a Secretary of State, and those lodged in an ordinary Justice of the Peace ; and seemed to admit, that in the former those powers were vested, which were nowassum' ' d to be vested in the superior Magistrate : and he descanted on the dilliciilty hi legally deciding upon cases of libel which were endeavoured to be snnplilied and defined by the admirable Bill of a late. Right Hon. Friend, of his ( Mr Pox ), the greatest, lawyer ol ' an uiicdu. cat. ed. 'inaii. he ever, knew, and, which was most ably supported by his Noble Friend ( Lord Erskine ) then present ; and he adjured tlhe lioiiEeHot to lend its sanction to a new and anomalous power in the law, so dangerous to individuals, and eventually dangerous to the State. itself. -. The opinions given by the law" servants dt' the Crown could not, he thougt, be without some degree of bias on their minds, and those opinions ought to be appreciated by their Lordships. Independent of the objectionable considerations in a legal view of the case, such an interference- on the part of the Executive Government to influence the administration of justice, ought seriously to be deprecated. The whole presentcd a case of a dangerous and nncdntt ; tutipnal nature ; and in deciding. upon it their Lordships should seriously consider its probable consequences, either with a view to the liveiitual effect it might have on the conduct of the people on the one hand, or on tlic other in strengthening -the overgrown power of the Government, so as to create a power in its hands not a little participatine ; of the cjharacer of a military, ' despotism. After ' apologising to the House for his long letentioil, 'the Noble Lord closed a short but eloquent peroration, by moving, " That a Copy of the Ciise, upon which the opinion of his Majesty's Law Officer. », referred to in the Circular Letter, of Viscount Sidmouth, was given, be laid before the House. " '. ' " Lord Ellenborough said, no person doubted that a person guilty of vending such publications as could tend to iiitliune tiro public mind, should be held responsible for them. ^ the custom of the Attorney-General on th last day of every term, in moving ima continuation ol ' recognisances, justified what he was now saying. Indeed, from the very nature of the crsc, he was fully satisfied that Magistrates had the powers now assigned them ; and hiTact the country would be placed in a truly miserable, situation, were siicli not tl. i ' e case. If this was not the law of the country, it would be impossible for the Courts Of Law to proceed. il ). business ; and lie iniliit. l ) cg- ' leave to add, that it would be impolitic in their Lordships to adjourn a single day without taking 'oiiie steps to make this a law. i He. noiy. held in his hand nil extract »! ' the diitcs of recognisances which had been entered into on this subject, by which it had been held that persons might be put to bail for libels, before indictments were found or even filed agaipst them. The Attorney-General's Lecliiiicre and North, > S ; c. hart done so ; and the uniform practice of the Courts had shewn the authority and rectitude lit such proceedings.: In tlic case of. ii conspiracy, he must confess he •. lioiild, without doubt, liold the person liable to hail. He lind never linird it disputed that Magistrates could hold to bail, and he believed this lind been ( be understood practice from the era of the Revolution. No individual, he believed, could have more regret than himself at si'eing : nii individual unnecessarily exorcised by law, but still he saw no reason why a person should be screened from the cll ' ccts of his delinquency. On the whole his Lordship, considering the Magistracy had the power which this circular letter supposed them to have, declared that he was decidedly prepared to give his vote accordingly.

Earl Grey's motion having been ably supported by Lords ERSKINE and HOLLAND, and opposed by the Lord CHANCLLOR and Viscount SIDMOUTH, was, on a division, negatived by a majority of S8.

Adjourned.
