# The Blanketeers and the Seditious Meetings Bill

The following is a version of the Blanketeers' story told in the style of a traditional fairy tale, and based on the principle that the story is what's left when the facts have been forgotten. I'm not sure whether it works, but I thought I'd give it a go...

> Once, there was a King; a *mad* King; the King was so infirm that his son, the Prince, ruled in his place; but the prince like to drink, and the prince was profligate, and the prince was a philanderer. In short, the prince was a full time playboy. And so, the King's Ministers ran the country instead.
>
> For a long time, the kingdom had been fighting many wars, and even though the wars were over now, the people were still very poor. And their discontent lead to angry mobs and riots.
>
> Although the country had laws, the Ministers were fearful of revolt, so they did all they could to make it easier to arrest people first, and ask questions later.
>
> This did not go down well with common people in the kingdom.
>
> Far away from the city where the King and Prince lived, along with all the Ministers, but still within the kingdom, was another city. To walk from one to the other could take a week or more to walk — this is once, remember, and not everyone had a horse — and that was if you were a good walker.
>
> One day, the people in the second city heard that a great mass of barbarians from the wastelands of the North were on a long march to the capital to complain to the King — or the Prince, or the Ministers, or to anyone who would listen, about how downtrodden they were.
>
> There wasn't really any barbarian hoard, but it got the people thinking. Maybe they could petition the Prince about the taxes they had to pay, the poor wages they received, the dire poverty in which they lived. Maybe they could persuade him to stop the Ministers taking the law into their own hands (they knew the King was mad, so it was pointless going to see him). And maybe they could lobby him for a Parliament that represented the common people, "them that hasn't", rather than the Lords and Ladies and just "them that has".
>
> So they had a meeting, and some of the men stood on a cart and gave a rousing speech to the crowd. And they decided they would march to the city where the Prince lived, up to a week's walk away, to petition him.
>
> Now the people knew that the Ministers had no love for the poor people, and nor did the local Magistrates, dirty smelly rabble that they were — the people, that is, not the Magistrates: they probably smelled beautiful and probably had a bath at last once a month — and they knew that the soldiers would be set on them if they looked like a mob.
>
> So they were clever; they would gathered together in small groups of ten people or so, with a separate copy of the petition for each group, or even each person, even if that meant each petition only had a few names on it, or even just one name on it, and they would march in small groups, because nobody could argue with that.
>
> Because the journey was long one, they would each take a blanket, to keep them warm at night as they'd have to camp under the stars; the one with petitions would pin them to the blanket, as a badge, to show their intention; and everyone who wasn't going on the march would raise what little money they could so the marchers could buy some small amount of food each day.
>
> So one morning, the people began to gather; thousands of them; a thousand or so set off on the march, "their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders" as if they were soldiers, and leaving the rest to their speeches and fundraising.
>
> As emotions started to get heated in the crowd, in came the army, and arrested the ringleaders.
>
> And then they went after the marchers, who were expecting their leaders to catch up with them later that day with the money to support them.
>
> (As it was, I've heard it tell that the purseman with a pretty penny in funds to pay for food and accommodation along the way got lost himself, and only returned when all the money had been spent!)
>
> The soldiers came along on their horses, with swords and sabers and who knows what, and the marchers — well, a blanket didn't work so well as armour, so it's not hard to work out who came off worst.
>
> Some of the marchers were split up and sent this way, others were sent that way, and several hundred found themselves in jail for the night.
>
> The leaders of the march were given special treatment, imprisoned, and given a day in court. Their witnesses were made ready, and then: nothing; back to prison they went.
>
> The Ministers reacted in style, pushing through a law that banned unapproved gatherings of more than fifty people
>
> Several weeks later, a Special Jury was laid on. But when the time came to present the case before the Judge, on charges that included "begging", because the marchers hadn't actually done anything wrong — they had broken no law, and this was a land that was supposedly ruled by law — the lawyer for the proscution just muttered something about it all being peaceful now, and there was no need to charge the men, so he wouldn't offer any evidence against them.
>
> And so they went free.
>
> As to the march to petition the Prince, it is said that one man, and one man only, actually made it to the city where the Prince lived. Maybe he got lost and didn't realise he was on his own. Who knows?
>
> But what I do know is that this is a true story.
>
> Once, was 1817, and the kingdom was Great Britain. The mad King was King George III, and the Prince was the playboy Price Regent, later George IV. The Ministers, well, they were Lord Liverpool's Tory Government. And the marchers? They were men from Mancheser — The Blanketeers — who set off to march to London in March, 1817, from their original gathering point in St Peter's Field, the scene of the Peterloo massacre two years later. Following the march, the Seditious Meetings Act of 1817 was passed, that banned unapproved gatherings of more than 50 people that would deliberate on grievances against the Church or State, and could lead to a capital death sentence for the organisers.

So what's "real" story, the hi*story* of the Blanketeers?

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Thursday 06 March 1817

The following copied from Tuesday’s *Manchester Mercury*:— " The environs of St. Peter’s Church were yesterday the resort of another political throng, and the declared purpose of the Meeting was to address his Royal Highness the Prince Regent to withhold his assent to the Bill for the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, as well as to take into further consideration the topic of Radical Reform. Some industry been employed to attract a numerous attendance of the population in various directions around us, and our Magistrates and principal town Officers, with their wonted energy and promptitude left nothing undone that prudence might dictate, to be prepared in the event of any attempt at outrage ; an accession to our military force was obtained by the arrival from Bolton of three companies of the 54th regiment of foot, who were held in perfect readiness during the proceedings, to act if there should be occasion for their interference ; the civil power were also fully prepared to do their duty: happily no emergency arose to their presence. From half-past twelve to about half-past three was occupied upon the usual themes of declamation: it was altogether deemed useless to continue any further applications upon the several subjects of complaint; and the meeting dissolved without the specification of any ulterior projects—the orators retiring from their rostrum unable to conceal the most conclusive symptoms of having as bountifully indulged the interior of their persons as the obduracy of the elements had pelted the surface of their mortal frames."

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 11 March 1817

The Manchester Mercury, Tuesday, March 11, 1817.

The lenient moderation of the magistracy has at length eked out the fullest extent of forbearance compatible with the protection which is due to the persons and property of the peaceable and well-disposed part of the community. We find it was among the notifications at the meeting on the 3d inst. near St. Peter's Church, corroborated, in the course of last week, by the declarations individuals who have been actively engaged in promoting the late seditious meetings, that the espousers of their doctrines should collect at the same place the Monday following (yesterday), and proceed to the Metropolis, at nine o'clock, to present a petition to the Prince Regent, that they might be enabled *"to undeceive him ! "* Aware of these intentions, and of the dangers which an immense influx of strangers, irritated by the inflammatory appeals of their factious leaders, (who, under the pretence of promoting Parliamentary Reform, have been for a length of time agitating the minds of the labouring class of society), portended, the conservators of the public tranquillity took every precaution adequate to the occasion.

Yesterday morning, according to the expectations entertained, crowds of people flocked into town from all directions, as early as eight o'clock, and at about nine, the instigators appeared on their temporary stage in cart, and continued to harangue the multitude till their vast increasing numbers suggested the expediency of putting into practice the well-formed arrangements of the civil and military powers. Accordingly, a party of the first Regiment of Dragoons, under Colonel Teesdale, accompanied by the Magistrates of the District, appeared amongst them, and with adroitness and decision almost electrical, surrounded tbe erection, and immediately conveyed the entire group upon it to the New Bayley Prison ; their attention was next directed to the concourse of auditors, who were forthwith dispersed, without the infliction of any severity.

An arrest had taken place early on Sunday morning, of Johnson and Ogden, who had previously figured at this place, and they were secured in the New Bayley. Others were seized by the soldiers on their way to deliver their charge in Salford. The following are the names of prisoners : Drummond, Baguley, (the two orators), Handring, Grimshaw, Lingard, Quiney, Shaw, Wood, Hargraves, Lever, Shawcross, two Williamses, Tucker, Whitworth, Oddey, Bousfield, Kay, Lefgar, Blackshaw, Simms, Thomason, Barlow, Cuthbird, Lees, Hudson, and Higginbotham, (the owner of the cart on which the stage was fixed).

A considerable number of people set out on their mission to London, taking the route of Stockport, but about forty of them were reconducted to Manchester, and added to their other unfortunate companions; others were furnished secure accommodations in Stockport. Most of them were provided with knapsacks, &c. containing blankets and other articles. Upon the examination of some of these travelling equipages, two unusually large knives were discovered.

Johnston, Ogden, &c. will be dispatched, without loss of time, under escort, to the Secretary of State, in London.

We shall desist from entering further at present into the cases of there characters, as they will probably hereafter be the subject High Judicial Enquiry.

The military preparations were under the direction of Sir John Byng, the commander of the district, who arrived in Manchester on Sunday. A party of the Regiment of Foot were present to render their assistance.

We may fairly presume that at one period there was an assemblage of at least thirty thousand at the meeting ; and believe we not over-rate the arrivals in the course of the day at from sixty to seventy thousand individuals.

No particular act of outrage or intemperance has yet reached our ears, and we cannot help feeling highly indebted to the judicious and salutary interposition of the respective authorities for the satisfactory result of this day's transactions. As we are closing this account, we have authority to state, that the apprehensions are nothing short of *two hundred* persons.

[Also reprinted in the *Chester Chronicle* of Friday, 14th March, 1817, [p3](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000342/18170314/008/0003), with tha additional closing paragraph: *We have heard, and it is with grief we notice it, that several of the misguided people were severely hurt by the cavalry.—The mob, we understand, made a very ludicrous appearance; many of them having their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders and fastened in front over the breast with a skewer.—They were in full marching order, those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, having large bundles attached their shoulders.*]

London Chronicle - Friday 14 March 1817

March 13  
EXTRAORDINARY AND ALARMING MEETINGS AT MANCHESTER.

[FROM THE EXCHANGE HERALD.]

Manchester, March 11.  
During the week, the *blanket* story gained ground, and a report of sixty thousand Scottish Reformers being on their way towards London, and that they had even advanced as far as Preston on their way, was prevalent ; whilst accounts of individual preparations for the intended march continually met the ear. There were many persons, however, who did not put any faith in "the often told tale," till Saturday last, when a placard, of which the following is a Copy, was exhibited on the walls of this town and its neighbourhood:—

" PUBLIC MEETING.

"The INHABITANTS of MANCHESTER and its vicinity are respectfully informed, that a PUBLIC MEETING, according to adjournment, will be held near St. Peter's Church, on Monday morning, the 10th of March, 1817, when it is hoped that every person who is determined to carry his Petition to London, will assemble peaceably and orderly, and provide himself with the necessary means of support requisite to bear him through this loyal and necessary undertaking.

" It hoped that those friends of Parliamentary Reform, who possess the means, will come forward on this important occasion.

"Persons will be appinted to receive contributions this evening at NeW Islington, and at the Meeting on Monday.

(Signed) "W. OGDEN, Printer, 26, Wood-street."

Still we should have been skeptics in respect of the report of the intention of the infatuated people to proceed to London, and should have thought the foregoing placard the result of a determination of some one to laugh at credulity, if it had not borne the imprint of a person who had distinguished himself on the cart, at all the preceding Meetings, by haranguing the gaping gulls who surrounded the temporary altar of sedition. His oratorical labours are, however, suspended, for early on Sunday morning he was arrested in his bed, and conveyed to the New Bailey Prison; nearly at the same time, with one Johnstone, a tailor, (the Missionary who was dispatched by the Lancashire Reformers to convert the Staffordshire potters to the new political faith); who, we are told, has distinguished himself in this neighbourhood, for several months past, as or the most violent of the demagogues who have endeavoured to make the working classes subservient to the too evident design of disorganising society, and destroying the Constitution. They labour for the equalisation of property, and like the vultures who hover over contending armies in the hope of a gluttonous feast on the fallen carcasses, they look forward to the glorious time of anarchy which they anticipate as the reward of their present patient attendance on the labour of excitement. Mixed in the crowd, they second the views of the designing men, who, under the plausible pretence of helping the poor and the ignorant to their rights, make them pay for their own undoing. That the poison thus poured into the minds of the unthinking has begun to operate, is too evident. Whenever a decently dressed person, walking out, finds himself in the vicinity of the lower orders of society, the remarks addressd *at*, if not *to* him— as to the sources of his prosperity— that it was the result of the labour of the poor—that all would come round again soon—that, it will be their turn next ! &c. &c. prove the operation of the deleterious principles which have been poured into the ears of the working classes of society. A Reform in Parliament, is but a cry at the present time, used by many to hide the deep design of general devastation.

By the placard which we have quoted, it will be seen that a preparatory Meeting for levying pecuniary means to carry the Resolution of last Monday into execution, was held on Saturday evening at New Islington, Salford; and that other preparatory Meetings were held yesterday morning, very early, at Middleton, Oldham, &c. to instruct men (so systematic are the proceedings of organised disaffection), as to their conduct at the Manchester Meeting on their proposed march to London, and their junction with their brother Reformers in Spafields.

A crowd began to gather on the ground in front of the Quakers' Meeting-house, before nine o'clock, yesterday morning, and a table elevated on a cart was used by a person to write a register of the poor who declared their intention to proceed to London, and to receive money subscribed by the less zealous or more infirm votaries of delusion, in aid of the volunteers. At half past nine, the number of persons on the ground amounted to at least ten thousand, soon after which, a leader of the multitude (whose name we could not learn) came to the field in a hackney-coach, out of which he stepped and mounted the cart. He was received with huzzas ; but we were pleased to observe, that the cheers did not proceed from the bulk qf the assembly, and only from a few of the more insane (not amounting to more than three or four hundred, at the most) who held up and waved their hats.

The greatest praise is due to the care and foresight of the Magistrates and the Boroughreeves and Constables of Manchester and Salford, for the precautionary steps they took. A great number of additional constables had been sworn in, and soon after ten o'clock they proceeded to the neighbourhood of the Meeting, from whence about a thousand men, provided with blankets and such provisions as they could make, had withdrawn a short time before to Piccadilly, from whence they set out soon after on the mad scheme of marching to London. A little before eleven o'clock, whilst the orators were displaying their eloquence in the brickfield, using the most inflammatory language on the one hand, and the greatest persuasion on the other, to induce the silly people who surrounded the cart to contribute bountifully towards defraying the expenses of the blanketeers during their expedition, the preparation of the legal authorities was complete, and the Magistrates, the Municipal Officers, and the Special Constables, and four troops of cavalry, from the barracks (under the direction of Sir John Byng, the Commander of the district,) simultaneously, by a most happy execution of the prepared design, surrounded the seditious hustings, and took all the orators and their papers into custody. Amongst the former was a man of the name of Drummond, provided with a new great coat, &c. to head the column of petitioners who had just before left the ground, and another leader of the name of Baguly. The sweep was instantaneously completed, and the exciters to mischief were immediately marched away prisoners, under a strong escort, to the New Bailey prison, whilst the crowd gave way, to apprehensions for personal safety, and dispersed.

A detachment of peace officers, *under the direction of Magistrates who accompanied them*, immediately after the ringleaders were secured, led a troop of cavalry after the migratory Reformers, who had set out on their way to London, in the expectation of being overtaken very soon by their leaders, bringing with them the money which infatuation had subscribed (we understand to a considerable amount) on the field. The stragglers were overtaken and many were secured, before they had arrived at Longsight ; but at Stockport Bridge the cavalry surrounded a great number, all furnished for bivouacking, and some (if the knives found in their knapsacks indicated any thing) for other purposes, who were made prisoners. Upwards of two hundred have been brought to the New Bailey Prison in the course of the afternoon.

Before we close the account of the proceedings of the day, it is a duty to state, that a detachment of the 54th Regiment of Foot were under arms in the vicinity of the Meeting, but were not called upon to act; that the Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry were also under arms all day in various parts of that county; and that a detachment of several troops evinced their zeal, and entitled them to the thanks of their country, by their services in Manchester, where they volunteered their assistance ; many then having marched at least 30 miles yesterday for that purpose. In the course of the day a part of the 85th Regiment of Foot marched into town; but we are happy to state, that there is no appearance that any thing more will be necessary than the impressin of their presence. In the course of the evening, JOHNSTON, OGDEN, BAGULEY and DRUMMOND, who were, we understand, arrested by virtue of warrants from the Secretary of State's Office, were, we believe, sent off under a proper guard to London. The town is now at peace and free from alarm.

[FROM THE MANCHESTER MERCURY OF TUESDAY.]

We find it was among the notifications at the Meeting on the 3d inst. near St. Peter's Church, corroborated in the course of last week, by the declarations of individuals who have been actively engaged in promoting the late seditious meetings, that the espousers of their doctrines should collect at the same place the Monday following (yesterday) and proceed to the Metropolis, at nine o'clock, to present to the Regent, that they might be enabled "*to undeceive him*".

....

Speaking on the passing of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill, the Editor of *The Glasgow Courier* adds—" The Habeas Corpus Act does not extend to Scotland ; but the present Bill contains a clause suspending, until 1st of July next, part of the Scots Act of 1701, for preventing wrongous imprisonments and undue delays in trials, by which those accused of crimes had a power to *Rurn their Letters*, so that any person imprisoned under suspicion of high treason, or treasonable practices, cannot be liberated, tried, or admitted to bail, without an Order signed by six of his Majesty's Privy Council." On the statement made by the LORD ADVOCATE in the House or Commons, the same writer says, that he hopes " a short time will develop whole of this highly, dangerous conspiracy, and check its baneful procedure, however widely it may have extended its influence."

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 15 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 11.

After the meeting of the Reformers broke up on Monday the 3rd inst. we heard amongst a variety of reports as to the result of their deliberations, a vague indistinct story of a motion to meet again on the following Monday (yesterday), prepared with blankets to proceed to London, to lay their sufferings and their petitions before the Prince Regent, whom it seems, they (all or other) professed to hold in high respect and veneration, whilst the most vile and approbious epithets were levelled at his Ministers. During the week, the blanket story gained ground; and a report of sixty thousand Scottish Reformers being on their way towards London, and that they had even advanced as far as Preston, was prevalent; whilst accounts of individual preparation tor the intended march, continually met the ear. There were many persons, however, who did not put any faith in the "often told tale" till Saturday last, when a placard of which the following is a copy, was exhibited on the walls of this town and its neighbourhood:—

"PUBLIC MEETING

"The Inhabitants of MANCHESTER and its vicinity are respectfully informed that a PUBLIC MEETING regarding to adjournement, will be held near St Peter's Church on Monday morning the 10th of March 1817, when it is hoped that every person who is determined to carry his Petition to London, will assemble peaceably and orderly, and provide himself with the necessary means of support requisite to bear him through this loyal and necessary undertaking.

"It is hoped that these friends of Parliamentary Reform, who possess the means, will come forward on this important occasion.

"Persons will be appointed to receive contributions this evening at New Islington, and at the meeting on Monday. W OGDEN, Printer, 28 Wood Street."

Still we should have been sceptical in respect of the report of the intention of the intimated people to proceed to London and should have thought the foregoing placard the result of a determination of some one to laugh at credulity, if it had not been the imprint of a person who had distinguished himself on the cart at all the preceding meetings, by haranguing the gaping gulls who surrounded the temporary alter of sedition. His oratorical labours are however suspended but early on Sunday morning, he was arrested in his bed, and conveyed to the New Bailey Prison, nearly at the same time with one Johnstone, a tailor (the Missionary who was dispatched by the Lancashire Reformers to convert the Staffordshire Potters to the new political faith); who we are told, has distinguished himself in this neighbourhood for several months past, as one of the most violent of demagogues who have endeavoured to make the working classes subservient to the too evident design of disorganizing society, and destroying the Constitution.

That many persons, willing to labour, have lately wanted employment. we believe: and that of this description some would be found at political meetings; but we also believe, that by far a greater number who are too idle for labour for their bread and who wish for an easier, or rather more luxurious life, swelled their numbers. Both these descriptions are able to be misled by designing orators; and are easily hurried on by the impulsive stream, put in motion by the bad spirits who join mobs of all kinds, in the hope that the consequent bustle will afford opportunity for the exercise of their callings, to plunder, to rob and to murder. Such men are ready to *practice*, and by example, instruct others to practice the doctrine, which the mouth pieces of such meetings *recommend*. They labour for the equalization of property; and like the vultures who hover over contending armies in the hope of a gluttonous feast on the fallen carcases, they look forward to the glorious time of anarchy, which they anticipate as the reward their present patient attendance on the labour of excitement. Mixed in the crowd, they second the views of the designing men, who, under the plausible pretence of helping the poor and the ignorant to their rights, make them pay for their own undoing. That the poison thus poured into the minds of the unthinking has begun to operate is too evident, whenever a decently dressed person, walking out, finds himself in the vicinity of the lower orders of society. The remarks addressed *at*, if not *to* him — as to the sources of his prosperity - that it was the result of the labour of the poor—that all would come round again soon— that it will be their turn next! &c &c. prove the operation of the deleterious principles which have been poured into the ears of the working classes of society. A Reform in Parliament is but a cry at the present time, used by many to hide the deep design of general devastation. To ignorance, to idleness, and improvidence, the doctrine of the Spenceans, by whatever name it is called, has great charms. No wonder it has many votaries. Men acting under such influence  are easily persuaded that the richer part of society are enjoying the fruits of the labour of the poor; that their rulers are their oppressors; and that the wholesome laws of restriction which Parliament, with paternal care, has enacted are acts of tyranny. Can it then be wondered at, that designing men should find tools to work with?

By the placard which we have quoted, it will be seen that a preparatory meeting, for levying pecuniary means to carry the resolution of last Monday into execution was held on Saturday evening at New Islington, Salford and we understand that other preparatory meetings were held yesterday morning, very early, at Middleton, Oldham &c. to instruct men (so systematic are the proceedings of organized disaffection) as to their conduct at the Manchester meeting, on their proposed march to London, and their junction with their brother reformers in Spa-fields.

A crowd began to gather on the ground in front of the Quaker's Meeting-house, before nine o'clock yesterday morning, and a table, elevated on a cart, was used by a person to write a register of the names of the poor, infatuated wretches who declared their intention to proceed to London, and to receive money, subscribed by the less zealous, or more infirm votaries of delusion, in aid of the volunteers. At half-past nine the number of persons on the ground amounted to at least ten thousand `[One of the Manchester papers says from 25 to 30,000 ]`, soon after which, a leader of the multitude (whose name we could not learn) came to the field in a hackney-coach out of which he stepped and mounted the cart. He was received with huzzas; but we were pleased to observe, that, the cheers did not proceed from the bulk of the assembly, and only from a few of the more insane (not amounting to more than three or four hundred at the most) who held up and waved their hats.

The greatest praise is due to the care and foresight of the Magistrates and the Boroughreeves and Constables of Manchester and Salford for the precautionary steps thev took.

A little before eleven o'clock, whilst the Orators were displaying their eloquence in the brick-field, using the most inflammatory language on the one hand, and the greatest persuasion on, the other, to induce the silly people who surrounded the cart to contribute bountifully towards defraying the expenses of the blanketeers during their expedition, the preparation of the legal authorities was complete, and the Magistrates, the Municipal Officers, and the Special Constables, and four troops of cavalry from the barracks, (under the direction of Sir John Byng, the Commander of the District) simultaneously, by a most happy execution of the prepared design, surrounded the seditious hustings, and took all the orators and their papers into custody.

Upwards of two hundred were brought to New Bailey Prison in the afternoon.

Before we close the account of the proceedings of the day, it is a duty to state, that a detachment of the 54th regiment of foot was under arms, in the vicinity of the meeting, but were not called upon to act; and that the Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry were under arms all day in various parts of that county and a detachment of several troops, evinced their zeal, and entitled them to the thanks of their country, by their services in Manchester, where they volunteered their assistance; many of them having marched at least thirty miles yesterday for that purpose.In the course of the day, a part of the 55th regiment of foot marched into town, but we are happy to state that there is no appearance of there being any necessity for any thing more than the impression of their presence. In the course of the evening, Johnstone, Ogden, Baguley and Drummond, who were, we understand, arrested by virtue of warrants from the Secretary of State's Office, were, we believe, sent off under a proper guard to London. The town is now at peace and free from alarm.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 22 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 18.

A number of the designing or deluded persons about Manchester have been apprehended and conveyed to the Castle of Chester, in addition to those mentioned apprehended last week and committed to the New Bailey, Manchester. They were apprehended at Heaton Norris, and are charged in the commitment with treasonable and seditious practices. They appeared to be a wretched set of individuals, and two of them mere youths. The Chester papers state that Pike-heads, and numbers of heavy sticks, containing a kind of daggers, about eight inches long, have been found at Stockport. Several of the deluded men were cut in the face in opposing the cavalry. The Blanketeers are represented to have made a very ludicrous appearance; many them having their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders en militaire. Many of them swam several rivers elude the civil and military power waiting at bridges to intercept them.

A Manchester paper Tuesday says, " the number of unfortunate objects confined in our prison exceeded 250, of whom 120 have been examined by W.D. Evans Esq. and of whom 40 have been discharged, and 80 committed for want of securities."

It is a well known fact, that *Evening Meetings* have been held for a long time past, at least twice a week, to which persons have been admitted indiscriminately, in a large old Spinning Factory, at New Islington, Ancoats. A room in it in it, capable of holding thousands of persons, with a rostrum in the centre, has been frequently filled. During the last week these assemblies have been held every night, to engage the deluded in this wild but dangerous enterprise of marching to London with petitions, and to collect contributions for the purpose. Leaders of tens, fifties, &c. were appointed, and every tenth man was to be the bearer of a petition.

These petitions, it appears, were not only of one import, but (numerous they were, one to every ten Political Pilgrims) were *exactly the same*, being copied from a prepared form, printed for the purpose by Ogden. Many these petitions, fairly engrossed, (but many instances only signed by one person, and in several *without a single signature*,) were found in the hands of the leaders of the march.

From the *Macclesfield Courier* we learn, that that town and neighbourhood, were thrown into a state of great alarm so early as Saturday the 8th inst. by the prevalent report that "10,000 Scotsmen, clothed in plaid," had entered Manchester, with the certainty of being joined about 40,000 Lancashire men.

On Wednesday, another arrest took place, by virtue of a warrant sent down from the Secretary of State's Office, when Elijah Dixon, a cotton spinner, was taken at work, in Manchester, where he was in the habit of earning considerable weekly wages. He was sent off to London the same evening, under the conduct of a Police Officer; and on Friday delivered up to the custody of the keeper of one of the London Bridewells, previous to his examination.

"Combination has led to Conspiracy, Conspiracy to Treason against the State ; and had it not been tor the wise, forbearing vigilance of our Magistrates, seconded by the active care of our Police, scenes of misery might have occurred in this populous district and elsewhere, which cannot be imagined but with horror. It is a circumstance not altogether conjectural, that at given points on their approach to the capital, arms and ammunition were expected to be prepared for them.— The facility too with which contributions have been levied and obtained for these unworthy purposes is truly astonishing, if the nature of the times and the cry of misery which has been prevalent be taken into consideration." —*Manch. Chron.*

This altair shows the wisdom and necessity of the late proceedings in parliament, by which government has been armed with extraordinary powers to counteract the designs of faction. If any before doubted whether a case sufficiently strong had been made out, it can scarcely be doubted now. If the organization of the disaffected societies was so complete, and the delusion spread through the disaffected classes so extensive, that, at the appointment of a few desperate characters, a mob of 50 or 60,000 persons could be drawn together to one place, at a given time, and the greater part so devoted to their instigators, as to be ready to engage in any project, however mischievous and insane, which they might direct, as, for instance, to march in a body to London, to throw the country into disorder throughout their march, and to live on free quarters on the inhabitants, (the only means they had of subsistence,) than was it high time for the country to call for additional protection, and for parliament to grant it. What can those delectabie politicians in the abstract, who have enamoured against a standing army in time of peace, say ? Was the civil power equal to such an emergence ? If, when regular troops, and others of the military are at hand, such bold attempts are made at disorder, what must have been our condition had the army been disbanded, and that arm of our defence cut off by the knife of retrenchment? The folly of those who are ever declaiming on abstract rights and ?? [desires?], without any regard to what is fit and practicable, is sufficiently evident; and it is pitiable, and marks the infirmity of many acute minds; but there is a numerous class, who know what they mean when they reiterate the arguments and declamations of persons, who, though they do much mischief, do not, in truth, design it. The straight forward men clamour against taxation, because they wish to get rid of the army, and they wish the army disbanded, because it is an inconvenient obstruction to the operation of reforming mobs. They have the same objection to the civil power being strengthened ; they have bawled with all their breath against the swearing in of special constables, and have held the measure up, in the words of a notable oracle of the faction, as "a conspiracy against the liberties and rights of the people;" and why ? They wish to mob without control, and to revolutionize without check.—*Liverpool Courier.*

SEDITIOUS MEETING BILL

...

*Friday March 21.*

...

SEDITIOUS MEETINGS BILL.

Lord Viscount SIDMOUTH moved the Order of the Day, which having been read, the House resolved itself into a Committee on the Seditious Meetings Bill.

Lord GRENVILLE objected to certain clauses as not sufficiently clear in the wording.

Lord HOLLAND thought the penalty of death was by far too severe to be inflicted in the circumstances described in the Bill.

Lord St JOHN objected to the power being lodged in one magistrate, when two were required to remove a pauper, and the whole magistracy of a county could not in other cases subject an individual to the punishment of death.

After some further discussion, it was agreed to leave out the words " in such a case" to prevent any ambiguity with regard to the legality of meetings. But Lord St John's amendment to vest the power of dispersing a meeting in two justices instead of one, and Lord Holland's amendment to leave out the words making the penalty death, were negatived.

Lord ERSKINE objected to that part of the Bill which gave one Justice of Peace the power of deciding whether a notice tended to stir up the people to hatred or contempt of the government. This would give a power to a single Justice of Peace, which since the libel act had been denied to the Judges of the land. Another clause gave one Justice a power to decide as to the tendency of words spoken at meetings lawfully assembled. This he thought extremely dangerous, He thought clauses of this nature would tend to increase the characteristic delusion of the present time, which was, that Parliament was not attentive to the interests or liberties of the people. He moved an amendment on the clauses he objected to.

Lord ELLENBOROUGH said, the clause was ho doubt objectionable as conferring discretionary powers, but there was no choice but that of entrusting such a discretionary power, or of leaving the people to be inflamed by the meetings which it was the object of the Bill to guard against.

Some farther conversation took place between Lords GRENVILLE, HOLLAND, LAUDERDALE, and the Lord CHANCELLOR. The amendments moved, with the exception of one or two of a verbal nature were negatived ; and the Bill was ordered to be reported on Monday.

*Monday, March 24.*

SEDITIOUS MEETINGS BILL.

The Earl of SHAFTESBURY reported the Seditious Meetings Bill.

The LORD CHANCELLOR proposed several verbal amendments, which were agreed to.

Lord HOLLAND ( with respect to the punishment of death ) again moved the Amendment which he had brought forward in the Committee, it was negatived.

With respect to the Licenses granted to Lecture Rooms and Debating Societies,

The Earl of LAUDERDALE thought the exceptions from the operation of this clause did not extend far enough, and that there could be no objection to include in those exceptions Lectures merely on physical science. He was the more anxious upon this point, because in Edinburgh, where the Magistrates were the Patrons of the University, they might be induced, for the sake of promoting the interests of the University, to put down all private Lectures, and it was well known that the Students frequently derived more advantage from the latter, than from what they learned within the University. He wished to confine his Amendment to the physical sciences, in order to obviate the objection that Lectures upon morality, religion, and some other topics, might be liable to be abused. His Lordship then moved a clause, exempting from the operation of the licensing enactments, Lectures on Anatomy, Pharmacy, Midwifery, Astronomy, Chemistry, or other branches of physical science.

Lord Viscount MELVILLE said, that the power of licensing would not be limited to the Magistrates of Edinburgh, who were the Patrons of the University, but would be possessed under the Bill by all the Justices of Peace in that City, and equally also within the City by the Justices for the County.

The Clause was negatived.

On the Clause respecting Clubs or Societies, the Members of which were required to sign any test or declaration,

Lord HOLLAND observed, that it was too extensive in its wording. There were many Clubs or Societies in this Metropolis, in which the Members were perhaps called upon to sign some declaration merely relating to the payment of a subscription, or the drinking of certain toasts. The Members of these Societies might naturally feel repugnant to submit mere nonsense to the inspection of Justices ot the Peace, and he haw no reason why they should be subjected to the inconvenience. Freemasons were excepted, and why should not other Societies, equally harmless in their object ?

Lord ERSKINE remarked, it was important to observe, that this part of the Bill was intended to be permanent, and therefore they should be undoubtedly more cautious as to what they enacted. Their object certainly ought to be to impose as few restrictions as possible upon the people, because by imposing unnecessary restraints they might produce discontent, and excite a spirit of hostility in place of that love which persons bore to a country having the sacred character of freedom. There were other Societies besides Freemasons which might have, perhaps, tests equally solemn, but which were equally harmless.

The Earl of LIVERPOOL said, there was no intention whatever of subjecting to inconvenience mere Convivial Societies, which might he productive of pleasure or advantage to individuals. But if any clubs or societies had any test or declaration, attended with any solemnity, it was but fair that they should be subjected to the superintendence in that respect of Justices of the Peace.

The Clause was then agreed to.

An Amendment, proposed by Earl GROSVENOR, to limit the duration of the Bill to the 1st July 1817, was negatived.

Lord Viscount Sidmouth proposed a clause to prohibit public meetings within a mile of the two Houses of Parliament when sitting, or of the Courts of Justice when sitting at Westminster.

The Earl of ROSSLYN contended, that there was no reason why the inhabitants of Westminster should not have the exercise of a privilege,which was possessed by the inhabitants of every other part of London. He should have preferred that a Clause of so much importance had been introduced into the Bill at first, rather than now, towards the very close of any discussion upon it.

Lord Liverpool said, it was certainly most desirable that the Members of their Lordships' House, and of the other House of Parliament, should not be exposed to those gross outrages which has sometimes occurred, when coming down to Parliament in the exercise of their public duty ; their dignity imperiously demanded such a protection.

After some observations by Lords Lauderdale, Erskine and Grenville, the clause was agreed to and the Amendments being all gone through, the Bill was then ordered to be read a third time tomorrow, and the House adjourned.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 01 April 1817

The Blanketeers' Petition.

The following it a copy of the Petition which Malcontents were to carry forward to the Prince Regent, from the press of tbe State Prisoner Odden:—

THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED, INHABITANTS MANCHESTER,IN THE COUNTV OF LANCASTER,

*Humbly Sheweth,*

" That your Petitioners, before the last war, neither felt nor feared either difficulties or privations; but during the continuance have frequently experienced both, and have repeatedly applied to your Royal Father, your Royal Highness, and the House of Commons, for redress, which applications, we are sorry to say, have in our humble, but firm, belief, not received that attention which their importance merited; so that now, when the waste of war is over, our sufferings are become both more general and deeper than ever.

" This state of things, we, your Petitioners, attribute to the rapid increase of taxation, which has been quadrupled, together with the increase of rent, which has probably, been doubled during the war; which, tohether so nearly absorb the whole produce of the kingdom, as to leave a quantity very far short of being sufficient to keep your Petitioners in existence, and therefore their lives are now become a burden and a plague to them ; your distressed Petitioners are further convinced, that if the House of Commons had really emanated from, and been wholly and annually appointed by, the People at large, this war, and the taxation resulting therefrom, would long ago have received a sufficient check, even admitting the nation have sanctioned its commencement— that the laws to regulate the importation of corn, calculated to advance its price, would never have been suffered to pass—that the law of libel, which subjects the publishers of truth in some instances to great pains and penalties, thereby preventing the publication of the most important truths, could never have received the sanction of the friends of truth and mankind— that a Bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, a Bill empowering Ministers to imprison, without proof of guilt, whomsoever they please, and for an unknown length time—could never have passed.

"Your Petitioners therefore humbly, but fervently, pray, that your Highness will instantly dismiss from your Councils all those Ministers who have advised or devised such cruel, such unjust measures, and call to your Councils even who are the declared or avowed friends to conciliatory measures—to Parliamenetary Reform— and a general and very considerable retrenchment in every part of national expenditure. Our lives are in your hands—our happiness, in great measure, depends on you. °If you procure the adoption of measures calculated to relieve us, you may then safely rely upon our support and gratitude— WITHOUT THIS, WE CAN NEITHER SUPPORT YOU NOR OURSELVES. Your gracious attention to our prayers will gain you eternal esteem and gratitude of your Petitioners, who will ever pray."

The following Circular has been issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department .

( COPY)— Circular— *Whitehall , March* 27 . 1817 .

My Lord , —As it is of the greatest importance to prevent as far as possible the circulation of Blasphemous and Seditious Pamphlets and Writings, of which, for a considerable time past, great numbers have been sold and distributed throughout the country; I have thought it my duty to consult the Law Officers of the Crown, whether an individual found selling, or in any way publishing such Pamphlets or Writings might be brought immediately before a Justice of the Peace, under a warrant issued for the purpose, to answer for his conduct. The Officers having accordingly taken this matter into their consideration, have notified to me their opinion, That a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged before him upon oath, with the publication of Libels of the nature in question, and compel him to give bail to answer the charge. Under these circumstances, I beg leave to call your Lordship's attention very particularly to this subject; and I have to request, that if your Lordship should not propose to attend in person at the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden in and for the county under your Lordship's charge, you would make known to the Chairman of such Sessions the substance of this communication, in order that he may recommend to the several Magistrates to act thereupon in all cases where any person should be found offending against the law in the manner above mentioned. I beg leave to add, that persons vending Pamphlets or other Publications, in the manner alluded to, should be considered as coining under the provisions of the Hawker's and Pedlar's Act, and be dealt with accordingly, unless they shew that they are furnished, with a License, as required by the said Act. I am, &c. SIDMOUTH.

To his Majesty's Lieutenant in the county of _____.

[TH: we might also note further down the page, the following report: *By accounts received from Leicester we learn that eight of the Luddites, tried at that town , have_been capitally convicted , and received sentence of death . A ninth ( JOHN SLATER ) has been convicted under the Frame-breaking Act , and sentenced to transportation for life . The tenth was seized with convulsion fits during his trial , and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence , was remanded to prison .*]

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Sunday 04 May 1817

LORD SIDMOUTH'S CIRCULAR.

OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN, REFERRED TO IN THE CIRCULAR LETTER FROM VISCOUNT SIDHOUTH TO HIS MAJESTY’S LIEUTENANTS OF COUNTIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, DATED MARCH 27, 1817.

We are of opinion that a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party charged on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice Of the Peace. With respect to the Secretary of-State, in the case of Entick v. Carrington, reported by Mr. Hargrave, though the Court were of opinion the warrants which were then the subject of discussion were illegal, yet Lord Camden declared, and in which he stated the other Judges agreed with him, that they were bound to adhere to the determination of the Queen v. Derby, and the King v. Earbury ;in both of which cases it had been holden, that it was competent to the Secretary of State to issue a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with a scandalous and seditious libel; and that they, the Judges, had no right to overturn those decisions.

With respect to the power of a Judge to issue such warrant, it appears us, that at all events, under the statute of the 48th Geo. III. ch. 58, a Judge has such power, upon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that act; a Judge would probably expect that it should appear to be the intention of the Attorney-General to file Information against the person charged.

With respect to a Justice of the Peace, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Mr. Wilkes's libels only amounts to this—that libel is not such an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his Privilege of Parliament, or to warrant the demanding sureties of the peace from the defendant: but there is no decision or opinion that a Justice of the Peace might not apprehend any person not privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge. It has certainly been the opinion of one of our most learned predecessors that such warrants may be issued and acted upon by Justices of the Peace, as appears by the cases of Thomas Spence and Alexander Hogg in the year 1801. We agree in that opinion, and therefore think that a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information on oath with the publication of a scandalous and seditious libel, and compel him to give bail to answer such charge. W. GARROW. S. SHEPHERD.  Lincoln-Inn, Feb. 24, 1817.

The Scotsman - Saturday 17 May 1817

IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT

HOUSE OF LORDS

*Monday May 12th*

CIRCULAR LETTER OF VISCOUNT SIDMOUTH.

Earl GREY rose to bring forward his promised motion relative to this subject. He had to request the most serious attention of their Lordships to what would transpire in the discussion, as it may constitute the foundation of some future proposition to be submitted. It appeared, that under this new practice, for such he must call it, being unsupported by any previous authority, a Justice of the Peace was empowered to send any man to gaol upon a charge of publishing a blasphemous or seditious libel, unless he procured bail. Now what said the opinion of the Law Officers referred to ? " That a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party charged on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice of the Peace. " With regard to the power of a Secretary of State to issue warrants, that had been so well established by the decisions of Courts, that he did not now intend to dispute it. Whether it was originally an usurpation or not, it had been established by competent legal authorities. The opinion proceeded to state ( and he had a right to presume that a Judge had no such power at common law, as it was not stated in the opinion ), " that, at all events, under the Statute of the 48th of George the Third ; chapter 58, a Judge has such a power, upon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that Act, a Judge would probably expect that it should appear to be the intention of the Attorney-Genaral to file an information against the person charged." He apprehended the true construction of the Act to be, that there must be an affidavit or certificate of an information filed, before the Judge could grant a warrant. The opinion then went on to refer to the case of Mr. Wilkes, and to state that the decision in that case amounts only to this, " that libel is not such an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his privilege of Parliament, or to warrant the demanding sureties of the peace from the defendant ; but there is no decision or opinion that a Justice of the Peace miqht not apprehend a person not so privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge." The necessary of such an opinion must be to give to every Justice of the Peace in the kingdom the power of holding to bail any person, or of depriving such person of his liberty, for any publication whatever which that Justice might, in his opinion, deem a libel. And this was not confined to blasphemous or seditious libels, to the former of which the opinion did not allude, but it applied to all libels, private or public , whether deemed scandalous or malicious, or blasphemous or seditious. In any case in which a Justice of the Peace deemed a libel to have been published, he was to be authorised to hold the party to bail. To justify this opinion, the Law Officers referred to the opinion of a learned predecessor of theirs. He could not, however, after the most patient investigation, discover any authority upon which the dictum now set up in the opinion and the Circular could be supported. As tho Noble Earl proceeded in his discussion, he referred largely, and read copious extracts from the writings and decisions of the most established English law authorities ; the general drift of his legal argument being to establish, that the ordinary Magistrates or Justices of the Peace possessed no such legal power, as they were assumed to be vested with in the Circular Letter of the Noble Secretary of State. Even from the opinion referred to itself, it appeared that, previously to the Bill of the King, their were strong doubts as to the existence of such a legal power even in a Judge. He felt warranted in contending that the act in question did not give such a power generally to the Judges, and still more, he must protest against the existence of such a legal power as was claimed generally for all Justices of the Peace, to decide what was or was not a libel ( which was the most difficult point in the whole system of the law ), and upon their opinions of the cases, to exact bail from any man who was concerned in the publications in questions. He had no difficulty in stating from the best examination he was able to give to all the great law authorities of the realm, that he could not find any such power distinctly stated, as that now claimed for Justices of the Peace. He ( Lord Grey ) was aware that this was open to question : but if so great an authority as Lord Coke entertained even a doubt of the power of a single Magistrate to commit for felony, their Lordships ought not to decide without being very sure of the ground of their decision, that a Magistrate had that power with reference to any less offence. On a point so material to the liberty of the subject, the question was, whether any clear and distinct opinion could be found that a libel, because it was cognisable at a Sessions, was an offence for which, out of Sessions, and before the finding of an indictment, a Magistrate had the power to order a warrant of commitment, in default of bail ? There was a passage in Hawkins, referring to a practice, which might be supposed to convey to the Magistrate a more extensive authority. " It is now the practice, " said he, "for a single Magistrate to issue his warrant on the suspicion of felony, or of any other misdemeanour, before the indictment is found. " But it was by no means a fair construction of the passage, to contend tha the offence of libel was comprehended in its meaning; and from the context, he maintained that the opinion of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins was decidedly against the legality of any such power in a Magistrate as that in question.—"For," added he, speaking of the practice with reference to a misdemeanour, "as it is a claim which a justice possesses by connivance rather than from law, he cannot be too cautious in its exercise." On the whole, therefore, the great legal authority of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, instead of sanctioning the opinion recently delivered by the Law Officers of the Crown, directly militated against it. He was aware that a particular passage in the works of Lord Chief Justice Hale seemed to countenance the opinion recently given. But it was evidently felonious offences alone to which Lord Chief Justice Hale referred when he spoke of "such crimes as were withing the cognisance of the Sessions of the Peace." The title of the chapter assisted to prove this. It was "Concerning Felonies." It was an acknowledged rule of construction, that an opinion must be taken with reference to the subject propounded for discussion. What was that subject in this case ? Felonies. It must have been to felonies, therefore, that Lord Chief Justice Hale adverted : and the passage in question could not legitimately receive that extensive construction which some might wish to move it. But in the second volume of his works, Lord Chief Justice Hale spoke more distinctly on the subject. His statement was, " A Justice of the Peace has the power to grant a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with felony or breach of the peace, although not indicted. " In support of this opinion the Lord Chief Justice Hale cited many cases to prove the legality of this power in cases of felony and breaches of the peace, but in no other cases. He confined himself specifically and distinctly to felonies and breaches of the peace, and did not utter a word beyond those cases. Such appeared to be the limit of the Magistrate's authority. There was nothing here to support the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, " that a Justice of the Peace might issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information, on oath, with the publication of a scandalous and seditious libel, and to compel him to give bail to answer to such charge. " The utmost that could be made of the case by human ingenuity would be, to leave the matter in some degree of doubt ; although, for himself, he declared he had no doubt whatever respecting it. But admitting that it was doubtful, it was certainly not a case which a Secretary of State, on the authority of the Law Officers of the Crown, was warranted in recommending to the general adoption of the Magistrates throughout the kingdom. The Noble Lord dwelt with most force and at greatest length on the consideration of the celebrated proceedings which took place before Lord Camden, in the of Mr. Wilkes. The decision of that most learned and revered Lawyer was, he contended, in support of what he advanced, though the case respected a warrant of the Secretary of State. The authority of Lord Mansfield also, in certain cases to which he referred, was in furtherance of this argument. In this part of the discussion, the Noble Earl distinguished between the powers vested legally and constitutionally in a Secretary of State, and those lodged in an ordinary Justice of the Peace ; and seemed to admit, that in the former those powers were vested, which were were now assumed to be vested in the superior Magistrate : and he descanted on the difficulty in legally deciding upon cases of libel which were endeavoured to be simplified and defined by the admirable Bill of a late Right Hon. Friend, of his ( Mr Fox ), the greatest lawyer of an uneducated man he ever, knew, and, which was most ably supported by his Noble Friend ( Lord Erskine ) then present ; and he adjured the House not to lend its sanction to a new and anomalous power in the law, so dangerous to individuals, and eventually dangerous to the State itself. The opinions given by the law servants of the Crown could not, he thought, be without some degree of bias on their minds, and those opinions ought to be appreciated by their Lordships. Independent of the objectionable considerations in a legal view of the case, such an interference on the part of the Executive Government to influence the administration of justice, ought seriously to be deprecated. The whole presented a case of a dangerous and unconstitutional nature ; and in deciding upon it their Lordships should seriously consider its probable consequences, either with a view to the eventual effect it might have on the conduct of the people on the one hand, or on the other in strengthening the overgrown power of the Government, so as to create a power in its hands not a little participating of the character of a military despotism. After apologising to the House for his long detention, the Noble Lord closed a short but eloquent peroration, by moving, " That a Copy of the Case, upon which the opinion of his Majesty's Law Officers, referred to in the Circular Letter, of Viscount Sidmouth, was given, be laid before the House. "

Lord Ellenborough said, no person doubted that a person guilty of vending such publications as could tend to inflame the public mind, should be held responsible for them. The custom of the Attorney-General on the last day of every term, in moving for a continuation of recognisances, justified what he was now saying. Indeed, from the very nature of the case, he was fully satisfied that Magistrates had the powers now assigned them ; and in fact the country would be placed in a truly miserable situation were such not the case. If this was not the law of the country, it would be impossible for the Courts of Law to proceed in business ; and he must beg leave to add, that it would be impolitic in their Lordships to adjourn a single day without taking some steps to make this a law. He now held in his hand an extract of the dates of recognisances which had been entered into on this subject, by which it had been held that persons might be put to bail for libels, before indictments were found or even filed against them. The Attorney-General's Lechmere and North, &c. had done so ; and the uniform practice of the Courts had shewn the authority and rectitude of such proceedings. In the case of a conspiracy, he must confess he should, without doubt, hold the person liable to bail. He had never heard it disputed that Magistrates could hold to bail, and he believed this had been the understood practice from the era of the Revolution. No individual, he believed, could have more regret than himself at seeing an individual unnecessarily exorcised by law, but still he saw no reason why a person should be screened from the effects of his delinquency. On the whole his Lordship, considering the Magistracy had the power which this circular letter supposed them to have, declared that he was decidedly prepared to give his vote accordingly.

Earl Grey's motion having been ably supported by Lords ERSKINE and HOLLAND, and opposed by the Lord CHANCELLOR and Viscount SIDMOUTH, was, on a division, negatived by a majority of S8.

Adjourned.

Liverpool Mercury - Friday 12 September 1817

*The Blanketeers.— Lancaster Assizes.*

On Saturday last, a special jury was appointed to try the *Blanketeers*, as they were called, from Manchester. They were charged with convening a tumultuous and riotous assembly, under the pretext for petitioning; and for for conspiring to insult and intimidate his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, by collecting large multitudes of people, and conspiring to repair to London. Ith to present petitions and remonstrances, &c. to him. There were seven of these men indicted: three were defended by Mr. Williams, and four by Mr. Holt.— When the trial was called on, Mr. Topping, the leading counsel for the crown, rose and said, "That it was not his intention to offer any evidence against the defendants. At the time the charge was preferred, Manchester was much agitated; but tranquillity now prevailed throughout the county, and a new tone and condition of things had arisen. That his Majesty's government, therefore, never desirous to prosecute any of the king's subjects, but in cases where the public safety demanded it, thought it unnecessary to press any thing against the defendants under the present circumstances, and therefore, he, Mr. Topping, should offer no evidence." The defendants were accordingly acquitted.

THE BLANKETEERS.

[*From the Manchester Gazette.*]

We have this week to congratulate our readers on the termination of another political prosecution. Of the nine persons who were committed to Lancaster Castle as Blanketeers, on or about the 21st of March last, two were discharged some time ago, under circumstances, with the particulars of which we are unaquainted but we believe on bail to appear in the King's Bench, and the remaining seven were ordered for trial, by a special jury, on Saturday last, before Mr. Baron Wood. But the courage of the prosecutors could not bear up against the weakness of their cause, and the men were discharged without trial. We find it is intended by those who have had the direction of this prosecution, to take credit for leniency and for bearance; and the prisoners may possibly be told, as Dr Watson was in effect, and almost in terms?, by the London ministerial papers, that they ought to be grateful they have not been hanged without ceremony. It shall be our business to enquire whether they have any thing to be grateful for.

Let it be remembered then, that on the 10th of March a meeting peacably assembled for a purpose of which the legality has never been disproved, though its impropriety has been generally admitted, was dispersed in a very summary and unceremonious manner — that no mild remonstrances no conciliatory admonitions were given to the mistaken populace; but that without even the customary form of reading the riot act, which the law then at least peremptorily enjoined, the dragoons, acting we suppose under the orders of civil officers, galloped amongst the defenceless and unresisting multitude and dispersed them in all directions — that from this operation, death in two instances ensued, in one of which cases, the coroner's inquest returned a verdict of "Wilful murder against some soldier unknown"— that the military and constables were dispatched after some hundreds of simpletons, who had set out on the fool's errand of a march to London and that of these, upwards of two hundred and fifty were taken into custody, and carried under a powerful escort to the New Bayley prison, which contained, even previous to their arrival, nearly three times the number of prisoners it was originally calculated to receive — that they were there confined many, or the whole of them, we know not which, for at least nine days and nights until "with the sanction of government," they were liberated -— that previous to their being discharged, many were bound over to keep the peace, which they had not broken, some under sureties, and others in their personal recognizances; and that when the bulk were disposed of, there still remained nine whom the magistrates thought proper to commit to Lancaster castle. Let it be remembered, that these nine persons were committed in time for trial at the spring assizes — that, for some purpose of their prosecutors, over which the prisoners had no control, but for which, *doubtless they ought to feel grateful*, they were not then tried, although the day for their trial was actually fixed, and their witnesses were all in Lancaster `[It is not a little extraordinary that on the ??? morning of the day fixed for the trial of the Blanketeers, at the Spring Assizes, a Writ of C???? be produced on the part of the Crown; pa???? this proceeding, followed quite close upon ??? a declaration by the Reverend? and Patriotric ????? who resides in the neighbourhood of Liverpoll ??? would take care that the men had Counsel ??? the time for the trial was fixed) it? had been ???? they would be completely undefended. ]` — and that from that time to the present, they have experienced all the unmitigated horrors of close and rigorous imprisonment — that they were again ordered for trial at the assizes which have just concluded by a special jury, very extraordinarily composed, though, no doubt, chosen in a manner perfectly legal — that they were in such circumstances, as to be completely destitute of the means of obtaining a defence —that, however, by the assistance of some persons, who thought them hardly used, witnesses had been, at considerable expence, brought over to Lancaster and two eminent counsel retained in their behalf, both of whom strongly maintained that the prisoners had broken no law, and consequently could not be convicted of any offence— that when the day fixed upon for the trial came, and they were prepared and anxious to meet it, the prosecutors shrunk from the investigation they themselves had instituted, and withdrew the charge.— Let all these facts be remembered and we believe not one of them can be disproved, and then let their prosecutors claim credit for forbearance, if they can.

Who the prosecutors really are in this case, we are entirely ignorant. We understand however, from very good authority, although Mr Topping's observations seem to imply the contrary, that government some time ago distinctly disclaimed all connection or participation in it, and that, therefore all the responsibility rests with some person or persons in this neighbourhood. To us, it appears one of the most cruel cases of oppression we have ever met with; and knowing, as we do, that, subsequent to the period at which government is said to have disclaimed any interference in the affair, active exertions were used to obtain evidence in order to strengthen the cases against the prisoners, and this up to the very time of the commencement of the assizes, we think the public will easily decide upon the true nature of the motives that have inflamed the prosecutors.

The reason assigned by Mr Topping for calling no evidence in the case , viz. " the restoration of tranquillity in this district," we do not hesitate to consider as a subterfuge, intended to conceal from the public the real cause of the line of conduct which was adopted. We assert, as we have asserted before, that the tranquillity of this district has never been disturbed; and we have no doubt that the charge against the Blanketeers was withdrawn only because their prosecutors preferred an awkward and ridiculous retreat to the almost absolute certainty of public and unpitied discomfiture. We think likewise, knowing the general feeling of lawyers upon the case, and the sentiments of the Judge, as said to have been expressed at the spring assizes, that it was prudent of them not to expose their conduct to the comments of the independent bar. Perhaps the poverty of the accused may prevent their being called upon to account for their conduct in a court of justice, but we think a very strong case of false imprisonment might easily be made out against them; for it surely is not to be tolerated, that Englishmen should be dragged to a dungeon, confined there during a long and lingering period of imprisonment, and at last be dismissed at the pleasure of we know not whom, without trial, and consequently without the opportunity of substantiating their innocence.

We have been the more free in our comments on this transaction, because we believe the opinion to be general amongst lawyers, that *the prisoners had committed no offence, either in law or fact* `[The indictment in fact did not on *the face it charge any thing* which is known to the law as a crime.]`; and our readers will be surprised to learn, that such was the laughable weakness even of the principal charge, that *there was actually appended to its tail*, a count in the indictment, under which the prisoners were accused of begging.!!!*

We do not wish to refer to any thing which took place in March last, in which we were individually concerned, yet we do not feel that we can with propriety, omit to request that our readers sill remember, that a learned magistrate then thought proper to animadvert upon our conduct with some severity from the bench. Some of the remarks we had made upon the then recent proceedings were censured (at least so the papers stated) as "highly libellous."— We should be glad to know whether that epithet was applied to them because they were false, or because they were true; for we believe, that every assertion or prediction we then ventured to make, has since been most fully confirmed. It is now generally admitted, that the meeting of the 10th March was dispersed by the soldiery without any reading of the riot act; and, we believe, that it will not be denied that this proceeding was illegal. Nay, it formed the professed and avowed ground, as we understood at the time, upon which the coroner's jury, in the case of the man killed at Heaton Norris, returned a verdict of " Wilful murder ;" and we have seen, as we said it would be found, that none of the persons arrested in this neighbourhood on charges of treason were ever intended to be brought to trial.

Whatever motives may he attributed to us now, we know our own object to be conciliatory, and our views constitutional. To the poor we recommend it always to confine themselves within the usual and acknowledged limits of constitutional proceeding; and upon those who are vested with authority, we would strongly enforce the duty of tempering justice with mercy— of not creating or feeding public alarm by hasty or exaggerated statements of public danger, of confining themselves in the discharge of their duties strictly and scrupulously within the limits of the law, seeing that any assumption of more than legal authority, is less excusable in those whose duty it is to administer, and consequently to understand, the law, than even a transgression of it by those in whom such transgression may fairly be attributed to ignorance or misapprehension.

On looking back to the alarming statements which were authoritatively circulated about the period to which we have referred, we are sometimes tempted to smile at the contrast exhibited between them and the actual state of facts as they really existed at the time, and as they are now generally admitted to have existed. But every feeling of levity is checked by the recollection of the horrible and arbitrary legislative proceedings, which were founded upon them, and which they were intended to excuse. We cannot smile when we reflect that there is an unknown number of our neighbours and fellow-townsmen, still lingering in solitary imprisonment—that they are, till we know not what distant period, doomed to pine through the miserable interval of existence, debarred from every intercourse with their fellow-men, shut almost absolutely "from the common use of air and of their own limbs," and dependent for their restoration to society, not upon the favourable termination of a public and constitutional trial, but upon the capricious and wayward determination of those who must hate, because they have injured them.

We know well the share which spies and plot-creators have had in the present suspension of the constitution. We consider this neighbourhood as containing the nucleus from which the whole brood were hatching; and we trust in Heaven the time is fast approaching, when the spy system and its abettors will be held up: as they deserve, to the contempt and indignation of every honest man.

CHAPTER V.
HABEAS CORPUS ACT SUSPENDED — BLANKET MEETING AT MAN- CHESTER — MARCH AND DISPERSION OF THE BLANKETEERS — TREASONABLE PLOT — JOSEPH HEALEY, THE DOCTOR; HIS OBSERVATIONS AND DISCOVERIES IN THE WELKIN.

Soon afterwards I left the great Babylon, heartily tired of it, and returned to Middleton, where events rapidly pressed on my attention.

On the morning of Sunday, the 8th of March, Benbow called on me at Middleton. I had lost sight of him since my return from London ; the Habeas Corpus Act was already suspended, and I supposed from some remarks of his that he had thought it best not to be so much in public at Manchester as he previously had been. He had, however, taken a great share in getting up and arranging the Blanket Meeting ; and now, after commending the intended proceeding, and dwelling on the good effects it would produce, he asked me to join in the meeting and expedition, and to bring as many of my neighbours as I could. I flatly refused; and stated my reasons, which will shortly appear. He enlarged his commendations, calculating with certainty that the Blanketeers would march to London, thousands in number ; and that their petitions would be graciously, if not with some awe, received by the Prince Kegent in person. I maintained my opinions — he answered with reproaches ; I treated the plan as a chimera, and held lightly the judgment of its proposers and concoctors, Benbow went away in a huff, and I remained with a lowered opinion of my former comrade.

On the night of Sunday, the 9th of March, I was requested to attend a meeting in the house of one of my neighbours, where a number of friends wished to hear my opinion with reference to the Blanket Meeting. I went to them and spoke freely in condemnation of the measure. I endeavoured to show them that the authorities of Manchester were not likely to permit their leaving the town in a body, with blankets and petitions, as they proposed ; that they could not subsist on the road ; that the cold and wet would kill numbers of them, who were already enfeebled by hunger and other deprivations ; that soldiers always marched in divisions for the easier procurement of food and lodgings ; and that an irregular multitude like themselves, could not, on an emergency, be provisioned, and quartered. That they need not expect to be welcome wherever they went, especially in such of the rotten boroughs as fell in their way, against the franchise of which they were petitioning ; that the inhabitants would bolt their doors against them ; and that if they took possession by force there was the law to punish them. That many persons might join their ranks who were not reformers but enemies to reform, hired perhaps to bring them and their cause into disgrace ; that if these persons began to plunder on the road, the punishment and disgrace would be visited on the whole body ; that they would be denounced as robbers and rebels, and the military would be brought to cut them down or take them prisoners. In conclusion, I earnestly cautioned them against having anything to do with the proposed meeting, and intimated that the parties who had got it up were not to be depended upon ; that their blind zeal overran every reasonable consideration ; and that if they, my neighbours, took part in the meeting, they would probably repent when it was too late. Whether it was in consequence of what I said I cannot tell ; but I was afterwards gratified on hearing that no person from Middleton went as a Blanketeer.

But of this meeting, which was our first great absurdity, I must write more particularly.

It was one of the bad schemes which accompanied us from London, and was the result of the intercourse of some of the deputies with the leaders of the London operatives — the Watsons, Prestons, and Hoopers. Mitchell and Benbow had cultivated a rather close acquaintance with these men, little suspecting, I have no doubt, that their new friends had already fallen under the influence of instigators who betrayed all their transactions to the Government. But the London leaders, or at least such of them as I conversed with, were, as I have shown, men of frank character and bearing, and apparently of sincere intention ; and their manner, flattering by the confidence it bestowed, naturally led to a reciprocal feeling, and to the formation of connections, the effects of which now began to appear.

Our maxim had hitherto in all our proceedings been— " Hold fast by the laws." It was the maxim of Major Cartwright, our venerable political father, and had been adhered to with a religious observance. But doctrines varying from this now began to be broached, and measures hinted, which, if not in direct contravention of the law, were but ill-disguised subterfuges for evading its intentions.

The meeting took place according to appointment ; but I not being there, my brief description must be taken as the account of others. The assemblage consisted almost entirely of operatives, four or five thousand in number ; and was held on that piece of ground (St. Peter's Field) which afterwards obtained so melancholy a celebrity. Many of the individuals were observed to have blankets, rugs, or large coats, rolled up and tied, knapsack like, on their backs ; some carried bundles under their arms ; some had papers, supposed to be petitions rolled up ; and some had stout walking sticks. The magistrates came upon the field and read the Riot Act `[TH: newspaper reports do not say the Riot Act was read.]` ; the meeting was afterwards dispersed by the military and special constables, and twenty-nine persons were apprehended, amongst whom were two young men, named Bagguley and Drummond, who had recently come into notice as speakers, and who being in favour of extreme measures, were much listened to and applauded. But my warm friend, Benbow, took care not to make his appearance on that occasion.

On the Riot Act being read, about three hundred persons left the meeting to commence their march to London. Some of them formed a straggling line in Mosley Street, and marched along Piccadilly, being continually joined by others, until the whole body was collected, near Ardwick Green. The appearance of these misdirected people was calculated to excite in considerate minds pity rather than resentment. Some appeared to have strength in their limbs and pleasure in their features, others already with doubt in their looks and hesitation in their steps. A few were decently clothed and well appointed for the journey; many were covered only by rags which admitted the cold wind, and were already damped by a gentle but chilling rain. Some appeared young, with health on their cheeks, every care behind and hope alone before ; the thoughts of others were probably reverting to their homes on the hill- sides, or in the sombre alleys of the town, where wives and children had resigned them for a time, in hopes of their return with plenty, and never more to part. Here a youth was waving his hand to a damsel pale and tremulous with alarm ; yonder an attenuated being, giving back, after kissing it, a poorly child to the arms of its mother— he hastens towards his comrades with willing but feeble steps, looking back on those, so poor, but oh ! how dear —— the child is hushed with a caress, the mother turning it gently to her cold and nurtureless bosom, nurtureless of everything save deep and tender love. Her looks are still directed the way he goes ; he has disappeared : and whilst her tears flow the poor but cleanly mantle is drawn over the little one, and in a conflict of grief, hope, and fear, she thoughtfully wends to her obscure and cheerless abode. A body of yeomanry soon afterwards followed those simple-minded men, and took possession of the bridge at Stockport. Many then turned back to their homes ; a body of them crossed the river below, and entered Cheshire ; several received sabre wounds, and one man was shot dead on Lancashire hill. Of those who persisted in their march it is only necessary to say that they arrived at nine o'clock at night in the market place at Macclesfield, being about one hundred and eighty in number. Some of them lay out all night, and took the earliest dawn to find their way home. Some were well lodged and hospitably entertained by friends ; some paid for quarters, and some were quartered in prison. Few were those who marched the following morning. About a score arrived at Leek, and six only were known to pass Ashborne bridge. And so ended the Blanket Expedition! 'What would you really have done," I said to one of them, ' sup- posing you had got to London?" "Done?" he replied, in surprise at the question; "why iv wee'd nobbo gett'n to Lunnun, we shud ha' tan th' nation, an' sattl't o'th dett." Such, and about as rational, were some of the incoherent dreams which at this time began to find favour in the eyes of the gross multitude.

But another cause was assigned for the dispersion of the Blanketeers. It was said that a purse containing from thirty to fifty pounds having been made up, was. given to one of the principal leaders, with instructions to proceed on the London road a day or two in advance, to procure food and lodgings for money, where they could not be had for friendship or a more urgent motive. That " the good man," by some mistake, got out of the right way, and wandering far into Yorkshire, he never found himself till the money was all spent ; and the Blanketeers, thus losing their commissary and paymaster, were broken by the same means which had dispersed more numerous armies, viz., want of necessaries; and thus " the nation " was saved for that time. However true or otherwise this account may be, it is certain that the man suddenly disappeared (but others did the same) and was out of the way a month or two, after which he paid a visit to Middleton on his return, as he said, from Yorkshire to Manchester. He was always somewhat doubted afterwards ; and his last appearance in this quarter was in the character of an adroit crimp to a fortune-promising attorney.
