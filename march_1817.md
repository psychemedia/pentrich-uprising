Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 11 March 1817

The Manchester Mercury, Tuesday, March 11, 1817.

The lenient moderation of the magistracy has at length eked out the fullest extent of forbearance compatible with the protection which is due to the persons and property of the peaceable and well-disposed part of the community. We find it was among the notifications at the meeting on the 3d inst. near St. Peter's Church, corroborated, in the course of last week, by the declarations individuals who have been actively engaged in promoting the late seditious meetings, that the espousers of their doctrines should collect at the same place the Monday following (yesterday), and proceed to the Metropolis, at nine o'clock, to present a petition to the Prince Regent, that they might be enabled *"to undeceive him ! "* Aware of these intentions, and of the dangers which an immense influx of strangers, irritated by the inflammatory appeals of their factious leaders, (who, under the pretence of promoting Parliamentary Reform, have been for a length of time agitating the minds of the labouring class of society), portended, the conservators ofthe public tranquillity took every precaution adequate to the occasion.

Yesterday morning, according to the expectations entertained, crowds of people flocked into town from all directions, as early as eight o'clock, and at about nine, the instigators appeared on their temporary stage in cart, and continued to harangue the multitude till their vast increasing numbers suggested the expediency of putting into practice the well-formed arrangements of the civil and military powers. Accordingly, a party of the first Regiment of Dragoons, under Colonel Teesdale, accompanied by the Magistrates of the District, appeared amongst them, and with adroitness and decision almost electrical, surrounded tbe erection, and immediately conveyed the entire group upon it to the New Bayley Prison ; their attention was next directed to the concourse of auditors, who were forthwith dispersed, without the infliction of any severity.

An arrest had taken place early on Sunday morning, of Johnson and Ogden, who had previously figured at this place, and they were secured in the New Bayley. Others were seized by the soldiers on their way to deliver their charge in Salford. The following are the names of prisoners : Drummond, Baguley, (the two orators), Handring, Grimshaw, Lingard, Quiney, Shaw, Wood, Hargraves, Lever, Shawcross, two Williamses, Tucker, Whitworth, Oddey, Bousfield, Kay, Lefgar, Blackshaw, Simms, Thomason, Barlow, Cuthbird, Lees, Hudson, and Higginbotham, (the owner of the cart on which the stage was fixed).

A considerable number of people set out on their mission to London, taking the route of Stockport, but about forty of them were reconducted to Manchester, and added to their other unfortunate companions; others were furnished secure accommodations in Stockport. Most of them were provided with knapsacks, &c. containing blankets and other articles. Upon the examination of some of these travelling equipages, two unusually large knives were discovered.

Johnston, Ogden, &c. will be dispatched, without loss of time, under escort, to the Secretary of State, in London.

We shall desist from entering further at present into the cases of there characters, as they will probably hereafter be the subject High Judicial Enquiry.

The military preparations were under the direction of Sir John Byng, the commander of the district, who arrived in Manchester on Sunday. A party of the Regiment of Foot were present to render their assistance.

We may fairly presume that at one period there was an assemblage of at least thirty thousand at the meeting ; and believe we not over-rate the arrivals in the course of the day at from sixty to seventy thousand individuals.

No particular act of outrage or intemperance has yet reached our ears, and we cannot help feeling highly indebted to the judicious and salutary interposition of the respective authorities for the satisfatory result of this day's transactions. As we are closing this account, we have authority to state, that the apprehensions are nothing short of *two hundred* persons.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 15 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 11.

After the meeting of the Reformers broke up on Monday the 3rd inst. we heard amongst a variety of reports as to the result of their deliberations, a vague indistinct story of a motion to meet again on the following Monday (yesterday), prepared with blankets to proceed to London, to lay their sufferings and their petitions before the Prince Regent, whom it seems, they (all or other) professed to hold in high respect and veneration, whilst the most vile and approbious epithets were levelled at his Mnisters. During the week, the blanket story gained ground; and a report of sixty thousand Scottish Reformers being on their way towards London, and that they had even advanced as far as Preston, was prevalent; whilst accounts of individual preparation tor the intended march, continually met the ear. There were many persons, however, who did not put any faith in the "often told tale" till Saturday last, when a placard of which the following is a copy, was exhibited on the walls of this town and its neighbourhood:—

"PUBLIC MEETING

"The Inhabitants of MANCHESTER and its vicinity are respectfully informed that a PUBLIC MEETING regarding to adjournement, will be held near St Peter's Church on Monday morning the 10th of March 1817, when it is hoped that every person who is determined to carry his Petition to London, will assemble peaceably and orderly, and provide himself with the necessary means of support requisite to bear him through this loyal and necessary undertaking.

"It is hoped that these friends of Parliamentary Reform, who possess the means, will come forward on this important occasion.

"Persons will be appointed to receive contributions this evening at New Islington, and at the meeting on Monday. W OGDEN, Printer, 28 Wood Street."

Still we should have been sceptical in respect of the report of the intention of the intamated people to proceed to London and should have thought the foregoing placard the result of a determination of some one to laugh at credulity, if it had not been the imprint of a person who had distinguished himself on the cart at all the preceding meetings, by haranguing the gaping gulls who surroundd the temporary alter of sedition. His oratorical labours are however suspended but early on Sunday morning, he was arrested in his bed, and conveyed to the New Bailey Prison, nearly at the same time with one Johnstone, a tailor (the Missionary who was dispatched by the Lancashire Reformers to convert the Staffordshire Potters to the new political faith); who we are told, has distinguished himself in this neighbourhood for several months past, as one of the most violent of demagogues who have endeavoured to make the working classes subservient to the too evident design of disorganizing society, and destroying the Constitution.

That many persons, willing to labour, have lately wanted employment. we believe: and that of this description some would be found at poltical meetings; but we also believe, that by far a greater number who are too idle for labour for their bread and who wish for an easier, or rather more luxurious life, swelled their numbers. Both these descriptions are able to be misled by designing orators; and are easily hurried on by the impulsive stream, put in motion by the bad spirits who join mobs of all kinds, in the hope that the consequent bustle will afford opportunity for the exercise of their callings, to plunder, to rob and to murder. Such men are ready to *practice*, and by example, instruct others to practice the doctrine, which the mouth pieces of such meetings *recommend*. They labour for the equalization of property; and like the vultures who hover over contending armies in the hope of a gluttonous feast on the fallen carcases, they look forward to the glorious time of anarchy, which they anticipate as the reward their present patient attendance on the labour of excitement. Mixed in the crowd, they second the views of the designing men, who, under the plausible pretence of helping the poor and the ignorant to their rights, make them pay for their own undoing. That the poison thus poured into the minds of the unthinking has begun to operate is too evident, whenever a decently dressed person, walking out, finds himself in the vicinity of the lower orders of society. The remarks addressed *at*, if not *to* him — as to the sources of his prosperity - that it was the result of the labour of the poor—that all would come round again soon—that it will be their turn next! &c &c. prove the operation of the deleterious principles which have been poured into the ears of the working classes of society. A Reform in Parliament is but a cry at the present time, used by many to hide the deep design of general devastation. To ignorance, to idleness, and improvidence, the doctrine of the Spenceans, by whatever name it is called, has great charms. No wonder it has many votaries. Men acting under such influence  are easily persuaded that the richer part of society are enjoying the fruits of the labour of the poor; that their rulers are their oppressors; and that the wholesome laws of restriction which Parliament, with paternal care, has enacted are acts of tyranny. Can it then be wondered at, that designing men should find tools to work with?

By the placard which we have quoted, it will be seen that a preparatory meeting, for levying pecuniary means to carry the resolution of last Monday into execution was held on Saturday evening at New Islington, Salford and we understand that other preparatory meetings were held yesterday morning, very early, at Middleton, Oldham &c. to instruct men (so systematic are the proceedings of organized disaffection) as to their conduct at the Manchester meeting, on their proposed march to London, and their junction with their brother reformers in Spa-fields.

A crowd began to gather on the ground in front of the Quaker's Meeting-house, before nine o'clock yesterday morning, and a table, elevated on a cart, was used by a person to write a register of the names of the poor, infatuated wretches who declared their intention to proceed to London, and to receive money, subscribed by the less zealous, or more infirm votaries of delusion, in aid of the volunteers. At half-past nine the number of persons on the ground amounted to at least ten thousand, soon after which, a leader of the multitude (whose name we could not learn) came to the field in a hackney-coach out of which he stepped and mounted the cart.

TO DO
 He was received with huzzas; but we were pleased to observe, that, the cheers did not proceed from the bulk of the assembly, and only from a few of the more insane (not amounting to more than three or four hundred at the most) who held up and waved their hats. The greatest praise is due to the care and foresight of the Magistrates and the Boroughreeves and Constables of Manchester and Salford for the precautionary steps thev took. A great number of additional constables had been sworn in, and soon after ten o'clock they proceeded to the neighbourhood of the meeting, from whence about a thousand men, provided with blankets and such provision as they could make, had withdrawn a short time before, to Piccadilly, from whence they set out, soon after on the mad scheme of marching to London. 
 A little before eleven o'clock, whilst the Orators were displaying their eloquence in the brick-field, using the most inflammatory language on the one hand, and the greatest persuasion on, the other, to induce the silly people who surrounded the cart to contribute bountifully towards defraying the expences of the blanketeers during their expedition, the preparation the legal authorities was complete, and the Magistrates, the Municipal Officers; and the Special Constables, and four troops of cavalry from the barracks, (under the direction of Sir John Byng, the Commander of the District) simultaneously, by a most happy execution of the prepared design, surrounded the seditious hustings, and took all the orators and their papers into custody. Amongst the former was a man the name of Drummond, provided with a new great coat &c to head the column of petitioners who had just before left the ground, and another leader of the name of Baguley. The sweep was instantaneously compleated and the exciters to mischief were immediately marched away, prisoners, under a strong escort, to the New Bailey Prison. Whilst the crowd gave way to apprehensions for personal safety, and dispersed, a detachment of the peace officers, under the direction of Magistrates who accompanied them, immediately
 after the ringleaders were secured, led a troop of cavalry after the migratory reformers, who had set out on their way to London, in the expectation of being overtaken very soon by their leaders, bringing with them the money which inuiUuttion had subscribed (we understand to a considerable amount) on the field. The stragglers were overtaken, and many were secured before they had arrived at Longsight; but at Stockport Bridge, the cavalry surrounded a great number, all fami.,lied for hivoaaeiogâand some, if the knives found in their knapsacks., indicated any thhing for other purposes, who were made prisoners. Upwards of two hundred were brought to New Bayley Prison in the afternoon. Before we close the account of the proceedings of the day, it is a duty to state, that a detachment of the 54th regiment of foot was under arms, in the vicinity of the meeting, but were not called upon to act; and that the Cheshire Yoemanry Cavalry were under arms all day in various parts of that county and a detachment of several troops, evinced their zeal and entitled them to the thanks of their country, by their services in Manchester, where they volunteered their assistance; many of them having marched at least thirty miles yesterday for that purpose.In the course of the day, a part of the 55th regiment of foot marched into town, but we are happy to state that there is no appearance of their being any necessity for any thing more than the impression of their presence. In the course of the evening, Johnstone, Ogden, Baguley and Drummond, who were, we understand, arrested by virtue of warrants from the Secretary of State's Office, were, we believe, sent off under a proper guard to London. The town is now at peace and free from alarm.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 22 March 1817

MANCHESTER, MARCH 18. A number of the designing or deluded persons about Manchester have been apprehended and conveyed the Castle of Chester, addition to tiiose mentioned apprehended last week and committed to the New Bailey, Manchester. They were apprehended at Norris, and are charged the commitment with treasonable and seditious practices. They appeared to a wretched set individual, and two them mere youths. The Chester papers state that Pike-heads, and numbers of heavy sticks, containing a kind daggers, about eight inches long, have been found Stockport. Several of the. deluded men were cut in the face in opposing the cavalry. The are represented have made very ludicrous appearance; many them having their bedfilankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks haversacks, had large bundles attached to tlieii shoulders n.ilitaire. Many of them swam several rivers elude the civil and military power waiting at bridges to intercept them. A Manchester paper Tuesday says, " the number unfortunate objects confined in our prison exceeded 2.j0, whom have been examined by W.D. Evans fy;d whom have been discharged, and committed for want securities." is well known fact, that Evening Meetings have been held for long time past, at least twice a week, which persons have been admitted indiscriminately, i:i ]«rge old Spinning Factory, New Islington, j.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 01 April 1817

The Blanketeers' Petition.

The following it a copy of the Petition which Malcontents were to carry forward to the Prince Regent, from the press of tbe State Prisoner Odden:—

THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED, INHABITANTS MANCHESTER,IN THE COUNTV OF LANCASTER,

*Humbly Sheweth,*

" That your Petitioners, before the last war, neither felt nor feared either difficulties or privations; but during the continuance have frequently experienced both, and have repeatedly applied to your Royal Father, your Royal Highness, and the House of Commons, for redress, which applications, we are sorry to say, have in our humble, but firm, belief, not received that attention which their importance merited; so that now, when the waste of war is over, our sufferings are become both more general and deeper than ever.

" This state of things, we, your Petitioners, attribute to the rapid increase of taxation, which has been quadrupled, together with the increase of rent, which has probably, been doubled during the war; which, tohether so nearly absorb the whole produce of the kingdom, as to leave a quantity very far short of being sufficient to keep your Petitioners in existence, and therefore their lives are now become a burden and a plague to them ; your distressed Petitioners are further convinced, that if the House of Commons had really emanated from, and been wholly and annually appointed by, the People at large, this war, and the taxation resulting therefrom, would long ago have received a sufficient check, even admitting the nation have sanctioned its commencement— that the laws to regulate the importation of corn, calculated to advance its price, would never have been suffered to pass—that the law of libel, which subjects the publishers of truth in some instances to great pains and penalties, thereby preventing the publication of the most important truths, could never have received the sanction of the friends of truth and mankind— that a Bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, a Bill empowering Ministers to imprison, without proof of guilt, whomsoever they please, and for an unknown length time—could never have passed.

"Your Petititioners therefore humbly, but fervently, pray, that your Highness will instantly dismiss from your Councils all those Ministers who have advised or devised such cruel, such unjust measures, and call to your Councils even who are the declared or avowed friends to conciliatory measures—to Parliamenetary Reform— and a general and very considerableretrenchment in every part of national expenditure. Our lives are in your hans—our happiness, in great measure, depends on you. °If you procure the adoption of measures calculated to relieve us, you may then safely rely upon our support and gratitude°— WITHOUT THIS< WE CAN NEITHER SUPPORT YOU NOR OURSELVES. Your gracious attention to our prayers will gain you eternal esteem and gratitude of your Petitioners, who will ever pray."

The Scotsman - Saturday 12 April 1817

The following Circular has been issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department .

( COPY)— Circular— *Whitehall , March* 27 . 1817 .

My Lord , —As it is of the greatest importance to prevent as far as possible the circulation of Blasphemous and Seditious Pamphlets and Writings, of which, for a considerable time past, great numbers have been sold and distributed throughout the country; I have thought it my duty to consult the Law Officers of the Crown, whether an individual found selling, or in any way publishing such Pamphlets or Writings might be brought immediately before a Justice of the Peace, under a warrant issued for the purpose, to answer for his conduct. The Officers having accordingly taken this matter into their consideration, have notified to me their opinion, That a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged before him upon oath, with the publication of Libels of the nature in question, and compel him to give bail to answer the charge. Under these circumstances, I beg leave to call your Lordship's attention very particularly to this subject; and I have to request, that if your Lordship should not propose to attend in person at the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden in and for the county under your Lordship's charge, you would make known to the Chairman of such Sessions the substance of this communication, in order that he may recommend to the several Magistrates to act thereupon in all cases where any person should be found offending against the law in the manner above mentioned. I beg leave to add, that persons vending Pamphlets or other Publications, in the manner alluded to, should be considered as coining under the provisions of the Hawker's and Pedlar's Act, and be dealt with accordingly, unless they shew that they are furnished, with a License, as required by the said Act. I am, &c. SIDMOUTH.

To his Majesty's Lieutenant in the county of _____.

[TH: we might also note furrther down the page, the following report: *By accounts received from Leicester we learn that eight of the Luddites, tried at that town , have_been capitally convicted , and received sentence of death . A ninth ( JOHN SLATER ) has been convicted under the Frame-breaking Act , and sentenced to transportation for life . The tenth was seized with convulsion fits during his trial , and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence , was remanded to prison .*]
