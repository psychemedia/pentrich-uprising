<p>In the first quarter of 1812, frame breaking was to continue in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, although I will not be  including reports of most of those events here. My intention in this section is more to describe those actions that impacted on a certain Mr. Benjamin Topham.</p>
<p>It is, however, perhaps worth noting that reports of the actions in Nottingahmshire and Derbyshire continued to appear in the <em>Leeds Mercury</em>. Who knows to what extent these reports might have helped motivate or inspire the men who would lead the machine breaking activities in West Yorkshire, and particularly in Huddersfield, in that first quarter of 1812?</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 01 February 1812</p>
<p>RIOTS IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE. <em>(From the Review of Friday last.)</em> In recording the depredations of the frame-breakers, we have been led to hope each succeeding week would terminate these ever to be lamented transactions. In this, however, we have been mistaken; for each succeeding week has hitherto been accompanied by succeeding crimes, and our present records present a scene not less lamentable than the one given in our last; and prove that neither the vigilance of police officers, the terror of the military, nor even the impending penalties of the law, are sufficient to suppress this spirit of revolt. It is with pleasure we state that one reputable house in this town (Wm. Nunn and Co.) have publicly announced that they have taken off all the frame rent, and are giving the full prices. This conduct, if followed by other manufacturers, will, we trust, soon restore peace and harmony in the town and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On Saturday night one frame was broken in this town; and the following evening four were destroyed at New Radford, one of which was supposed to be the completest silk frame in existence; and, we understand, was then employed in making an order of stockings for the Prince Regent. On this case we are desired by the holder of these frames to state that he had worked in the finest of these frames for twenty years; during which time he has continued to receive the same price, and marked the stockings with the proper marks. On the same night two or three frames were broken at Ruddington, nine of the warp lace kind at Limby, all of great value, and all employed in making the two-course-hole net. At the last mentioned place the people had an expectation that a visit would be paid them, and a number had agreed to watch for the approach of their nocturnal visitors, which they did till midnight, at which time, imagining all the danger was over, they dispersed, and went to their respective homes. This was no sooner done, than the framebreakers made their appearance: fourteen of them entered the house of Mr. Shipley, and in ten minutes completed their work. The damage is estimated at 200l. and upwards. On the same night, seven plain cotton frames at Cotmanhay, in the parish of Ilkiston; and, if our information be correct, eleven of the latter description were destroyed at Swanwick: the two latter towns are in Derbyshire.</p>
<p>At ten o’clock this morning we received the disagreeable intelligence, that 22 frames were last night broken at Lenton. About 50 men entered the village, armed in various ways; and while the mischief was going on, every pass in the village was guarded. One man, who was passing with a loaf of bread, was stopped by them, and compelled to stand sentry himself, with a bar of iron in his hand, with an order to give the alarm if any one approached, or otherwise to have his brains blown out. The man who ran to Nottingham to inform the soldiers, had a narrow escape; one of the frame-breakers running after him, vociferating the most horrid vengeance if he caught him. The man escaped, and so did the depredators. The names of the persons at whose houses the frames are broken, with the number at each house, are as follows :-Five at G. Ball’s, four of which, he has informed us, were his own property, and were working at full price; eight at Thos. Selby’s; one at Wm. Selby’s, and pulled the jack-wires out of another two at Jos Shepherd’s; one at ——— Taylor’s; one at John Barnes’s; one at Ann Taylor’s; and two at Wm. Burton’s. After they had done, they fired three pistols. What adds to the audacity of this affair is, that Lenton, is only about a quarter of a mile from the barracks, and one from Nottingham.</p>
</div>
<p>As well as editorial comment, the <em>Nottingham Journal</em> also provided a platform for correspondents seeking to explain the causes of the troubles, call the manufacturers to come together to find a solution, and have the mischief makers put to justice.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 15 February 1812</p>
<p>TO THE PUBLIC.</p>
<p>As there is reason to apprehend, that the calm which we have for a few days enjoyed in this great manufacturing district, is rather a suspension than an entire cessation of outrages; that the perverse mind still exists, though somewhat restrained by power; I venture to express my sentiments, on a subject so interesting to our peace and happiness.</p>
<p>The exteniive hostilities in which this country is engaged; and the exclusion of our manufactures from a great part of the Continent of Europe, have so much reduced the consumption of them, as to have occasioned unusual compettition in the sale, and a consequent reduction in the price of our articles of commerce. The merchant is induced to endeavour to indemnify himself by manufacturing the goods at a cheaper rate. If the payment to the Manufacturer were not more than a sufficient compensation for his labour before such reduction, he will suffer and complain; and may redress the grievances which he may experience in any peaceable and legal manner. The Hosiery and Lace Manufactures, which have been so extensively established in this and the neighbouring counties, have partaken in the general depression of trade; and the opppression of some, and the daring and felonious conduct of others, have increased the distress, and surrounded us with danger and alarm. It may be well to retrace our steps, to examine what has been done amiss, and to search for a remedy, as calm and impartial spectators, influenced only by a regard to what is fair, honourable, and good.</p>
<p>The Masters dismissed some of their workmen, and they were justified by necessity: some reduced their prices; the act was legal: but it was peculiarly cruel and unkind, at a period when the necessaries of life required an increased expenditure; it was also unavailing, because it was not the objection of price, but the want of demand, which had injured the trade; others took away the rack, an instrument by which the quantity of certain work might be ascertained; it may be presumed, that they required more than was due, as they removed the standard of their just claim. What was necessary,can only be lamented; what was cruel, mut be censured; and what was unjust, must be condemned.</p>
<p>Many of the Manufacturers found out other employments, receiving also reasonable assistance from their parishes, and quietly acquiesced in the deprivation of many of many of their usual comforts: they are to be pitied, and will have their reward in their own approving consciences, and in the season of Final Retribution. Others have required their Masters to manufacture articles, for which they had no demand; have issued threatening letters; have associated in large bodies, and, armed and disguised, have broken into houses, have destroyed stocking and lace frames, filled the country with terror, and, by their felonious conduct, forfeited their lives to the offended laws. They have increased the general misery, by depriving many of their means of employment; and have injured the common labourer by creating for him new competitors. They will probably drive away the trade to remote parts of the kingdom, where men, of better principles and conduct, know and practice their duty to society.</p>
<p>Amidst all this confusion, the Master Manufacturers have been either timid or supine; they have not, as is usual on similar occasions, entered into any subscription; nor in general taken any active measores for preserving their property, or bringing to justice those who injured it.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the duty of the different orders of society is,— for those employed as Manufacturers to lay aside their unreasonable desire for that work which is not wanted; to deplore the mischief which they have done; and to come to commit outrages and felonies, which defy all decency, law, and religion, place the country in a state of terror; lead to a habit of committing the most atrocious crimes, and must be punished with the heaviest visitation of Justice.</p>
<p>The Master Manufacturers ought not to make unreasonable abatements of wages; the poor and industrious are deserving of their compassion; they are not to be treated with harshness, and cruelty; and all injustice to them must have the indignation of the good, and the anger of heaven.</p>
<p>All, whether rich or poor, are deeply interested in restoring and maintaining the public traniquility. The mischief, if not speedily suppressed, will not confine itself to its present form, but will endanger the lievs and property all. Great numbers have been already deprived of their ordinary means of subsistence by the pretended friends, but truly the bitterest enemies of the lower order of society. It is, therefore, the duty and the interest of all to assist the Civil Power in detecting and apprehending offenders; to support the Magistrates in their exertions to restore tranquillity; to fear no danger in the cause of law and justice, and peace; but boldly to resist such outrages as have a tendency to produce insurrection, anarchy, and the worst of tyranny.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 March 1812
We understand, that not withstanding the pending severities of the law upon the frame-breakers, ten frames were broken and totally demolished, at Pentrich, on Saturday night last; and on Tuesday night last, the iron work of one narrow stocking frame was stolen and completely carried off from a house, situated on the Parson’s Flat, at Basford, near this town.</p>
</div>
<p>They  were also nothing if not persistent. For once again, we see them attacking the frames of Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentridge.</p>
<p>The report in the <em>Leeds Mercury</em>, which seems to have a been a widely syndiacted item, appears to suggest that Topham may have been pressing for those involved in frame breaking to be brought to justice, or perhaps he had been involved in a Jury sitting against them?, and that his frames being targeted again was the result.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14` March 1812</p>
<p>The depredations of the Machine-breakers, in the West-Riding of this county, we are sorry to find are still continued. The following is a copy of a letter from our Correspondent at Huddersfield, dated March 12:—</p>
<p>“In the last week, (I think on Thursday night) four houses, near Slaithwaite, were entered by the Luddites, and the frames, shears, &amp;c. destroyed. The name of the owners I have not on the subject*. Threatening letters have been sent, of which you will soon learn the particulars.</p>
<p>“Last night, the houses of Mr. John Garner, of Honley; Mr. Clement Dyson, Dungeon, and Mr. Roberts, Crosland; were visit by the malcontents, and the obnoxious machinery destroyed. More troops are at this moment entering the town.”</p>
<p>“Nottingham, March 9.—” Such is the apparent disposition, and systematic conduct of the frame breakers that, if a frame is once marked out for and destruction, its state may be said to be settled, except some step be taken by its possessor to remove the cause assigned for its condemnation; at least such are the conclusions we have a right to draw from what we daily see and hear. It has long formed a topic of conversation, that Mr. B. Topham, of Pentridge, in Derbyshire, had excited the hatred of the <em>Luddites</em>, by his activity in attempting to bring some of them to justice, in consequence of several frames being broken in his shop some time ago; and, on Saturday night last, his property became an object of their vengeance; for a party of men entered his dwelling and demolished seven pointnet lace, and three plain hose frames. I am likewise informed, that a man and his wife, who are the chief evidence against a person of the name of <em>Elliot</em>, now confined in Derby Gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, likewise felt the effects of their fury; and only escaped with their lives on condition of promising not to swear against the man.”</p>
</div>
<p>In the <em>London Chronicle</em>, we learn a few more details of the attack, and again the implication it was personally motivated, for the work on the machines, as well as the fabric of his house, were damaged, as well as the frames.</p>

London Chronicle - Monday 16 March 1812</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM RIOTS. The Nottingham Papers state, that the Commission of Assize had been opened in the Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bayley, after complimenting the Magistrates on the smallness of the Calendar, observed, that in the two cases of frame-breaking, “that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital.” No outrage had been committed by the frame-breakers within the last few days. The ten frames broken yesterday se’nnight, at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, belonging to Mr. Topham, were in full work. The violence appears to have been owing to personal spleen, as the silk and lace pieces about the frames were much injured, his doors and windows all broken to pieces, and his own life menaced, while the violence was committing, by a number of armed men without. Mr. Topham for a short time concealed himself in a closet.</p>
</div>
<p>Another argument in favour of personal malice being involved in the attack comes from the claim that the frames were being worked “at full price”. The following report, which also appeared in several other London papers, also recaps on Topham’s previous encounters with the Luddites.</p>

Statesman (London) - Monday 16 March 1812</p>
<p>Nottingham<br />
March 13</p>
<p>The Commission of Assize has just been opened in our Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect:— His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the Calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter</p>
<p>On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame-breaking only, <em>and no other damage had been done</em>, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage bad been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the Prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the Prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.</p>
<p>It has been asserted in the House of Commons by Mr. Wynne, and supported by Mr. John Smith, that the Frame-breaking Bill has already had a bad effect, by partly closing up the channels of private Information against the perpetrators. If this is really the case, what good, we would ask, is to be expected from its influence? for its terrors have not had the effect of stopping the breaking of frames. If, however, these observations should fall into the hands of the misguided men alluded to, we most earnestly hope that they will take a timely hint, and cease from their destructive and dangerous practices. For, independent of the disquietude such conduct must give to every man’s mind, who is concerned in it, on account of the danger of detection, most assured we are that its further prosecution will be attended with the most fatal consequences to the future prosperity of this town and neighbourhood. May our solicitations in this respect not be made is vain!</p>
<p>On Saturday night, seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of Benjamin Topham, of that place; and, what makes the case peculiarly distressing is, the lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25<em>l.</em> each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the framebreakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of this town, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven them away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces, about the frames, received considerable injury. What frames were at work, were employed on double press net, and at the full price; therefore, the fair conclusion is, that the violence had its origin in personal spleen; which, according to his own declaration, as far as his knowledge goes, has been raised against him without any cause whatsoever. The same night two frames were broken at Losco, about four miles on this side Pentridge; and on Tuesday night, one was carried clean away from Basford.</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure whether Benjamin Topham had been involved in making the broken machines himself, but he certainly seems to have paid for them, 25<em>l.</em> being the claimed cost of repairing them.</p>

London Chronicle - Friday 20 March 1812 Topham frames broken</p>
<p>DERBYSHIRE RIOTS.— On Saturday night the 7th inst. seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of B. TOPHAM, of that place; and, what makes the same peculiarly distressing is, these lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25<em>l.</em> each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the frame-breakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace-frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of Nottingham, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven the offenders away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces about the frames received considerable injury. On the same night, a man and his wife, at Swanwick, who are expected to be the principle evidences against two persons confined in Derby gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, were visited, as it is supposed, by the same party, who assailed their dwelling broke their furniture to pieces, and in some degree injured their persons. They have been removed to Derby as a place of safety. The same night two frames were broken at Losca; and on Tuesday night one was carried away from Basford.</p>

<p>In passing, this paragraph from the <em>Hampshire Chronicle</em> estimates the nu,mber of frames of various sorts broken to date, along with their typical cost.</p>

Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 16 March 1812</p>
<p>It appears that since the commencement of the <em>Luddite</em> system, in the neighbourhood of Nottingham, 42 lace-frames, 544 plain silk frames and cotton stocking frames have been destroyed: the value of the former, when new, is, upon the average, about 60l. each; and that of the latter from 18 to 20l. each.</p>

<h2>Nottingham Assizes, March 1812<a class="headerlink" href="#nottingham-assizes-march-1812" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>At the March Assizes in Nottingham, the presiding judge noted two frame breaking cases on to the list, inclduing one that took place at Old Basford on January 3rd, 1812. Also up for trial were two defendancts charged with the burglaries at Lockbrook Mill and Ocko Grange, on December 21st, which may have appeared to take a similar form to the Ludding attacks, at least at first, but quickly transpired to be more directly criminal enterprises.</p>

<p>In the matter of Carnel and Maples, frames were clearly broken, and the capital charge of burglary essentially dropped, which possibly helped secure both convictions, rather than just one. Although alibis were provided, the Judge cast doubt on their reliablity as part of his summing up, on the grounds that witnesses providing the alibis <em>“had measured the time rather by the occurrences of the evening, than by the accurate movements of a time-piece”</em>.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 March 1812</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM ASSIZES.</p>
<p>The Commission of Assize was opened in the Shire and Town Halls on Friday the 13th instant, when Mr. JUSTICE BAILEY addressed the Grand Jury to the following effect:—</p>
<p>His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter. On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, <em>and no other damage had been done</em>, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence were perfectly clear to their view of the question, they then would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a Petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.</p>
<p>Tuesday, March 17.</p>
<p>The Court was crowded to excess, by persons of all ranks, anxious to hear the trials of the prisoners confined on suspicion of Frame-breaking. Serjeant Vaughan and Mr. Reader, retained, in the first instance, as Counsel for the prisoners, had received an order from the Treasury to act as Counsel against them, and this order they obeyed.</p>
<p><em>William Carnel</em>, aged 22, and <em>Joseph Maples</em>, aged 16, both of Basford, were placed at the Bar, and pleaded not guilty. After an opening speech from Mr. Clarke,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Braithwaite, the first witness called, stated, that in Jan. last, she resided at Old Basford; that her husband, John Braithwaite was a stocking-maker, and at the time stated in the indictment, he kept seven plain cotton frames, which were occupied by five apprentices, one journeyman, of the name of Towlson, and himself. She further stated, that on the 3d of January, about ten minutes before eight in the evening, a person knocked at the door, and asked for Towlson; that the door was bolted; and, before she could open it, it was forced, and a man entered, whom she saw have hold of the outer handle of the door, he fell over a chair, and believes it was Carnel, mentioned in the indictment; that he walked into the shop with a hammer over his arm, and broke the end of a slur-bar; that eleven more entered after him; that the first man who entered stood as guard to the rest; and that one man whom she knew, and who used a hammer, is not yet taken. Here the witness was desired to look round the Court, and point the prisoner, Carnel, out. She turned round very attentively several times, and declared she could not see him, and that if he was there, he must have held down his head—thought his imprisonment would alter his appearance; but not so much as to prevent her from owning him, except he was disguised, <em>for she had known him from a child</em>. She was then ordered to mount the table in the centre of the Court, to try if by that means she could identify him—she did so, and after twice pacing it round, she pointed out a man who was mixed among the spectators, whose features she thought was like Carnel. She was then desired to look at one of the Sheriff’s officers, who stood near to Carnel, and give her opinion, <em>if that was the man</em>. On fixing her eyes closely upon that quarter, she pointed out the man; and said, “that is Carnel.” She was then asked whether she knew any other person near him, when she pointed to another in the prisoner’s box, and said, “that is Maples.” On being asked why she knew Carnel to be one of the men who had violated the premises of her husband, she said, that when the scuffle was going on in the shop, she called out for her husband to be brought out, and that Carnel (after having given her husband a nudge over the shoulder with a hammer, in consequence of which he had been lame ever since,) complied with her request; and that in the bustle the mask was pulled off his face, which she immediately recognized, though his cheeks and nose were blacked, and his upper-lip red. She knew Carnel by his voice, but dared not call him by his name; but that it was him, she had no doubt. Maples clapt a pistol to her breast, with this exclamation, “Dam you for a bitch, I will shoot you if you don’t hold your noise;” she seized the pistol, turned the muzzle towards his throat, and drew the trigger, and had it gone off it must have shot him; but believed it was not charged, because it struck fire without going off. While this was going on she heard some one call out, “My lads, work on!” which order she thought, was obeyed, as, she said, the hammers went like those in a smith’s shop. When the seven frames were broken, she stated that seven men went through the shop windows, and five out at the house door; among the latter of whom was Maples, who she saw charging a pistol after he went out; she had no other way of identifying his person than those above described. She stated the mischief to be done in 20 or 22 minutes, which makes the ending of the time 12 minutes after eight; and that Carnel returned in 20 minutes after on pretence of looking at the ruins; and said, if <em>Ned</em> had not done his work well, he was come to complete it; when she said, You rogue, are you come again? you are not the man you was some time ago; to which he replied, I have not been here before,—you have, said she, for I know you right well! She then said, that his head was wet, as if he had been washing himself; that black streaks were visible from his ears to his chin; and that she said, you have been to the upper pump to wash you, and you are not now disguised.</p>
<p>Nothing material came out on the cross-examination, except that witness had told a Mrs. Jackson, that one Wotton had first entered the house; but this she had done, as she said, to “gorge” Mrs Jackson, who was “pumping” her to tell tales.</p>
<p>The evidence of John Braithwaite, the next witness, was in substance the same as his wife’s, except that he did not profess to know anything of Maples’ person.</p>
<p>The prisoners were charged with burglary, for entering a dwelling-house, as the Judge said, after the light of heaven had ceased to enable one man to distinguish the features of another; and stealing thereout two files, one rasp, two pair of pliers, and a hand-vice, as well as for feloniously breaking the stocking-frames. But here Serjeant Rough put it as a question to the Judge, whether, to constitute a theft, the <em>intention</em> of thieving was not necessary to be proved? To this the Judge assented; and it was his opinion that the frame-breakers had no other object in view <em>than that of breaking frames</em>, he wished the Jury to divest their minds of that part of the charge which related to stealing the articles named above; in particular as nothing of the kind had been found upon the premises or persons of the prisoners.</p>
<p>John Griffin and ———— Burrows, two constables, deposed that they seized and searched Maples, on the 4th of January, and found upon his person a pistol and some flints, which were produced in Court. Mrs. Braithwaite, however, believed that the pistol then produced was not the one she had seen in the possession of Maples; and he said his father had lent it to him to shoot sparrows with some months ago, who had found it in a particular place in the parish of Wollaton, which he described.</p>
<p>The evidence on the part of the Crown being closed, the prisoners were called upon for their defence, when Carnel declared that Mrs. Braithwaite had made a different statement before the Magistrates at the time of his commitment to what she had done then, respecting his treatment of her husband at the time the frames were broken: and on her re-examination, she admitted that instead of Carnel “nudging” her husband with a hammer, he had, she believed, been the means of saving his life. The Judge noted this circumstance, and said it would stand in Carnel’s favor another day, providing he was then found guilty.</p>
<p>An <em>alibi</em> was positively sworn to both, on behalf of Maples and Carnel. Three witnesses deposed, that the former was in their presence, white-washing a house from 7 o’clock, on the evening mentioned in the indictment, till past 12 o’clock; and that he had never been off the premises. And four witnesses traced the time Carnel had been in their presence from half past 6, to a quarter before nine on the same night.</p>
<p>Here, with the exception of what related to character, which was much to the credit of both the prisoners, the whole of the evidence closed; and the learned Judge in delivering his charge to the Jury, stated, that notwithstanding the time had been apparently so connectively accounted for on the part of the prisoners, during the space in which the frames were stated to have been broken, yet it was very possible, for these persons to have been deceived in the time to the extent of 15 or 20 minutes, and especially in the case of Carnel, because they had measured the time rather by the occurrences of the evening, than by the accurate movements of a time-piece; and this rendered it very possible for them to have been at the scene of action.</p>
<p>After a patient hearing of six hours, the Jury returned a verdict of <em>Not Guilty</em> for Maples, and <em>Guilty of Frame-breaking</em> against Carnel; when his Lordship desired them to re-consider their verdict, and pointed out to them the impropriety of disuniting the burglarious entry into the house from the act of simple felony, occasioned by breaking the frames. All the alteration however, which the Jury chose to make, was that of uniting Maples with Carnel, and finding them both <em>Guilty of Frame-breaking only</em>, thus doing away the capital part of the charge.—The verdict being recorded, his Lordship addressed the prisoners in a most solemn and impressive manner. He deeply lamented, that two young men, whose character, till then, had stood unimpeached, should have so far forgotten their duty to themselves and the laws of their country, as to let their misguided zeal, and the evil counsels of others older and possessing more corrupt hearts than themselves, ever have led them into so perilous a situation; a situation which would have been far more perilous, if the burglarious part of the charge had been found against them; for in that case, as in the present, he should have felt himself constrained for the sake of example, in order to put an end to such disgraceful outrages, to have exerted the full authority of the law; nor did he know but he should have ordered it to have been carried into execution. As it now stands, the extent of his power was to order them to be transported for the term of <em>Fourteen Years</em>, to any part of his Majesty’s foreign settlements to which his Majesty’s Privy Council might direct; which sentence he accordingly pronounced. At the same time, he gave them to understand, if they behaved themselves, and <em>the tumults in the neighbourhood ceased</em>, they might expect the hands of mercy to be extended towards them in lessening their punishment.</p>
<p><em>Robert Poley</em>, aged 16, charged with frame-breaking at Sutton-in-Ashfield, on the 13th of November last, was next brought to the bar, and pleaded guilty; in consequnece of marks of contrition the Judge sentenced him to seven years transportation.</p>
<p>After which, Joseph Peck, aged 17, was put to the bar, and convicted of being concerned on the night of the 13th of November, 1811, in breaking upwards of 20 frames, in the house of Francis Bettis, and sentenced to <em>Fourteen years Transportation</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>With the penalties of the Frame Breaking case not yet avsailable to the court, it is interesting to note how clearly the Judge appears to have clarified the different sentences for frame breaking, a felony, and as such punishable by transportation, with the capital sentence of burglary.</p>

<p>Northampton Mercury - Saturday 28 March 1812</p>
<p>ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At Nottingham assizes, William Carnel, aged 22, and Joseph Maples, aged 16, for entering by force into the dwelling-house and shop of John Braithwaite, at Basford, on the 3d of January last, and therein breaking and destroying seven stocking frames, after a patient hearing, were found guilty. The Judge explained the law of the case, which applied equally to the cases of all the other prisoners, namely, that should the Jury be of opinion that the prisoners entered the house with violence for the purpose of frame-breaking only, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if they were of opinion they had entered the premises with other designs, and that they had done other damage, then the offence was capital. The Jury brought in a verdict, finding the prisoners guilty of frame-breaking, and they were both sentenced to 14 years’ transportation.—Two other prisoners, viz. Benjamin Hancock, aged 21, and Joseph Peck, aged 17, for riot and frame-breaking, at Sutton-in-Ashfield, received a similar sentence. Gervas Marshall, aged 17, George Poley, aged 16, and George Green (the latter a prisoner on bail), for frame-breaking, at Sutton aforesaid, were sentenced to seven years’ transportation each.—George Hinchliffe, for horse stealing, and William Wells, alias Black Tom (a notorious character,) for highway robbery, were found guilty, and received sentence of death; but the Judge was pleased to reprieve them before he left the town.</p>
</div>
<p>Sentenced to transportation, the Maples, and Carnell, along with several others under similar sentence, were tranported off to the hulks.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 04 April 1812</p>
<p>At an early hour on Monday morning last, the following persons, convicted of frame-breaking, at the late Assizes, were removed from the county gaol, under the care of Mr. Wright, assisted by Parkes, Atkin, and three other Officers front Bow Street, in order to be put on board the hulks at Woolwich, (viz.) Joseph Maples, William Carnell, Benjamin Hancock, and Joseph Peck, under sentence of transportation for fourteen years; and Gervas Marshall, Robert Poley, and George Green, under sentence of transportation for seven years each. They were escorted by a detachment of hussars to Leicester, front whence they were to be guarded by the Blues to the place of their destination.—A Petition on behalf of these unfortunate individuals was sent to the Prince Regent last week, praying for mitigation of punishment, which was signed by upwards of four thousand frame-work knitters.</p>
</div>
<p>The removal of the men was apparently not a simple affair, however. Fearing not just an anticipated mob protesting for the release of the men, but perhaps also a rescue attempt, it seems as if quite unusual measures were adopted to effect the safe transfer of the prisoners.</p>

Lancaster Gazette - Saturday 11 April 1812</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM RIOTERS.</p>
<p>The removal of the four Nottingham Rioters, sentenced to fourteen years transportation at the late assizes; and three for seven years, was very properly not left to tbe common mode, merely by the gaolers, but every due precaution was taken to guard against any disturbance, or to prevent any attempt at a rescue by their deluded associates. Accordingly, Pearkes and Adkins, the Bow street Officers, attended by several of the patrole, were dispatched to Nottingham to make arrangements for the safe and quiet removal of the convicts. They arrived at Nottingham on Saturday sennight, when they proceeded to make secret arrangements for removing the convicts as privately as possible. The Officers arranged with the General of the District for a party of cavalry to guard them for some distance oa the road. They agreed with a Stage-coach Proprietor for the whole of the coach, inside and out, and to J start at an hour it was not accustomed to do. On Monday morning, soon after five o’clock, the stage-coach and four drove up to the door of the prison; another pair of horses were stationed near at hand, they were put to without delay; at that instant the convicts had handcuffs slipped on them, having been pieviously chained, and they were hurried into and upon the coach, Pearkes and Adkins going one inside and the other outside. At the instant the convicts came out of the prison, a man was stationed to give the signal to the cavalry, who were at a short distance; they immediately mounted their horses, rode up, and surrounded them; the whole was managed so secretly and so instantanously, that there was not forty people collected. They proceeded on very quietly till they got to Leicester, where they stopped to breakfast, and the time occupied in that, and the novelty of a military guard escorting a stage-coach, attracted a very great crowd; however every thing was perfectly quiet. The military proceeded a few miles out of Leicester, and then all danger being considered at an end, the Officers dismissed them, and airived at Newgate with them on Tuesday; and on Thursday delivered them at the Hulks, at Woolwich.</p>

<p>At Derby Assizes, Perceval Cook, and James Tomlinson, alias Fruz, for burglariously breaking into, and robbing the dwelling-house of Mr. Samuel Hunt, of Ockbrook Mill, and also for a burglary committed at the dwelling-house of Mr. John Brentnall, of Locko Grange, were capitally convicted, and are left for execution. John England, convicted of being an accessary before the fact in the burglary at Locko Grange, and an accessary after the fact in the burglary at Ockbrook Mill; and John Thompson, for burglariously entering into, robbing the dwelling-house of Mr. Thos. Theobald, at Wilstrop, were each capitally convicted, and received sentence of death, but were afterwards reprived. (Thomas Draper, an accomplice in the burglaries committed at Ockbrook Mill and Locko Grange, was admitted evidence for the Crown.)</p>

<p>Whilst a demand was made in one of the houses that a contract be signed regarding the lowering of the price of corn, we might wonder whether this was just a veneer to try to gain some “Luddite credibility” for the attack.</p>

<p>Leeds Mercury - Saturday 11 April 1812</p>
<p>DERBY ASSIZES.— At these assizes last week, <em>James Tomlinson</em>, <em>Perceval Cook</em>, and <em>John England</em>, were found guilty of an outrage connected with the frame-breaking system—that of forcibly entering the house of Mr. Samuel Hunt, at Ockbrook Mill, on the 23d of December last, compelling him to sign a paper that he would lower the price of corn and flour, and robbing his house of a considerable sum in bank bills and other effects. -They were all sentenced to death, and repeatedly assured by the Judge that no hope of mercy remained to them.— <em>John Thompson</em> was found guilty of a similar offence, at the house of Thomas Theobald, at Wilsthorpe. The Judge, in passing sentence of death upon him, was peculiarly impressive, and very much affected. His Lordship said he understood that the prisoner’s father had ten or eleven children, and that his grandfather now lay dead in the house of a broken heart, on account of the prisoner’s abandoned conduct, and the fate that hung over him. The Judge gave him hopes of mercy, in consequence of some important discoveries he had made respecting the desperate gang with which he associated.</p>
</div>
<p>When the death sentence was passed, it was required to be carried out within a matter of days, and as much mileage as possible was often extracted to exhort others not to go down a similar path, or they too would meet an equally terrifying end.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 18 April 1812</p>
<p>Execution of Perceval Cook and James Tomlinson.— Perceval Cook, and James Tomlinson, alias Fruz, who were convicted of burglaries at Derby assizes, were executed about half-past twelve o’clock oa Friday se’nnight, pursuant their sentence, on a new drop erected in front of the county gaol, in the presence of a numerous concourse spectators.— From the time of their condemnation they conducted themselves with the utmost propriety, and were unremittiug in their supplication obtain Divine mercy. A short time previous to their execution they received the sacrament from the hands of the Rev. N. Bayley, chaplain to the prison, (who has been most assiduous in his application to these unfortunate men), in the presence of Thomas Draper, who was admitted evidence for the Crown, and William Tomlinson (the brother of James Tomlinson), now under sentence of transportation for uttering forged Bank of England notes.—This scene, and the separation of the two brothers was truly affecting, and may be better conceived than described. James Tomlinson preserved his firmness of mind to the last, and continued to exhort Draper and his fellow-prisoners for a considerable time in the most anxious and persuasive manner to refrain from their former course of life; and after spending a short time in prayer on the platform, they met their fate with becoming fortitude,-Their bodies after hanging the usual time were given to their friends, and taken away the same evening for interment.</p>
<p>Cooke was a native of Dale Abbey, and we understand of religious and industrious parents, who gave him a suitable education, and bound him apprentice to a framework knitter at Spondon; but his master dying before the expiration of his time, he went from Spondon to Nottingham, where he has left a wife and two children, the eldest about seven years of age. He was a deserter from the 43d regiment of foot, and declared he had not committed any material crime previous to October last.</p>
<p>James Tomlinson was born in the neighbourhood of Hinckley; was by trade a framework knitter, and is a deserter from several regiments. His parents are travelling hawkers, in the hardware line.</p>
