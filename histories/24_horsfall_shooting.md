ATROCIOUS MURDER. On Tuesday evening last, at about half past six o'clock, as Mr. WILLIAM HORSFALL a very extensive Woollen Manufacturer at Marsden, about seven miles from Huddersfield, was returning from the market at that place, he was assassinated on the public road, on Crossland Moor.

The circumstances, as stated to us by an eye-witness of this most barbarous Murder are these:— Mr. Horsfall and a Manufacturer, of the name of EASTWOOD, had left Huddersfield together, and at a short distant before they came to the fatal spot, Mr. Eastwood stopped to water his horse, while Mr. Horsfall rode leisurely along the road; when he had came within about 500 yards of the Warren Inn, a distance of about a mile and a half from Huddersfield, on the Manchester road, four men, each armed with a horse pistol, who had just before stepped out of a small plantation, placed the barrels of their pistols in appertures in the wall, apparently prepared for that purpose; the muzzel of two of these pieces Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw, but before he had time to extricate himself from his perilous situation, they all four fired, and inflicted four wounds in the left side of their victim, who instantly fell from his horse, and the blood flowed from the wounds in torrents. A number of passengers both horse and foot rushed almost instantly to the spot, and, after disentangling his foot from the stirrup, he was some difficulty got to the Inn.

The Murderers, after they had perpetrated the sanguinary deed, walked to the distance of some yards, and soon after briskening their speed, they ran towards Dungeon Wood, and entirely escaped undiscovered, no pursuit or search having been made after them, till the arrival of a troop of the Queen's Bays, about three quarters of an hour afterwards. One of the Assassins is described to us as about six feet high, another as a low portly man, and the two others as about five feet six or seven inches high, and rather slender; they all wore dark coarse woollen coats, and appeared to be working men.

From a professional Gentleman, who was called in to visit Mr. Horsfall, we learn, that three of the wounds, out of the four, were slight, and unattended with danger, but the fourth made by a musket ball, which entering the abdomen on the left side had taken a downward direction, and lodged in the back part of the right thigh, from which it was extracted on Wednesday, along with a pistol ball, at which time, some faint hopes were entertained of the patient's recovery; but on Thursday morning, about five o'clock, a profuse bleeding came on, accompanied by mortification, by which the thigh was swollen to an enormous size, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning, he expired, in perfect possession of his faculties.

Mr. Horsfall had a very large Woollen Manufactory at Marsden, wherein about 400 work people were employed; and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting, and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds, and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious in a high degree to the machine destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack on his property, committed a crime against his person, that will embitter every future day of their existence, and, that will, in all probability through the retributive justice of that Being, from whom no secrets are hid, bring the blood-stained perpetrators of this worst of crimes, to an ignominious end.

A reward of £2000 will, we understand, be offered immediately to any person who will give such information as will lead to the conviction of any one or more of the four men concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall.

Huddersfield, May 7, 1812  

MR EDITOR—I am sorry to inform you the Luddites have been very active in collecting arms this last week, and have been too successful. They proceeded to peoples' houses, in the townships of Almondbury, Wooldale, Farnley, Netherthong. Meltham, Honley, and Marsden, and many other places in this neighbourhood; they entered the houses by about 20 or 30 in a gang, and demanded all the arms in the house, on pain of instant death. By this means they have obtained possession of upwards of 100 stand of arms since my last letter to you, and not one night has passed without some arms having been so taken. In order to check this alarming evil, Major Gordon has obtained possession of 200 stand of arms from the inhabitants in this neighbourhood; the military are in this manner daily employed in collecting arms, but they have not yet been fortunate enough to discover the depot of the Luddites.

A person, who appears a very suspicious character, was apprehended in Saddleworth, last Tuesday. and committed to Towzer here, and who will undergo an examination before the magistrates here tomorrow.

The Coroner's Inquest sat on the body of Mr. Horsfall last Thursday, and returned a verdict of *Wilful Murder* against some person or persons unknown. He was interred at Huddersfield parish-church, in a very private manner, last Saturday morning— few people knew till the funeral was over. It is presumed the business will be carried on at Marsden as usual.

You was misinformed with respect to Major Gordon's stable set on fire; the stable belonged to Mr. Allen Edwards, King-street, who wishes this mistake to be rectified; Mr. Edwards is a special constable, and had rendered himself obnoxious to the incendiaries by the vigilant discharge of his duty.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 11 July 1812

We have considered it our duty to inquire, with more than ordinary diligence, into the reports of discoveries made, and excesses committed in this county, during the last ten days, some of which, in a very exaggerated form, have found their way into the London Papers, and the following is the result of our inquiries:

On the 20th ult. the Luddites, about twenty in number, entered the house of Mr. John Wood, a shopkeeper at Huddersfield, and carried away a pistol and a small cask of gunpowder. On Friday the 3d est. parties of the same description, entered the houses of Mr. Benjamin Dyson and Mr. Wm. Mellor, of Stainiland, near Halifax, and took from each a gun and a sword. The same night, another party, about ten in number, armed and disguised, several of them with their shirts over their coats, attacked the family of Mr. Megson, a carpenter, residing near the Porter's-Lodge, at Whitley-Hall; after securing the family in a back room, they proceeded to rifle the drawers, and took away four Guinea Notes and some provisions. They did not demand any fire-arms. A person of the name of Patrick Doring, alias Dr. Bell, of Scholes, near Holmfirth, was apprehended on Tuesday, and was the following day committed to York Castle on a charge of endeavoring to intimidate witnesses from appearing at York in evidence against the rioters at the ensuing Assizes. —A person of the name of Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a Corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local-Militia, has been apprehended, charged on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place.— This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes of which he is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to a mental infirmity under which he is said to labour when he has "put an enemy is his mouth to steal away his brains." The story in the London Papers about the apprehension of 50 men, &c. is an entire fabrication, though two Police officers have been in that neighbourhood in disguise for some time, and the Military, both horse and foot, are very active, and were on duty all Wednesday night.

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Tuesday 14 July 1812

[Previous story above syndicated with a different closing and reference to Barrowclough being taken to Manchester.]

A person of the name Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local Militia, has been apprehended, charged, on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place. This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes which is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to mental infirmity under which he is said to labour. On the arrival of Barrowclough at Manchester, where he was taken for examination, for the purpose of placing him at a distance from his connections, he informed the Magistrates that there were two depots of arms, accumulated the disturbers of the public peace, one of them in the neighbourhood of Holmfirth, and the other near Grange Moor. On this information, about 300 of the Scotch Greys were dispatched from Manchester, Wednesday, into the Riding, and all the force in Huddersfield, civil and military, was ordered to co operate with the Greys in the seizure of the concealed arms; but after spending the whole night in a fruitless search, they returned to their quarters without making any discovery whatever. Having stated these facts, it is scarcely necessary to add, that the rumoured apprehension of 50 conspirators and of important discoveries made the police officers, is a mere fabrication —Leeds Mercury.
