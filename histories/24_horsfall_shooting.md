# The Shooting of William Horsfall

In the aftermath of an unsuccessful Luddite attack on the mill of William Cartwright, at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton, during which at least two of the Luddites suffered mortal injuries, George Mellor came to the conclusion that the man, rather than the mill, should be the focus of their attention.

## Several Shootings

Just over a week later, shots were fired at Cartwright, albeit without injury to him or his horse, as he made his way home from Huddersfield.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 April 1812

On Saturday, a regimental Court martial was held at Huddersfield, on the private, who mis-conducted himself at the attack on Rawfolds mill, in refusing or neglecting to defend it in the manner he ought to have done, he was guilty of neglect of duty, and was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. On Tuesday morning, he was marched, escorted by a detachment of dragoons, to Rawfold the scene of action, where he was tied sip, and received about 25 lashes, the remainder of his punishment being remitted at the earnest and repeated intercession of Mr. Cartwright.

On Saturday last, an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfolds Mill, by two villains who fired at him from behind an hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. This diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman, took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile on this side of Huddersfield. We have no words which can sufficiently describe our abhorrence of this dark and wicked attempt to murder. Surely, even the deluded followers of Gen. Ludd, cannot approve of private deliberate murder; are his troops already degenerated into a band of assassins? But wickedness is progressive, it is a downward road, the first step prepares the mind for a second, that for a third, until deeds of blood become familiar. And the man who begun his career, probably with the intention only of destroying machinery which he supposed inimical to his interest, ends it by deliberate assassination, There is something in this crime so cowardly, so foreign to the feelings of Englishmen, and so much at variance with the courage and humanity of our national character, that we are convinced, that not one man would have been found to have entered into the association, if it had previously intimated to him, that he was to exchange the character of an Englishman, for that of a cruel and cowardly Italian desperado. We would exhort and conjure those who are yet innocent of the blood of their fellow-creatures, to abjure a confederation which leads to such dreadful consequences, which sinks them below the level of civilized men, and points to the destruction of Society itself. It is at present possible to retreat; when we have next to address them, it may be too late.

The Committee of the association of Merchants and Manufacturers at Huddersfield, hove voted their thanks to Mr. Cartwright, for his intrepid and gallant conduct in the defence of his Mill at Rawfolds, by which he has rendered the most essential service to his country. The Committee have also presented Fifty Guineas to the men, under the command of Mr. Cartwright, for having so bravely and steadily performed their duty in this trying occasion

But it wasn't just the mill-owners who were threatened with violence.

Leeds, April 27.—Colonel Campbell, the Inspecting Officer of the district, has been threatened with destruction, for the official discharge of the arduous duty imposed upon him by the present unhappy disturbances. On Saturday last an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfold Mills, by two villains, who fired at him front behind a hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same time from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. The diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile from Huddersfield. Last Friday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, at Mr. G.Whitehead, a constable at the Paddock, near Huddersfield, was retiring to rest, a musket or blunderbuss was discharged through his stair-case window, and two slugs, two pistol-balls, and a piece of bone, were lodged in the ceiling. Mr. Whitehead fortunately received no injury.

Ten days after the attack on Cartwright, there would be another, more serious, shooting, and this time the target would not be so fortunate.

In *Leeds Mercury*, [Saturday 02 May 1812](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000076/18120502/011/0003).

ATROCIOUS MURDER. On Tuesday evening last, at about half past six o'clock, as Mr. WILLIAM HORSFALL a very extensive Woollen Manufacturer at Marsden, about seven miles from Huddersfield, was returning from the market at that place, he was assassinated on the public road, on Crossland Moor.

The circumstances, as stated to us by an eye-witness of this most barbarous Murder are these:— Mr. Horsfall and a Manufacturer, of the name of EASTWOOD, had left Huddersfield together, and at a short distant before they came to the fatal spot, Mr. Eastwood stopped to water his horse, while Mr. Horsfall rode leisurely along the road; when he had came within about 500 yards of the Warren Inn, a distance of about a mile and a half from Huddersfield, on the Manchester road, four men, each armed with a horse pistol, who had just before stepped out of a small plantation, placed the barrels of their pistols in appertures in the wall, apparently prepared for that purpose; the muzzel of two of these pieces Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw, but before he had time to extricate himself from his perilous situation, they all four fired, and inflicted four wounds in the left side of their victim, who instantly fell from his horse, and the blood flowed from the wounds in torrents. A number of passengers both horse and foot rushed almost instantly to the spot, and, after disentangling his foot from the stirrup, he was some difficulty got to the Inn.

The Murderers, after they had perpetrated the sanguinary deed, walked to the distance of some yards, and soon after briskening their speed, they ran towards Dungeon Wood, and entirely escaped undiscovered, no pursuit or search having been made after them, till the arrival of a troop of the Queen's Bays, about three quarters of an hour afterwards. One of the Assassins is described to us as about six feet high, another as a low portly man, and the two others as about five feet six or seven inches high, and rather slender; they all wore dark coarse woollen coats, and appeared to be working men.

From a professional Gentleman, who was called in to visit Mr. Horsfall, we learn, that three of the wounds, out of the four, were slight, and unattended with danger, but the fourth made by a musket ball, which entering the abdomen on the left side had taken a downward direction, and lodged in the back part of the right thigh, from which it was extracted on Wednesday, along with a pistol ball, at which time, some faint hopes were entertained of the patient's recovery; but on Thursday morning, about five o'clock, a profuse bleeding came on, accompanied by mortification, by which the thigh was swollen to an enormous size, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning, he expired, in perfect possession of his faculties.

Mr. Horsfall had a very large Woollen Manufactory at Marsden, wherein about 400 work people were employed; and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting, and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds, and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious in a high degree to the machine destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack on his property, committed a crime against his person, that will embitter every future day of their existence, and, that will, in all probability through the retributive justice of that Being, from whom no secrets are hid, bring the blood-stained perpetrators of this worst of crimes, to an ignominious end.

A reward of £2000 will, we understand, be offered immediately to any person who will give such information as will lead to the conviction of any one or more of the four men concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall.

Moor, and four slugs entered his body, since which the said Mr. Horsfall has died of the wounds he received; and also a reward of 600 guineas for the apprehension of both or either of those two men, who on Monday evening the 27th of April last, shot Mr. William Trentham through the breast, with a horse pistol, at his own door in Nottingham.

Lewes, May 4th.

...

The sudden, departure of the North York Militia from our barracks, on Tuesday last, placed this town and neighbourhood, under considerable alarm for the safety of London, where it was reported very serious riots had broken out, and which report prevailed; until the arrival of our Stage Coach, whose passengers quieted the minds of the people, by assuring them, that all was tranquility in the Metropolis. The soldiers marched at an hour’s notice, soon after noon, under orders to meet the Brighton division (which left its station there in carriages provided for that purpose, the same day) at Croydon (40 miles) the next morning at eight o'clock; but as no waggons could be obtained here, at so short a notice, they proceeded on their route on foot, until carriages were procured for them on the road, which enabled them to reach Croydon at nine on Wednesday morning; when after a short halt, we have since learnt, the regiment moved on in the same way, for Nottingham. We are still totally at a loss to account for the *necessity* of this forced march and consequent alarm.

Mr. Brierly, on Monday, received another letter from his brother, at Oldham, in Lancashire, giving a, more particular account of the riots in that town and neighbourhood. It states, that nine of the insurgents have been killed; and 27 wounded. None of the soldiers have fallen, though it appears, in one instance, they received the first fire. The farmers, and other dealers, are escorted to and from market. Messrs. Burton and Sons have abandoned their extensive concern, and sought personal safety in retirement, at some distant place.

On Thursday, the 23d_ ult. as Mr. Isaac Reynor, of Southwell, in Yorkshire, was returning home from Milnsbridge, he was shot at, and the ball of the gun, that was levelled at him, passed through his hat.

On Tuesday last, Mr. William Horsfall, of Marsden, near Huddersfield, in Yorkshire, cloth-merchant, was shot at as he was returning from Huddersfield Market, and received four slugs in his body, which wounded him dreadfully, and soon after caused his death.

On Monday last, as Mr. William Trentham, was knocking at his own door, in St. Mary’s Church-yard, in the town of Nottingham, two men, whom he saw standing very near, stepped up to him, and one of them instantly, and without one word being uttered, shot him thro’ the breast with a large horse pistol.

For the discovery of the above atrocious offenders, large rewards are offered in Saturday night's Gazette, with the Prince Regent's free pardon, to any of the persons concerned, excepting those who actually discharged the said guns or fire-arms.

Hereford Journal - Wednesday 06 May 1812

Mr. Cartwright, who bravely defended his property in Yorkshire, has been fired at three distinct occasions; but without doing him the slightest injury.

Mr. Trentham, notwithstanding his alarming wound, is likely to recover. The *Luddites* have had the audacity to placard the streets of Nottingham in the night, offering reward for Mr. Wilson, the Mayor, dead or alive. He had committed no other offence than signing the offer of a reward of 600*l.* from the corporation of Nottingham, for the discovery of the assassin who shot Mr. Trentham. These infatuated men are said actually meet the streets of Nottingham, in small parties, in the day time, and triumphantly talk over their nightly depredations.

...

A letter from, Huddersfield, dated Thursday, says— A melancholy circumstance took place in this neighbourhood yesterday evening. As Mr. Horsfall, of this town, was returning to his house at Marsden, about seven miles off, he was shot by some villains, concealed in plantation by the turnpike-road side on Crosland Moor, about two miles from Huddersfield. Mr. H. cried out, 'I am shot— I am murdered!' and turned his horse round, as if intending to go to a public-house about 200 or 300 yards below the plantation; four men made their appearance on the wall, but Mr. H. immediately fell from his horse, and they then went into the wood, and were seen no more. It supposed that no less than four slugs were discharged at him, one of which only has yet been extracted. The shots took place near the groin, and the lower part of the abdomen. Mr H. was concerned in a mill where shear-frames are used for dressing cloth; and it is his undaunted resolution in resisting the daring-association of frame breakers, called *Luddites*, that has marked him out for the vengeance of those lawless ruffians."

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 02 May 1812

A most horrid attempt was made on Monday night last, to take away the life of Mr. W. Trentham, senr. hosier, of this town. Mr. Trentham had been spending a convivial hour with a few friends, at Mr. Timms's, and returned home about a quarter past ten o'clock. On reaching his own house, in St. Mary's church yard, he knocked for admittance, and while waiting for the door to be opened, two men, whom he had observed to be standing very near, stepped up to him, when one of them instantly, and without uttering a word, discharged a large horse pistol at him, the ball from which entered his right breast, and passing in an oblique direction, lodged near the shoulder. This sudden and unexpected attack occasioned, as might naturally be supposed, the utmost consternation in the family. Mr. Trentham was assisted into the house, and Mr. Wright, surgeon, sent for immediately, who examined the wound, and fortunately succeeded in extracting the ball.—The assassins, who are described by Mr. Trentham, as very small men, instantly fled in different directions. We understand that Mr. Trentham (though not entirely out of danger) is now in a very fair way of recovery.—The Magistrates with the most laudable zeal have used every possible exertion to trace out the perpetrators of this diabolical deed, and have offered a reward of six hundred guineas for their apprehension and conviction; but we have not heard that any certain clue has yet been discovered that will lead to a detection of the wretches.

In order to cover this dreadful attempt on Mr. Trentham's life, a report has been industriously and maliciously circulated, that he had abated the price of his work. We have it from authority to state, that the house has never deviated from the last printed list agreed to by the hosiers, and that therefore the report is entirely without foundation.

Around the country, round-ups of the news in the areas associated with the Luddite discontent, continued to appear.

:class: dropdown
https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000215/18120509/021/0003
Staffordshire Advertiser - Saturday 09 May 1812

*Owing to the alarming state of the Country, the provincial news is now looked to with great interest and anxiety. We have therefore made the following selections from the Chester, Sheffield, Manchester, and other papers.*

LOCAL MILITIA.— The present perturbed state of the country has induced Government, to call forth the aid of the local militia regiments, in those districts which have been the scene of unlawful outrages. A part of the Royal Chester local militia regiment, the whole of which by a previous advertisement were to assemble on the 16th inst. have received orders from the Lieutenancy to march immediately to Stockport, on permanent duty for fourteen days, and for such further term as their services may be required, conformable with their engagement with government, The uniformly steady conduct of the Chester local militia, inspires us with a conviction, that the grateful task will speedily devolve upon us, of recording their prompt exertions as soldiers, and their peaceable demeanor as citizens— characters which in them are happily blended. The city of Chester, honourably for its character, has escaped that widely spreading contagion of public commotions which has disgraced some parts of the surrounding country; and those of her citizens who have enrolled themselves as the defenders of the country against the approach of a foreign despot, will feel the importance of preserving domestic tranquillity.— *Chester Courant.*

Manchester, May 5th.—The combined exertions of the Magistrates and the Committee, who have sat daily at the Police Office since the 9th ult. aided by the military force, and the operation of the "Watch and Ward Act," and the loyal and spirited conduct of the very large proportion of the respectable part of the population of the town and neighbourhood, particularly the Gentlemen who have taken upon themselves the duties of an armed horse patrole, have kept us comparatively tranquil during the last week.— Tranquillity is still further assured to us, by the arrival of several troops of the Scotch Greys, who have been relieved in the out posts, by detachments from other regiments, and by the arrival on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, by forced marches, and by the help of waggons, carts, &c. of those two fine regiments, the Buckinghamshire and Berkshire Militia, and several pieces of artillery. These, with the addition of twenty men from each of the Manchester, the Trafford, and the Newton Local Militia regiments, afford a military force equal to the task of quelling riots of far more terrific aspect, than those which have disgraced this neighbourhood for some weeks past.

This additional force, however, has not relaxed the vigilance of the magistrates, the municipal officers, or the Committee above mentioned; for though it is not imagined, that many of the inhabitants of this town are engaged in the systematized opposition to the laws of their country, yet the spirit which is evidently still alive the neighbourhood, and indeed through all the manufacturing district of this and the adjacent counties, is but too evident, and is such as to keep every one upon the alert, who is not dead to every thing which rouzes the energies of man.

From breaking machinery, which the shortsighted thought was inimical to the interests of the poor, the next step in guilt was burning the property of their neighbours, whose industry and economy had been greater than their own. To defend that property became a crime in their eyes, and the *climax* of guilt was resorted to. It has been long the reproach of Italy, that private assassinations are common there. From this foul stigma, this achmé of human turpitude, England, till now, has been free—but now the horrid stain is made—the national character is disgraced. In the course of one short week three attempts to assassinate have been made on persons, who had been guilty of doing what the lowest wretch who exists upon the earth, has a right to do, defended their property. Fortunately, Mr. Cartwright, the gallant owner of Rowcroft Mill `[sic]`, escaped the murderous intention. The aim of the assassins of Mr Horsefall was more sure. On Tuesday last, when passing over Crossiand-Moor, on returning from Huddersfield to his house in Marsden, he was shot at by three or four men, who took aim at him as he passed, from behind a wall. Several slugs entered his body, and he fell from his horse, mortally wounded, for in spite of every possible assistance, he died on Thursday morning. The third instance, in all probability, will terminate day as fatally as the last, since the unfortunate gentleman who fell, is far advanced in years, On Monday evening last, about ten o'clock, as Mr. Trentham, of Nottingham, a respectable hosier, was returning home, he was followed by two men, one of whom, as he was knocking at his own door, presented a horse pistol and shot him through the breast, the ball having since been extracted near the shoulder. As yet, all these wretches ere undiscovered, but Justice will not be long ignorant of such inhuman violators of every law, human and divine.

For the last fortnight men and women, in considerable numbers, have made *peremptory demands* of relief at the houses of respectable persons in the country, who were *obliged, through fear*, to comply with the unlawful demands. In many instances a certain amount was stipulated for.—*Manchester Exchange Herald.*

[Saturday's Gazette offers his Majesty’s pardon and a reward of 2000l. for the conviction of the persons who shot Mr. W, Horsefall, of Marsden, near Huddersfield, on Tuesday, of which wounds he is since dead; also 600l. reward and a pardon for the person who fired at Mr. W. Trentham, of Nottingham, on Monday evening last, as he was knocking at his own door, and wounded him in the breast; 100l. for the persons who discharged a gun at Mr. J. Raynor, of Lenthwaite, West Riding, on the 23d of April, the ball of which went through his hat; and 100 guineas and a pardon for the discovery of the persons who discharged a gun at Mr. E, Whitehead, Deputy Constable at Huddersfield, as he was going to bed, on the 15th ult.]

A poor woman in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on her way to a justice of the peace to obtain a warrant against some persons who had ill-treated her, was this week assaulted by the populace in one of the villages, who stoned her so as to fracture her skull, and it was not without considerable difficulty that she was rescued with her life from the fury of the mob. An opinion it seems had gone abroad, that the object of this unfortunate woman’s errand to the justice, was to communicate some information against the Luddites.

The Bolton Rioters’ Committee, or rather the Delegates, had planned a secret meeting, at which some important matters were to be discussed.— The fact became known to the Officers of Police, and it was deemed prudent not to prevent its taking place. The consequence was, that at the time the whole assemblage, consisting of 25 men, were taken by surprise, together with all correspondence. A man has also been apprehended at Eccles, in attempting to seduce the Local Militia, by offering five guineas bounty, and fifteen shillings per week, to all that would be *twisted in* (the term for swearing.) Many of the delegates are going round the country on the same service.—*Liverpool Courier.*

On Tuesday, in the House of Commons, Lord Stanley moved that the Petitions from Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, &c. against the Orders in Council, be referred to the consideration of a Committee of the whole House.— The motion of Lord Stanley was agreed to without opposition. We congratulate the country that the voice of the people, which has been long raised against these ruinous edicts, has at length been heard by the House of Commons, and that Ministers have judged it inexpedient any longer to oppose an inquiry into the effects of this their favourite measure; and we trust that the mass of evidence which will be produced on this subject, will be such as to render it also inexpedirnt for them to oppose their being rescinded. There is, at least, ground for hope. The will of the people, when perseveringly expressed by the constitutional mode of petitioning, must sooner or later prevail over every opposition that can be opposed by the mistaken policy of any administration. This is the only method by which grievances can be redressed. Tumults and insubordination will but aggravate their pressure, and lengthen their duration.— *Sheffield Iris.*

It is said, that Special Commissions will be issued for trying the rioters, and others engaged in the late tumults in Cheshire and Lancashire.
```

Although unconnected with the Luddite troubles, another shooting, again with fatal consequence, would also shock the country — the assassination of the Prime Minister, Spencer Percival, in the palace of Westminster, on May 11th, 1812 — *but that is another story altogether...*

THE SEALED BAG.

TO THE PRINTER OF THE MERCURY.

Sir,—The public are indebted to you for a satisfactory refutation of a calumnious assertion made by Mr Wilberforce, one of our County Members, against the Press and the People of this country, at the time the Reports of the Secret Committee of the Houses of Parliament were under consideration; but, as far as I recollect, you have not made any observations on the Reports themselves; and I beg leave through the medium of a paper always open to truth and fair argument, to call the attention of the public to the Report published by the Secret Committee of the Lords, for the purpose of shewing how unfit such Reports are to be made the grounds of Legislative enactments: I shall first quote certain passages from the Report, numbering each paragraph, for the purpose of reference, and then offer such remarks as present themselves:

(1.) "Some time after," (the murder of Mr. Horsfall) siys the Report, "a young woman was attacked in the streets of *Leeds*, and nearly murdered, her skull being fractured!"

(2) "The buildings belonging to *Messrs. Dickinsons*, in Leeds; were forcibly entered, and the *whole* of the goods there, consisting principally of cloths, cut to pieces."

(3) "*Leversedge*, rear *Hockmondwike*, is in the neighbourhood of the moors dividing Lancashire and Yorkshire."

(4) "About the same time," (when, as the Report states, the life of Mr. Cartwright was twice attempted on his way from Huddersfield) "a shot was fired at a Special Constable on duty at *Leeds*; and a ball was fired, at night, into the house of Mr. Armitage, a Magistrate in the neighbourhood, and lodged in the cieling of his bed-room."

(5,) "Colonel Campbell also, who commanded the troops at Leeds, was shot at, in the night of May the 8th, upon returning to his own house, by two men, who discharged their pieces at him within a distance of 20 yards."

On the first of these assertions I have to state, (and I appeal to the civil and military authorities of the town, in confirmation of every observation I offer upon the subject) that no such event as is here stated, took place in either Leeds or its neighbourhood.

(2) A quantity of goods were cut in the warehouse Val of Messrs. Dickinson, Carr and Shann; but to assert, that all the goods were cut to pieces, is to exaggerate the mischief.

(3.) "*Hockmondwike*," says the Report, "is in the neighbourhood of the moors dividing Lancashire  and Yorkshire!"—A marvellous piece of topographical information this!—It is is as much in the neighbourhood of those moors, as Leeds is in the neighbourhood of Halifax.

(4.) Here is a mass of blunders. No shot has been fired at any Special ConstabLe in Leeds; nor is there any Magistrate of the name of Armitage in the neighbourhood; and I will take upon me to assert, without fear of contradiction, that no Magistrate whatever, either of that or any other name has bren shot at, in the the county of York, during the disturbances.

(5.) Some shots were fired at Colonel Campbell's house; but the Colonel was not shot at, either at the distance of 20 yards, ot at any other distance.

These facts will serve to shew upon what vague and erroneous information the Report of the Secret Committee rests; and the object of these corrections is to render future Committees more cautious how they legislate, with such information, on points involving the character and liberties of the country. It will avail little to urge that circumstances in some respects resembling those stated in the Report took place elsewhere. The character of the town ofLeeds is injured by such imputations, and an air of discredit is thrown upon the proceedings of Parliament by such inexcusable blunders. How far the history of transactions in other places, as stated in this Report, are to be depended upon, I shall not take upon me to decide, but taking Leeds as the criterion, I do not apprehend that the public confidence in that Report can be implicit.

```

Faced with a lack of witnesses willing to come forward incriminate any of the men responsible for the shootings, rewards, and even pardons, were offered.

[ATROCIOUS MURDER article from Leeds Mercury, prefaced with:]

We formerly mentioned, that Mr Horsfall, of Marsden, had been waylaid, on his return home from market, by a gang of villains, by whom he was fired at and severely wounded. We are sorry to learn, by the following account, extracted, from the Leeds Mercury of Saturday last, that Mr Horsfall has since died of his wounds.

...

Mr Cartwright, who so bravely defended his property in Yorkshire, has been fired at on three distinct occasions but without doing him the slightest injury.

Mr Trentham, notwithstanding his alarming wound, is likely to recover. The Luddites have had the audacity to placard the streets of Nottingham in the night, offering a reward for Mr Wilson, the mayor, dead or alive. He had committed no offence than signing the offer of a reward of L.600 from the Corporation of Nottingham, for the discovery of the assassin who shot Mr Trentham. — These infatuated men are said actually to meet in the streets of Nottingham, in small parties, in the daytime, and triumphantly talk over their nightly depredations.

The Gazette of last Saturday offers his Majesty's pardon, and a reward of L.2000, for the conviction of the persons who shot Mr W. Horsfall, of Marsden, near Huddersfield, on Tuesday se'ennight, of which wounds he is since dead.— Also L. 600 reward, and a pardon, for the person who fired at Mr W Trentham, of Nottingham, on the evening of Monday se'ennight, as he was knocking at his own door, and wounded him in the breast.— L.100 for the person who discharged a gun at Mr J. Rayner, of Lendthwaite, West Riding, on the 23d April, the ball of which went through his hat.— 100 guineas, and a pardon, for the discovery of the person who discharged a gun at Mr. E. Whitehead, deputy constable, at Huddersfield, as he was going to bed, on the 15th ult.— And L.200 for the conviction of the persons who, on the night of the 21st of March, fired upon the boat's crew of his Majesty's schooner Pioneer, after she had chased three smuggling galleys on shore between Walmer and Deal, and by which two of them escaped.

Accounts from Manchester state, that another mill has been burned near that town, and a woman, who offered to give evidence against the criminals, was shot, while the military were escorting her to the magistrate.

Letters from different parts concur in stating, that the great tumults have subsided, but that shocking outrages are committed by small parties of depredators and assassins.

The most urgent representations, we hear, have within these few days been made to Government, that a renewal of disturbances might be expected in the northern counties, unless a greater proportion of troops was immediately sent down and quartered in those districts. It is said to have been ascertained by the Magistracy, that a regular organization had commenced in several places, and even oaths of fidelity and secrecy been administered to these deluded people. During the last week, not fewer than seven regiments have proceeded towards Cheshire and Lancashire. The provincial papers are filled with accounts of the movements of the military.

A Special Commission will shortly be sent down to Chester and Lancaster to try the rioters (about 30) who have been committed to gaol in those counties.

The difficulty in obtaining incriminating testimony against the Luddites seems, in part at least, to have been put down to the oaths that were believed to being adminstered to anyone who might have

Unlawful Oaths.

*Mr. Ryder*, after having made several observations upon the consequences resulting from the guilt of taking false oaths, and the practices of assassination, which had been of late so frequent, moved for leave to bring in a bill for the more effectual prevention of the administering and taking unlawful oaths. 

he grounds upon which the motion was made were, that oaths of a most dreadful kind were taken by various individuals in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and the other disturbed counties of the kingdom, by which they bound themselves to p secret every circumstance relative to the proceedings which they had adopted.

*Mr. Horner*, *Mr. Whitbread*, and others, opposed it, upon the principle that the existing laws should be tried before recourse was had to those of more violent operation.— Leave was given to bring in the Bill, making the administering of oaths a capital offence.

Whilst there may have been fewer attacks on machinery following the change of strategy from mill attacks to personal attacks, and the consequent killing of William Horsfall, it seems that some people, if not actually Luddites themselves, were using the cover of Luddism at least to arm themselves further.

In *Leeds Mercury*, [Saturday 09 May 1812](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000076/18120509/008/0003).

Huddersfield, May 7, 1812  

MR EDITOR—I am sorry to inform you the Luddites have been very active in collecting arms this last week, and have been too successful. They proceeded to peoples' houses, in the townships of Almondbury, Wooldale, Farnley, Netherthong. Meltham, Honley, and Marsden, and many other places in this neighbourhood; they entered the houses by about 20 or 30 in a gang, and demanded all the arms in the house, on pain of instant death. By this means they have obtained possession of upwards of 100 stand of arms since my last letter to you, and not one night has passed without some arms having been so taken. In order to check this alarming evil, Major Gordon has obtained possession of 200 stand of arms from the inhabitants in this neighbourhood; the military are in this manner daily employed in collecting arms, but they have not yet been fortunate enough to discover the depot of the Luddites.

A person, who appears a very suspicious character, was apprehended in Saddleworth, last Tuesday. and committed to Towzer here, and who will undergo an examination before the magistrates here tomorrow.

The Coroner's Inquest sat on the body of Mr. Horsfall last Thursday, and returned a verdict of *Wilful Murder* against some person or persons unknown. He was interred at Huddersfield parish-church, in a very private manner, last Saturday morning— few people knew till the funeral was over. It is presumed the business will be carried on at Marsden as usual.

You was misinformed with respect to Major Gordon's stable set on fire; the stable belonged to Mr. Allen Edwards, King-street, who wishes this mistake to be rectified; Mr. Edwards is a special constable, and had rendered himself obnoxious to the incendiaries by the vigilant discharge of his duty.
```

Across the Pennines, in Lancashire, dissent was more evident in the form of popular gatherings and "riot". Meanwhile, committals were being made to York Castle of men
claimed to have been involved in the attack on Rawfold's mill. To the south, in Nottinghamshire, the attack on Mr. Trentham was also interpreted as representing a sea change in Luddite tactics there. And with witnesses hard to come by, an increasing number of significant rewards were being offered.

Lancaster Gazette - Saturday 09 May 1812

*Local Militia.*—The present perturbed state of the country has induced Government to call forth the aid of the Local Militia regiments in those districts which have been the scene of unlawful outrages.—Six companies of the Chester Local Militia regiment, and a part of the artillery, marched to Stockport on Wednesday.

At a meeting of the Deputy Lieutenants of this county on the 1st inst. it was resolved to order out immediately one-third of each regiment of Local Militia throughout the county:—In consequence of which, four companies of the Lonsdale regiment assembled in this town on Monday last; on which day also four companies of the Amounderness regiment assembled at Preston; and four companies of the Blackburn Hundred Lower Division regiment assembled at Blackburn. The remainder of the Lonsdale regiment are to assemble here on Monday next.

On Wednesday last, about 500 of the Berkshire Militia arrived at Preston, and were followed on Thursday by about 200 more. They are to remain there till further orders.

"This town, we have the peculiar satisfaction of observing, continues to enjoy a state of uninterrupted tranquillity , and there is no reason to apprehend any return of insubordination. We have had a very considerable influx of soldiers. The Buckinghamshire militia, 800 strong, with two field-pieces attached, commanded by Col. Young, marched from Mansfield on Wednesday, and arrived here on Thursday evening. On Friday, the Berkshire, (Col. Vansittart) consisting of upwards of 600, reached here from Nottingham, under the command of Lieutenant-Col. Ravenshaw. The greatest part of the Manchester and Salford Local Militia, commanded by Col. Silvester, and the Newton and Failsworth, by Lieut Col. Keymer, have been called out, and it is gratifying to state that they assembled with commendable alacrity. 132 persons have already been sworn in under the Watch and Ward Act, for Salford, and upwards of 2000 for Manchester and the several other townships."- *Manchester Mercury*, May 5.

We are deeply concerned in stating, that in the neighbourhood of Bolton, Chowbent, Leigh, and Tyldesley, a secret system of organized riot, approaching to rebellion, has been carried on for some time. Many factories and mills were to be destroyed, and the lives of many respectable persons were threatened — By a well-conceived project, however, most judiciously executed, these secret meetings have been laid open, the private signals of the conspirators obtained, and by a patient and persevering duty of detachments of the Bolton Local Militia, their diabolical nocturnal assemblies are routed, their papers seized, and a great number of their ringleaders, (together with a person they call General Ludd, the grand administrator of impious rebellious oaths) have been secured, and sent to our Castle—Amongst the papers seized, is a roll containing a list of names of great numbers implicated, all of whom await the punishment of their country. The Magistrates are indefatigable —Much praise is due to Capt. Buller, of the Greys, and to his troop; and to Major Pilkington, and to his troop, whose services have been eminent; and we feel particular pleasure in mentioning the steady, loyal, and soldier-like conduct of the Bolton regiment of Local Militia, who, upon every occasion, act like veterans.

We cannot but deprecate the mode of exaggerating the proceedings of the rioters in different parts, and spreading unfounded reports of their numbers, &c.—The Chester Courant of Tuesday last contains the following paragraph:— "We understand there are upwards ol 100 persons now confined in Lancaster Castle, charged with rioting." We can assure the public, that in addition to the twenty-nine persons mentioned in our last, as being committed for that and other offences, four more only arrived, under an escort, on Sunday last, charged with setting fire to the factory at West Houghton, near Bolton.

...

*Rioters committed and sent off to Lancaster by the magistrates of Manchester.*— John Howard, Nathaniel Hilton, Richard Sothern, John Atkinson, John Lee, Thomas Hoyle, Henry Ashton, Phoebe Smith, Hannah Smith, John Oakes, Samuel Crossley, and Thomas Brookes; the three last from Worsley.

John Bird has been committed, but not yet sent off.

Jos. Thompson has been committed to Chester, charged with being concerned in the tumults at Mr. Goodair's house, at Stockport.

*Committed to York Castle* —James Haigh, of Dalton, in the West Riding, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Joseph Ardon, and other persons, as strongly suspected of having been one of the persons who, in the night of the 11th of April, riotously assembled and attacked the mill of Mr. W Cartwright, at Rawfolds— This man was apprehended at Methley, on Saturday week. It appears that since the attack above-mentioned, he had been at the house of a sister-in-law, at Pennistone, from whence he went to another sister at Methley. He was taken before John Radcliffe, Esq. of Milnsbridge, and after undergoing several examinations was fully committed on Thursday. He was conveyed to the Castle in a chaise and four, escorted by a party of dragoons. Two other men were apprehended as accomplices, at Hill-house, near Huddersfield, on Monday evening; after several examinations, one of them, named Stocks, was liberated, but the other, Cockroft, was remanded—On Monday night, it is strongly suspected, with a view to the rescue of the above men, the stable of Major Gordon, at Huddersfield, was set on fire, and nearly destroyed. The stratagem, however, failed; for instead of drawing away the guard which was placed over the prisoners, the officer, with great promptitude, doubled its force. Happily the fire did not communicate to any other building.

One of the most cold-blooded and atrocious murders ever known, was perpetrated in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on Tuesday evening, the 28th ult.—About half-past six o'clock, as Mr. Wm. Horsfall, of Marsden, a most respectable woollen-manufacturer, and Adjutant to the Upper Agbrigg Regt. of Local Militia, was returning from Huddersfield market, on horseback, he was fired at by four assassins, who had hid themselves in a small plantation adjoining the road on Crosland Moor, planting the muzzles of their guns through holes in the wall. Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw two of them, but too late to guard off their effect.Mr H left Huddersfield with a manufacturer of the name of Eastwood, and they proceeded together almost to the fatal spot, when the latter stopped to give his horse some water, Mr. H. going leisurely forwards—At this time the villains fired and lodged the contents of their four pieces in the left side of the unfortunate gentleman: he instantly fell, and was dragged a short distance in the stirrup, bleeding very much. Several passengers, both on horseback and foot, soon came to the spot, and after disentangling him from the stirrup, conveyed him to the Warren Inn, which is hard by.

In the confusion and alarm consequent on such a lamentable occasion, no one had presence of mind to pursue the murderers: they escaped into Dungeon Wood, undiscovered. Nor was any pursuit or search made after them till the arrival ot a party of the Bays from Huddersfield. Mr. Horsfall, at first, seemed much exhausted by the great loss of blood. — The best medical aid was obtained, and three shots out of the four were pronounced slight; but the fourth, from a musket-ball, had inflicted a mortal wound. On Wednesday some faint hopes of recovery were entertained, but in the course of the night, a fresh bleeding took place, the thigh became considerably swollen and had the appearance of mortification, and on Thursday morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock, death ensued. During the agonies of such a state, there was some consolation that this public-spirited and humane man retained the perfect possession ot his faculties.

This is one of the most lamentable events that has ever been recorded in our columns. The perpetration of it has evinced a spirit, with which we had hoped no Englishman could have been actuated.— Mr. Horsfall had a most extensive manufactory at Marsden, and employed near 400 work-people; for the last seven years he had worked shearing-frames in a part of the premises and had brought them to great perfection. — He had been most active too, in endeavouring to bring to justice the nocturnal assailants at Rawfolds. — His property was too well defended for them to risk an attack; and therefore the villains sacrificed a valuable life by means well worthy of an Italian Bravo, but which must embitter the remainder of their days with sufferings ten thousand times more acute than they were able to inflict, even if they should escape that ignominious end which the injured laws of their country demand.

The Luddites at Nottingham, we hear, have relinquished their system of frame-breaking to commit acts of much greater atrocity:— Letters from thence communicate an outrage perpetrated by these men hardly to be equalled for wantonness and cruelty. On Monday night the 27th ult about 11 o'clock, Mr. Trentham, of the house of Trentham, Tierney, and Morton, in the weaving trade, was waylaid on his return home by two ruffians, and just as he was about to step up to his door, one of them placed himself before him, and presenting a pistol, shot him through the left breast, and then made his escape. The report of fire-arms having brought the neighbours to the spot, surgical assistance was immediately procured, and the ball was extracted from the back, a little below the left shoulder. Mr. Trentham, (though not entirely out of danger) is in a fair way of recovery; he is 63 years of age.

On Saturday sennight, an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfold's Mill, by two villains, who fired at him from behind an hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. This diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman, took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile from Huddersfield.

Mr. Cartwright has received the thanks of the Committee of the Association of Merchants and Manufacturers, at Huddersfield, for his intrepid conduct in the defence of his mill. The said Committee have also presented the men who assisted in the defence, with fifty guineas.

Government, we understand, mean to send down a Special Commission, to Chester and Lancaster, to try the rioters who have been committed to gaol in those counties.—*Globe*.

In the House of Commons, em Tuesday last, Mr. Perceval said, that a Special Commission was, as soon as possible, to be sent to investigate the late atrocities in the country.

The Gazette of Saturday contains an advertisement from the Secretary of State for the Home Department, offering his Majesty's free pardon to any person except the individual or individuals that actually fired, who shall discover the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, and a reward of TWO THOUSAND POUNDS to be paid by Mr. Peace, of Huddersfield. And the like pardon, and a reward of £100 for the discovery of the person who fired at Mr. Isaac Raynor, of Linthwaite, as he was returning from Milnsbridge, on the 23d ult. the latter reward to be paid by Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. — Also, pardon and 100 guineas, for the discovery of the person who fired at George Whitehead, one of the constables of Huddersfield, as he was going to bed on the 15th ult. to be paid by Mr. Peace. — There is likewise a reward of 100 guineas offered for the apprehension of the villains who shot Mr. Wm. Trentham, of Nottingham, and a further reward of 500 guineas to any person who shall convict his accomplice. The same pardon is offered, except as before excepted.

The Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland has communicated to the High Sheriff, the approbation of his Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department, of the zeal and alacrity manifested by the Penrith and Whitehaven Local Militia, in their march to Carlisle.

```

Despite the magistrates' best efforts, little progress was made over the following weeks in trying to identify those responsible for the murder of William Horsfall.

Until, that is, a news report appeared that seemed to suggest that spies had identified where a cache of arms had been concealed, that *fifty* people had been arrested for involvement in the Luddite cause, and that one of Horsfall's assassins had been caught.

A Sheffield Paper of Saturday says—"At a late hour last night we received highly important and very gratifying intelligence to every friend of peace and good order. It states that two Bow-street Officers have been in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield for nearly three weeks past, and that they had been *twisted in*, or in other words had taken the oath of the Luddites. By this means, they have learned the proceedings and ways of these infatuated persons, and have obtained the knowledge of the depot where arms were concealed. Warrants were yesterday (Friday) issued for the apprehension of fifty of the ringleaders, and in the course of the day a great number of them were taken into custody. The actual murderer of Mr. Horsfall was discovered in a house about eight miles from Huddersfield, and is committed to Lancaster Castle to be tried for the said barbarous deed. He was seized yesterday morning about two o'clock within the county of Lancaster. The Queen's Bays were on duty during the whole of Thursday night and yesterday morning; and the Scotch Greys have arrived from Manchester to assist in this business. From the whole of this information we are led to believe, that the Secret Committees appointed by Parliament have recommended the executive Government to immediately issue authority for the Magistrates in this Riding, and in the county of Lancaster, to seize the papers, arms, &c. and to apprehend the principals and abettors of those outrages which have so lone disturbed so great a share of the country's peace."

We have considered it our duty to inquire, with more than ordinary diligence, into the reports of discoveries made, and excesses committed in this county, during the last ten days, some of which, in a very exaggerated form, have found their way into the London Papers, and the following is the result of our inquiries:

On the 20th ult. the Luddites, about twenty in number, entered the house of Mr. John Wood, a shopkeeper at Huddersfield, and carried away a pistol and a small cask of gunpowder. On Friday the 3d est. parties of the same description, entered the houses of Mr. Benjamin Dyson and Mr. Wm. Mellor, of Stainland, near Halifax, and took from each a gun and a sword. The same night, another party, about ten in number, armed and disguised, several of them with their shirts over their coats, attacked the family of Mr. Megson, a carpenter, residing near the Porter's-Lodge, at Whitley-Hall; after securing the family in a back room, they proceeded to rifle the drawers, and took away four Guinea Notes and some provisions. They did not demand any fire-arms. A person of the name of Patrick Doring, alias Dr. Bell, of Scholes, near Holmfirth, was apprehended on Tuesday, and was the following day committed to York Castle on a charge of endeavoring to intimidate witnesses from appearing at York in evidence against the rioters at the ensuing Assizes. —A person of the name of Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a Corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local-Militia, has been apprehended, charged on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place.— This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes of which he is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to a mental infirmity under which he is said to labour when he has "put an enemy is his mouth to steal away his brains." The story in the London Papers about the apprehension of 50 men, &c. is an entire fabrication, though two Police officers have been in that neighbourhood in disguise for some time, and the Military, both horse and foot, are very active, and were on duty all Wednesday night.

A person of the name Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local Militia, has been apprehended, charged, on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place. This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes which is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to mental infirmity under which he is said to labour. On the arrival of Barrowclough at Manchester, where he was taken for examination, for the purpose of placing him at a distance from his connections, he informed the Magistrates that there were two depots of arms, accumulated the disturbers of the public peace, one of them in the neighbourhood of Holmfirth, and the other near Grange Moor. On this information, about 300 of the Scotch Greys were dispatched from Manchester, Wednesday, into the Riding, and all the force in Huddersfield, civil and military, was ordered to co operate with the Greys in the seizure of the concealed arms; but after spending the whole night in a fruitless search, they returned to their quarters without making any discovery whatever. Having stated these facts, it is scarcely necessary to add, that the rumoured apprehension of 50 conspirators and of important discoveries made the police officers, is a mere fabrication —Leeds Mercury.

Leeds, September 7. We feel sincere pleasure in being enabled to state, that for several days past, the Magistrates of Manchester, have been humanely exerting themselves towards those unfortunate and deluded men called Luddites, numbers of whom have applied voluntarily to take the oath of Allegiance, and to be absolved from the injunction of that dreadful bond which, under the late system of terror and riot, they had become parties to. That the great mass of those who were *twisted in* did not comprehend the nature ot the connexion they were admitted into, is well ascertained; they have expressed it; and that they were the innocent dupes of more designing men. But if a doubt remained of the existence of a plot of a dangerous tendency, it is now removed by a knowledge of the fact. The Magistrates of that district are daily applied to at their own houses, to fulfil the benevolent intention of Government, in receiving back to sober reason and morals, the deluded and mistaken objects of nocturnal association; and are always employed in their pubic capacity, at the New Bayley Court-House, on appointed days in the same charitable object.

THE MURDERERS OF MR. HORSFALL.  
We copy the following curious article from the Courier of Thursday the 29 ult.:-  
To the Editor of the Courier. Huddersfield, Oct. 24.

Sir.- A very important event happened here on Thursday last, of which as the Leeds Mercury of today does not appear to have had any information, I hasten to communicate the intelligence through the medium of your paper.

A man has been taken up and examined before that indefatigable Magistrate Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. and has at length received the offer of his Majesty's pardon, and given the most complete and satisfactory evidence of the horrible murder of Mr. W. Horsfall. In consequence of this, the whole of the wretches concerned in that dreadful transaction, have been taken and committed to York Castle, to take their trial at the ensuing Commission of Assize. — He was with the party (four in number) when Mr. Horsfall was shot.

They were furnished with loaded pistols by ——— who ordered them to take their stand in the Plantation on Crossland Moor. Two others soon after joined them, and took their station about twenty yards before then. When the unfortunate Gentleman came up, two fired. They then all fled across the fields, and ——— damned them all the way for not firing their pieces. Two ran forwards to Honley, four miles off, and two more stopped at a place called Dungeon Wood, and hid their pistols at ————'s house there, in some flocks— left their great coats, and ran immediately in their jackets to Huddersfield, where the news of the murder had but just arrived. The next morning they all four met at the work-shop of their employer (a cropper) and ———— produced a Bible. and made them all swear not to betray each other.

These villains have frequently been examined before, but have always been discharged for want of sufficient evidence. One behaved with the greatest effrontery till he saw ———, and then he changed colour and gasped for breath. When he came out, he said "Dam that ————, he has done me."

It appears ——— and ———— have been Chiefs in all the disgraceful transactions that have occurred in this part of the country the last twelve months, especially at Rawfolds, where the former was captain of the gun-division, and the latter of the pistol. ————— has thus made discoveries which will lead to the detection of a great number of these offenders, and, it is hoped, ultimately restore the West-Riding to its former tranquility.

EXECUTION.

The execution of these unhappy men took place on Friday se'nnight, at nine o'clock, at the usual place behind the Castle, at York. Every precaution had been taken render every idea of a rescue impracticable. Two troops of cavalry were drawn up at the front of the drop, and the avenues to the castle were guarded by infantry. Five minutes before nine o'clock, the prisoners came upon the fatal platform. After the ordinary had read the accustomed forms of prayer these occasions, George Mellor prayed for about ten minutes; he spoke with great apparent fervency and devotion, confessing in general, the greatness of his sins, but without any allusion the crime for which he suffered. He prayed earnestly for mercy, and with pathos that was affecting. The surrounding multitude were evidently affected.—William Thorpe also prayed, but his voice was not so well heard. Smith said little, but seemed to join in the devotion with great seriousness. The prisoners were then moved to the front the platform, and Mellor said, "Some of enemies may be here, if there be, I freely forgive them, and all the world, and hope the world will forgive me." William Thorpe said, "I hope none of those who are now before me, will ever come this place." They were executed in their irons. They appeared slightly convulsed for few moments.

The number people assembled in York, was much greater than is usual on these melancholy occasions, but not the slightest indication of tumult prevailed, mid the greatest silence reigned during the whole of this solemn and painfully lamentable scene.

YORK SPECIAL COMMISSION OF ASSIZE.

*Before Baron Thompson and Mr. Justice Le Blanc.*

After the Grand Jury were sworn, Baron Thompson in his charge, observed, "that they were assembled at a season of the year unusual for the solemnities of justice.—The various acts of outrage that have been perpetrated on the lives and property of individuals, require the necessity of investigating the circumstances which have lately disturbed the public peace. —The commencement of these destructive proceedings originated in a neighbouring county, *(we suppose the learned Judge allude to Nottinghamshire,)* and had at first for their object the destruction of machinery, which, by diminishing the quantity of human labour in our manufactures, was supposed by them to be inimical to the interests of the labouring classes; a notion probably infused into their minds by some evil-disposed persons, for the worst of purposes.— But more fallacious and ill-founded argument cannot be conceived.—It is to machinery that we probably owe the existence, certainly the excellence and extent of our manufactures.—Whatever lessens the expence of preparing an article by diminishing its price, promotes its and increases the demand for it; and if the use of machinery was discontinued, our manufactures would be destroyed.—The spirit of insubordination quickly spread, and reached the West Riding of this county, and from the destruction of machinery used in manufactures, the transition was easy to the destruction of buildings: the destruction of buildings led the stealing of fire-arms, to carry on their daring designs, and from the stealing of arms to indiscriminate plunder of every kind of property, and even to murder itself. Innocent and useful men have suffered their persons and property from this violence and these depredations, and some of them under circumstances which carried with them the utmost terror and alarm.—But the worst feature is yet behind, that of a most daring assassination, the murder of Mr. Horsfall in open day, as he was returning from Huddersfield. —He was fired at from behind a wall, a few miles from Huddersfield, by several persons, and severely wounded; of which wounds he died within a day or two.—With this murder several of the persons in the calendar stand charged.—In this case, as well as some others, it may necessary to submit to your consideration the testimony of an accomplice; you will attentively consider in what respects his evidence is corroborated and rendered worthy of credit, by other circumstances.

"Several changes, (said his Lordship,) will probably be brought before you, and preferred for burglaries and robberies force and violence, day and by night, as well as for maliciously shooting, which has been rendered a capital offence in the present reign: on these cases I do not know that it is necessary to make any observations; you will dispose of them according to the evidence. —There is another species of offence deserving of your most serious attention, that of administering unlawful oaths. No person who seriously reflects on the infinite mischief which may result to society, from men combining in associations under the sanction of an oath, can consider these punishments in the least degree too severe. I feel a perfect confidence that the country may safely rely upon your vigilance and attention, and that no indignation excited by the consideration of atrocities which have been committed, will excite in your minds any prejudice, when you are weighing the evidence [of] any individual, whose case may come under your consideration, and which you will determine solely by the evidence laid before you. I cannot conclude without recommending to you, that your earnest endeavours may be constantly exerted to induce a spirit of subordination and obedience to the laws, and to confirm all within the sphere of your influence, in their allegiance to His Majesty's throne; which is the only effectual means of preserving the peace, prosperity, and happiness of the country."

*John Swallow*, *John  Batley*, *Joseph Fisher*, and *John Lamb* were on Tuesday tried on a charge of burglary, in obtaining entrance by threats of violence into the dwelling-house of Samuel Moxon, of Brightfield, and stealing therefrom several promissory notes and some other articles. The facts were clearly made out against them, and the jury found them guilty, but recommended John Lamb to mercy, on the ground that he was not armed or disguised, and that he appeared to act under the influence of Swallow.

*George Mellor*, of Longroyd Bridge, cloth-dresser, aged 22; *William Thorpe*, of Huddersfield, 23; and *Thomas Smith*, of Huddersfield, 22, were indicted for the wilful murder of Mr. William Horsfall, merchant and manufacturer, at Marsden, in the West Riding of the County of York, on Tuesday, the 28th day of April, 1812.

Mr. PARKE, in his address to the Jury, took notice of the reasons which induced these deluded criminals to mark Mr. Horsfall as an object of their vengeance. He was a manufacturer to a considerable extent in Woollen Cloths, at Marsden, wherein about 400 work-people were employed, and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious to the Machine-destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack upon his property, committed a crime upon his person. Nothing could be more ill founded than the idea, that the introduction of machinery into our manufactories, lessens the quantity of human labour, and abridges the means of subsistence. The very reverse of this is the truth. It greatly increases and enlarges both. Mr. Horsfall, the deceased, was a man of warm feelings, and who seeing the fallacy and absurdity of the prejudices against machinery, hud declared his intention of resisting the attempts of the daring violators of the law, and of supporting the machinery attempted to be put down by violence; in consequence of this, it was determined that he should taken off.

Mr. Parke proceeded to review the evidence which would be brought forwards to substantiate the crime upon the prisoners, "that although the accomplice, Benjamin Walker, was a very wicked man, and equally guilty with the rest of the prisoners, I shall not ask you to convict the prisoners on his testimony only, I shall confirm it by a chain of strong and well connected circumstances, all tending to establish the guilt of the prisoners. But it is not necessary that an accomplice should be confirmed in every circumstance; had that been the case, his evidence would be unnecessary, and we should have not taken him from that bar and placed him in the witness box, but have left him to the fate his crimes deserved. This accomplice will state to you, that in the shop in which he worked at Longroyd Bridge, a short distance from Huddersfield, conversations of the most inflammatory kind passed with respect to the transactions at Nottingham, which these men were unfortunately in the habit of *reading in the NEWSPAPERS*, and of the attack upon Mr. Cartwright's mill, in which some persons were killed and wounded, on which occasion, George Mellor, the first of the prisoners named in the indictment, said that he was determined to have Mr Horsfall taken off. But the accomplice knew nothing of the time until the very same afternoon when this threat was carried into execution: the proposal took him by surprise; he consented to accompany them, and had a pistol given to him by Mellor, who himself had large horse pistol loaded almost to the top. This pistol he had borrowed; that he put into it a treble charge of powder, that he then put in a ball as large as a musket ball, two slugs and another ball, all of which he rammed down into the pistol; the person who observed this extraordinary conduct, said "you not mean to fire that pistol I hope!" He replied, "Yes, I mean to do for Horsfall; will you go with us?" Thorp, the second prisoner, was also seen to load a pistol at Wood's shop, the place where all the prisoners worked. It will, no doubt, strike you as singular, that declarations of this kind should be made in so open a manner; but it proves the dreadful state in which this part of the country was in, when a murder could be talked of with so little caution and disguise. The accomplice rather objected to go, but afterwards consented to be of the party, and he and Smith went to the fatal spot together. As they were going, Walker, the accomplice, again expressed a wish not to go, and proposed to Smith to return. Smith said "nay, let us go forward and endeavour to persuade Mellor and Thorpe not to do it; but if we turn back we shall be shot." In a short time, the word was given that Horsfall was coming, and Mellor and Thorp fired—and immediately ran past Smith and Walker, and said they were flats. They then all of them run through plantation across some fields to Dungeon Wood They here separated, and Smith and Walker went to Honley. Mr. Parke proceeded to state various declarations made by Mellor and Thorp distinctly admitting that they had perpetrated the deed; and the following day an oath was administered by Mellor and Thorp to the work people, at the shop, to keep the murder a secret.

From the evidence of John Armitage, who lives at Crossland Moor, and keeps a public-house, called the Warren House, that Mr. Horsfall had, on the 28th of April, been at Huddersfield market, and on his return called at witness's house about a quarter past six in the evening; stopped at the door, got a glass of rum and water, treated two persons who were there, paid his reckoning, and rode away—did not stop twenty minutes at witness's, nor did he get off his horse.— Between witness's house and Marsden, there is a plantation belonging Mr. Radcliffe, and about quarter of a mile from Warren house. About a quarter past six o'clock, witness heard some children say that Mr. Horsfall had been shot. Witness and the two persons whom the deceased had been treating went out together and found Mr Horsfall about twenty or thirty yards below the plantation, sitting on the road side, bleeding very much. They got him down to Warren-house as soon as they could. Mr. Horsfall died there.

Henry Parr was at Huddersfield on the 28th of April last; was upon the road between Huddersfield and Marsden, and after he had passed the Warren-house, heard the report of fire-arms; saw a person riding before him; report seemed come from Mr Radcliff's plantation; saw smoke rising at the same time, and four persons were in the plantation in dark coloured clothes; the person who was before witness on horseback, after the report fell down on the horse's chine, and the horse turned round as quick as possible; the person, who it appears was Mr. Horsfall, raised himself by the horse's main, and called out murder. As soon he called out murder, one of the four men got on the wall with one hand and two feet, and Parr called out "have you got enough yet," and he (Parr) set off to Mr. Horsfall at full gallop. Mr. H. said, "good man, you are a stranger to me, I'm shot," and was then going to fall off his horse. Mr. Horsfall grew sick; witness took hold of his arm; blood began to flow from his side. Mr. H. desired witness to go to Mrs. Horsfall's.

Bannister, a clothier, met Parr on the road galloping, who told witness that Mr. Horsfall was shot. Witness found Mr. H. on the road side very bloody.

Mr. Horton, surgeon, gave his testimony personally—he extracted a hall from the deceased, and found several wound's in the deceased's body, and had no doubt they were the cause of Mr. Horsfall's death.

Benjamin Walker, accomplice, stated that the prisoners, George Mellor and Thomas Smith, worked with him at Wood's; and in a conversation about the attack on Mr. Cartwright's mill, Mellor said there was no way to break the shear's—but shoot the master. Mellor, the day Mr. Horsfall was shot, brought a loaded pistol, and gave it to witness, and said he must go with him to shoot Mr Horsfall. The pistol was double-loaded. Witness and the three prisoners went to the plantation. Smith had a pistol which he shewed to the witness. Smith and Walker went together, and got to the plantation first—Thorpe and Mellor came afterwards. Mellor ordered witness and Smith to fire, if they (Mellor and Thorpe), missed Horsfall; witness did not fire, but heard Mellor say Mr. Horsfall was coming, and soon after heard the report of a pistol; witness was about twenty yards off; they waited at this distance till the job was done. Witness and several others who were examined upon the trial, proved, that the murder was well known amongst those *twisted in*, and an oath was taken not reveal it.

The defence of the prisoners was an alibi, but it completely failed: there facts were fully made out in evidence, and the jury after retiring about half an hour, found all the prisoners guilty.

Mr. Justice le Blanc immediately passed sentence of Death upon them, ordering them to be executed on Friday, and their bodies given to the surgeons.

The trial of the murderers lasted from nine o'clock in the morning till nine at night.

On Thursday, John Scholefield was charged with maliciously firing a loaded gun at John Hinchliffe,—was acquitted.

Hinchliffe swore positively to the fact of Scholefield shooting him, and gave a full, clear and connected narrative of the whole business; but it was given in evidence for the prisoner, that Hinchliffe had said, the day after his eye was shot out, he did not know either of the persons who had attacked him. It was also sworn, that Scholefield was in bed at the time of the attack. The prisoner was consequently acquitted. The trial lasted the whole of the day. Our readers will recollect that this prisoner was taken on board a vessel, in the Thames, about to sail for America.

On Thursday night, the grand jury came into court, and stated that they had no bill before them; on which occasion Mr. Parke said, "My learned friends and myself have examined the different cases which have not been presented to you, and, considering that many of these people have acted under the influence of other persons, we have, in the exercise of that discretion confided to us by the crown, declined at present to defer any other bills; and I hope this lenity will produce its proper effect, and that the persons on whom it is exercised will prove themselves, by their future good conduct, deserving of it; but if it is abused, proceedings against them can be resumed."

John Eadon, for administering to divers persons an unlawful oath.— *Guilty.*

John Baines the elder, butcher,—John Baines the younger,—Wm. Blakebrough,—Geo. Duckworth,—Charles Milnes, and Zachary Baines, all of Halifax, cordwainers, charged with administering, or aiding and assisting the said John Baines the elder, to administer an unlawful oath to John McDonald. —*All Guilty, except Zachary Baines, who was acquitted.*

The trial of the following eight persons concerned in the attack of Mr. Cartwright's Mill, came on about nine on Saturday morning, and lasted till a quarter past seven in the evening.—The Jury withdrew for an hour, and on their return into Court, delivered their verdict as follows:

James Haigh, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, John Walker, and Thos. Brook— *Guilty.*

The two latter were charged with firing at persons in the mill.

James Brook, John Brook, and John Hirst.— *Not Guilty.*

There was no prosecution against Wm. Hanson, of Elland, charged with being concerned in the robbery at Fartown.

THE EXECUTION.

On Friday, about nine o'clock in morning, Mellor, Thorpe, and Smith, ascended the scaffold: after some time being spent in prayer with the Ordinary, they *each* addressed themselves to the Almighty in a manner the most penitent. The voices of Thorpe and Smith were indistinct, few expressions were heard the spectators.— Mellor spoke in most audible manner; and if all his companions had heard him, must have hearts harder than flint, if they had not been melted into tears, and resolved, by spending the remainder of their life in repentance, to atone to their country for the dreadful injuries they have inflicted on her domestic tranquility.

After dwelling a long time the sins of his past life, which he confessed to be of the blackest nature, he said, "But THOU who cast devils out of Mary Magdalen,— THOU who pardonest the thief upon the Cross,—THOU canst still save thieves, — aye, and EVEN US POOR MURDERERS!" He prayed fervently for those who were connected with him.— That they might, from the present awful scene, be led to repent of their great sins, and cease from pursuing those lawless measures which could only tend to their eternal ruin. He said,—There are many here who have come expecting to see us die *game*! Let such know that we die *penitent!* We acknowledge the heinousness of our sins, and our only hope to be forgiven is the infinite and boundless mercy of our Redeemer.

After having thus made his confessions to the Almighty, he rose from his knees and addressed himself to the spectators in nearly the following words,—"There are many here whom I know,— a many of my enemies,—some who have urged me to the commission of the crime for which I am now to forfeit my life. I freely forgive you, and all the world, and I hope the world will forgive me."—These were his last words.

After hanging the usual time, their bodies were taken to the York County Hospital, to be dissected and anatomized, agreeable to their sentence.

The views of these deluded men are pretty clearly developed by the testimony of Hinchliffe, in the case of Scholefield. The latter told Hinchliffe, that "they were waiting to get a body of men within the liberty of  Holmfirth,— they had got such a body at Huddersfield, and they waited to get a body of men at all other places, and then they might all start, in a moment, and overturn the Government!"

Meetings were regularly held, and there were delegates from Manchester, Leeds, and other places.— Scholefield, to induce Hinchliffe to be LUD, told him, "that all the officers and men, except one serjeant, in a whole regiment, were *twisted in*; besides four of the Queen's bays!" Such were the schemes of these misguided men.
