YORKSHIRE LENT ASSIZES

...

Mr. Justice Le BLANC addressed the Grand Jury in nearly the following terms:—

"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY,  
"Assembled as we are at present in the ordinary discharge of a duty you have so often been called upon to perform; I should have felt it unnecessary to trouble you with any observations if a case had not occurred which seemed from its infrequency to require some notice. The list of offences, though somewhat longer than usual, does not appear to contain many cases of novelty, and I hoped to have had the pleasure of congratulating the County of York in having escaped the contagion of that system of depredation which has continued so long and occasioned such extensive mischief in a neighbouring county, but this hope has not been fully realised; I am grieved to find from a case in the Calendar, and from information received since we arrived here, that this county has not entirely escaped the influence of bad example; but I trust there will be found not only sufficient vigilance in the magistracy to suppress these disorders; but, also courage in the subjects, to protect their property from the attacks of these depredators. The advantages of machinery in manufacture has been so clearly proved, and the subject so ably discussed, that it excites surprize that any should be found so ignorant and infatuated as to imagine that the destruction of machinery should better the situation of the persons employed in manufactures. These absurd ideas have been refuted over and over again, not only by writers on the subject, but by the Judges in their different circuits, that one might have expected none could be found ignorant enough to be influenced by them, and I should have hoped no man would have been as wicked as to instil such mischievous notions into the minds of these deluded men. The Legislature has heretofore provided penalties and serious penalties for the protection of this species of property; all that is required is that the law should be put in force, which can only be by vigilance and courage in detecting offenders. I only find one case in the Calendar which has any refer to this subject, and that person, most fortunately for himself, was by the prompt exertions of a Magistrate arrested, perhaps before he had completed the offence. He will probably be prosecuted under some of the provisions of what is called the Black Act, an Act passed to repress certain enormities in the reign of George I. committed by persons armed and disguised by blacking their faces, and as prosecutions under this act are extremely rare, I take the liberty of pointing out to you the words of the Act, 'If any person or persons being armed with swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, and having his or their faces blacked, or being otherwise disguised, shall appear in any forest, park, &c. *or in any high road*, and shall be convicted thereof, they shall be adjudged guilty, of felony.'

"Two circumstances it will be observed are necessary to constitute this offence, that the person should be armed, and should be disguised by having his face blacked, and in the present instance perhaps it will appear, but of this you will judge when the case comes before you, that this person was discovered before the offence was completed, and that only one of these circumstances can be proved against him; he was evidently on the verge of committing a capital felony, from which he was, perhaps fortunately for himself, witheld by being taken into custody. You will therefore inquire not only as to his person being disguised, but as to the fact of his being armed with offensive weapons, as swords, fire-arms, or other weapons, calculated to injure or terrify his Majesty's subjects. I have presumed to make these observations because a case of this kind may not have come before you, and in a statute so extremely penal there ought to be satisfactory grounds for putting a person upon his trial before another Jury, who in such case will have ultimately to decide upon his guilt or innocence.

..."

The Bill against James Shaw, of Leeds, clothdresser, charging him with having disfigured his person by blacking his face, and with being unlawfully armed with offensive weapons, was thrown out, by the Grand Jury, on Wednesday; and he was, of course, discharged without being put upon his trial.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 20 January 1812

*Aslo reprinted in Manchester Mercury of Tuesday 21 January 1812, etc.*

The greatest praise is due to the Magistrates of this Borough, for their alacrity and prompt decision in striking at the root of a dangerous conspiracy, which, if carried into effect, would seem to bear a close affinity to the disturhances in Nottinghamshire. Indeed, we have little doubt, that an organized system prevails, and that something more than the distresses of the times, is the moving cause of these conspiracies. The Magistrates fortunately had timely information, that a meeting was to be held on Wednesday night, of certain cloth-workers and others, at a given place, and that they were to proceed to the destruction of the different machines, in the neighbourhood, used for the dressing of cloth. A meeting of this description was certainly held, but, from what cause we know not, the system of depredation was not commenced. The Magistrates were personally on the alert; and a little after one o'clock on Thursday morning, one of them seized a perion of the name of James Shaw, on his return from the unlawful assembly. He had his face blacked and was with a hammer and a club.— Several others returning at the same time, similarly armed, escaped. On the day following, the prisoner underwent a long examination in before the Magistrates, at our Rotation Office, when he was fully committed to York Castle, under the Black Act, for disguising his person and being found with offensive weapons,— A party of the Scots Greys escorted the prisoner three miles out of the town.

It might, however, seem that even this promptitude has been insufficient to stem the torrent of that dangerous spirit, to which we have alluded.

About seven o'clock, last night, (Sunday) the gig or dressing-mill of Messrs. Oates, situate near Woodhouse-Carr, was discovered to be ON FIRE! The flames spread with rapidity, and a great part of the building, about half, was destroyed.

On the alarm the Scots Greys hastened to guard the propertu, and thousands thronged to the spot; many lamenting the calamity, the multitude shouting and proclaiming it a blessing!

The day—the time of the day—the spirit which is afloat, stamp this as the act of incendiaries. It may not be so; we hope it is not so: but the general opinion goes against our probability and our hope.

Under such misfortunes, there is a satisfaction, which every provident man ought to secure himself; we are happy to say that the proprietors have in this instance secured it, *the property is fully insured*.

JAMES SHAW, the man apprehended at Leeds on the night of Wednesday the 15th of January with his face disfigured, was last week liberated from York Castle without trial, the Grand Jury having thrown out the bill. His offence did not come under the provisions of the black act; which requires not only that the face of the offender should be blacked, but that he should also be armed with "swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons." It must not be supposed, from this acquittal, that the laws are unequal to the punishment of those who assemble for the destruction of the property of their neighbours. This would be a dangerous supposition, and might lead to most fatal consequences. The laws are fully equal to the punishment of the guilty—but this particular statute did not apply to SHAW'S case; and in a country where law is not made to bend to expediency, a prisoner will always enjoy the advantage of any such variation, between the charge and the offence, as the humane discrimination of the Judge enabled him on the present occasion to point out.
