# And so it begins...

At the start of 1811, the pressure was on to try to reduce the costs of lace and hose manufacture. The prices per piece were fixed, but it seems that some manufacturers were looking to find ways around the traditional pricing, to the detriment of the people who worked for them, whilst others, or so it seemed, sought to do right by their workers:

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 26 January 1811

To the Editor of the NOTTINGHAM JOURNAL.

There appeared in your last week's paper an Advertisement, signed by a number of Manufacturers in this town, stating their disapprobation of any reduction in the prices of making Silk and Cotton Hose; we see amongst them the names of several Houses who have, for a length of time, been in the habit of making Women's Hose at the price of Slender Women's, and Slender Women's at the price of Maids', and other sizes in proportion; this, undoubtedly, is a reduction.— There are also others amongst them, who, under a pretence of leaving out the fashion, have considerably reduced the prices; we will just name one article— the standard price of Slender Women's, 30 guage, Cotton Hose is 17s. per dozen; this article is now making at 12s. per dozen, Welted, under the pretence of deducting 1s. for leaving out the shape, 1s. for being bound in down the leg, instead of being narrowed, and the remainder for having slit partings, in lieu of being spliced and leaving out the bindings in at the heel and beginning of the foot bottom; so that 5s. per dozen is deducted from the Workman, for work left out, which is not worth more to him than 3s. at the utmost; other qualities are also made on the same principle.

Now, we would ask those Gentlemen who thus publicly avow their disapprobation of reducing the price of making Hose, what they call this but a Reduction.—We have had much conversation with the Workmen on this subject, and they all say that the fashion thus left out is by no means adequate to the price deducted for it; in which opinion we most decidedly agree with them.

It is well known, that Stocking-makers who have frames of their own, or independent frames, have taken work at very reduced prices, for the sake of employment: this essentially injured both us and our Workmen; and it became necessary for us to consider, whether we would discharge our old Workmen, let our own frames stand still, and employ the independent frames at the reduced prices, or whether we would give our own Workmen the preference of work, at such a price as would enable us to cope with those Manufacturers who, by employing independent frames, and making their goods on the plans above described, have hitherto possessed such great advantages over us. These reasons, therefore, made it indispensable for us to reduce the price to our own Workmen, leaving it entirely at their oprtion, whether they would take the prices we offered them, or work on the same principle as the independent frames.

We have been told by some Gentlemen who have signed that Advertisement, that we should have followed the same system that others have done; then no notice would have been taken of it:—to which we answer, that, *never having been accustomed* to reduce the stated prices given by the Trade at large, by any such mode as making one size and paying for a less, we do not choose *now* to adopt such a measure.

It remains only for us to state, if these Gentlemen are really anxious to prevent any reduction in the price taking place, they will return to the old standard mode of making and paying for their Work; then there will not be found any Individual amongst them who will not pay the old price with greater pleasure than  
J. and T. WATSON, NELSONS and Co.  
CHURCHILL and PRICE.  
RICHARD EATON.  
BROCKSOPP and PARKER.

*It seems that despite their protestations against the reduction of wages, the signatories to that letter were also to reduce wages in the coming weeks.*

Six weeks later, and with prices paid falling, the workers start to take action in to their own hands... and the machine breaking begins...

RIOTOUS EXCESSES AT NOTTINGHAM.—It is with the deepest regret we have to communicate the occurrence of alarming disturbances and outrageous excesses in the neighbourhood of Nottingham. Letters from that place state, that on Tuesday last the workmen, to the number of one thousand, assembled in the market-place, and from thence proceeded in a body to Arnold, a distance of about five miles, when their numbers were increased to between two and three thousand. Thus augmented in strength, they shortly evinced a determination to adopt measures of violence, and parties proceeded to enter the houses and destroy the frames of several of the manufacturers. The cause assigned for these afflicting outrages was the extreme distress suffered by themselves and families, in consequence of the stoppage of work. With any further particulars we are at present unacquainted, but we have to express our sincere hopes that these mistaken men must have been soon made sensible that by the destruction of the property of others, they not only could not alleviate their own misery, but that, on the contrary, they must materially increase it.

Nottingham Review - Friday 15 March 1811

On Monday, some hundreds of framework-knitters from the county, assembled in the market-place; they loudly complained of those employers, who had set the example of reducing their earnings at this calamitous time. The constables were ordered out to preserve the peace; and a troop of dragoons paraded the market-place from three in the afternoon till after nine at night. But there was so little indication of riot, that the ordinary business of the fair was not interrupted. These sons of sorrow, however, seemed to have *method in their madness*, for when night drew on, and they found the alarm their appearance had created, had occupied the attention of the civil power, and given employment to the soldiery, they marched in good order to Arnold, about three miles from hence, where they destroyed about sixty frames belonging to those hosiers who had rendered themselves the most obnoxious to the workmen, without committing any other violence. On Tuesday evening, a party of dragoons was sent to Arnold, but the rioters had retired to the neighbouring villages, where the *(sic)* continued their depredations in frame breaking without molestation, nor have we, as yet, heard of any of them having been apprehended.--- On the 17th of June, 1779, about the same number of frames were broken at Arnold on a similar occasion, which caused the passing of a Bill, which was taken into the House of Commons by D. P. Coke, Esq. which makes it transportation wilfully to injure a stocking frame.

On Thursday last, before the Mayor, and Mr. Alderman Swann, the sitting Magistrates at the Guildhall, a Manufacturer of lace, concerned in employing persons in the said manufactory to work-up cotton yarn into lace, was convicted in, and paid the penalty of £10, for paying in goods, and not in money, one of his workmen, the wages, or prices greed on, for making a piece of cotton-lace, contrary to the Statute in such case made and provided; which penalty was by the said Justices appropriated as the Act directs.

The following, albeit brief, account of the gathering at Nottingham and consequent march to Arnold appeared in regionalpapers across the country:

RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM.— The *Statesman* of this Evening says:— "The following, we are sorry to state, we have received from unquestionable authority:— On Tuesday last the workmen, to the number of 1000, assembled in the market-place, Nottingham, and proceeded to Arnold, when they increased to more than 2000, and proceeded to the greatest violence, breaking open the houses and destroyingthe frames of the masters."— We have not learnt how this unfortunate circumstance has terminated.

The editor of the *Nottingham Journal* rued the events, and suggested to those responsible that they had not actually inconvenienced the intended target of their attack.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 16 March 1811

We are sorry to observe, that a disposition to riot and tumult has manifested itself amongst the operative manufacturers in this neighbourhood, owing to the present depressed state of trade, which has occasioned an abatement in the workmen's prices, and reduced them to the greatest distress.—A number of individuals from the adjacent villages assembled in this town on Monday last, with a view of representing to their employers the hardships they were subject to, and of intimidating others into a compliance with their demands, by which alone they would be enabled to obtain a subsistence for themselves and families. The assembling of such numbers induced an apprehension on the part of the Mayor and Magistrates, that some violation of the public peace was intended. They, therefore, adopted the most prompt and vigilant measures, by calling out the civil power, and ordering a troop of horse from the barracks, to be in readiness to act in case of necessity. But happily, in the evening, these precautions were rendered useless, by the whole retiring quietly to their homes.

In the neighbourhood of this place, however, we are concerned to say, that considerable mischief has been done, and the folly of a deluded multitude was, perhaps, never more conspicuous than at Arnold on Monday; when they proceeded with a premeditated determination to destroy some stocking frames employed there, by hosiers of this town, and rented by them of Mr. Bolton, who had retired from business above two years since, and had let his frames on a lease, and engaged to keep them in repair at his own expence; consequently the loss, which we hear will amount to several hundred pounds, will fall entirely upon Mr. Bolton.—The avowed motive of these people to commit acts of so flagrant a nature, was to injure the hosiers who rented the frames; but though they were told by the workmen, in whose hands the frames were, that they belonged to Mr. Bolton, whose name was stamped upon the front bars, they persisted in their determination, and nearly demolished upwards of fifty frames, intending by so doing, to suspend the manufactory until the frames could be repaired, to the prejudice of the hosiers who had engaged them on rent; whereas the fact is, that it will have quite a contrary effect, and be to their advantage, by enabling them to refrain from manufacturing more goods than are really wanted, until the demand for them shall increase.

[We find that, by the Act of the 28th of George III. chap. 55, the maliciously destroying or damaging any Stocking Frame is made felony.]

A week later, and it seems the attacks were continuing, this time a little further afield:

It is with great concern we hear, that the mischievous proceedings which took place at Arnold last week, have been extended to most of the manufacturing villages in the north western parts of this county, where upwards of one hundred stocking frames, the property of individuals, have been destroyed. These outrages are the more to be deprecated, since they will be attended with less evil to the proprietor, than to the unfortunate workman, who must for a length of time be thrown entirely out of employment.—The persons engaged in these depredations, proceed in small companies, disguised so that their persons may not be known; in some instances, however, their designs have been frustrated by the determined resistance of those who were in employ.—We hope, shortly to be able to announce a happy adjustment of the existing differences between the workmen and their employers.
```

A correspondent to the *Nottingham Journal* followed up the editorial comment of the week before by mildly chastising the mischief-making stocking makers, likening them to spoiled children, and calling on the employers to come together in a resolution that the workmen could not fail to see the sense of.

*To Persons concerned in the Nottingham Manufactory.*

It is alarming to hear of the mischief which has been done, and is yet doing, in the Villages around us, in almost every direction; and which seems likely to wear a more serious aspect.

Surely it is the duty of those in office to give full information to Government of these proceedings; that it may immediately take effectual measures to check designs which may yet be only in contemplation.

The folly of the Stocking Weavers, in destroying the Frames belonging to their masters (but many of them the property of persons no way concerned in the trade), is indeed most absurd and infamous.

It is the most effectual way of injuring themselves; by throwing out of work for months, or years, the machines by which they gain a livelihood.

It reminds us of children, who quarrel with their bread and butter, throw it into the dirt in a pet, and then cry because they have nothing to eat.

It is much to be regretted, that the Hosiers should avowedly be at variance at such a crisis.

If, instead of reproaching each other in the public prints, they would convene a GENERAL MEETING of the TRADE, and come to a decided Resolution on which to act, and publish the same with the signatures of their respective names at the foot, as has been the usual custom on similar occasions, there can be no doubt, when the Workmen saw these Resolutions, founded upon general consent, that they would consider it in vain to oppose the unanimous determination of their Employers, and quietly return to their work.

It would otherwise be "kicking against the pricks."

A few days later, in the *Nottingham Review*, a reward was offered for information leading to conviction; the same reward to be offered to anyone involved, whose pardon would also be sought.

The notice immediately following makes clear that at least one of the agents working for the manufacturers was deemed to be unreliable, although it is not clear how, but nevertheless, the pieceworkers he engaged were still liable for delivering their work directly back to the manufacturers, or it would be the worse for them.

We congratulate the public upon the vigorous proceedings adopted for putting an end to the shameful system of destroying frames, which has been lately pursued in this neighbourhood. In addition to the liberal rewards offered, some of the most active and intelligent Officers from Bow Street are now employed, and have been in the adjacent villages during the last week. Their known ability gives us every reason to expect, that an effectual stop will be put to the diabolical proceedings of a set of men, who, under the pretence of preventing an evil, have inflicted the most grievous injury upon their industrious neighbours, by depriving them of the means of obtaining bread for their families, and have brought on themselves the execration of all good men. The County Magistrates, we learn, have requested the continued services of these vigilant and indefatigable Officers, for an indefinite period. On this subject we cannot refrain from expressing our regret at the culpable apathy exhibited in the late tumultuous proceedings, in cases where the mischief was performed by ten or twelve individuals, in the presence of, perhaps, two or three hundred, who, by being spectators, became abettors in the mischief, and thus justly rendered themselves liable to punishment. We understand, that the County Magistrates have determined to punish with the utmost severity of the law, all persons who may be brought before them, for being present at any riotous and disorderly assemblage, where destruction of property has ensued.

And as to the rewards? As yet I have found no court proceedings, or guilty verdicts, and no mention of the rewards being claimed.

VIOLENT OUTRAGES.

We are concerned to state, that great discontents have again broken out amongst the operative manufacturers in various parts of this county, and that a most alarming system of mischief has been carrying on during the present week, at Bulwell, Sutton in Ashfield, and the intermediate villages. The depredations have been almost exclusively confined to the destruction of a certain description of stocking-frames, which, being of a new construction, are supposed by the workmen, likely to prove greatly injurious to the body at large. The town and parish of Bulwell has been a scene of the most violent outrages: on Sunday night last, a number of men, armed with various offensive weapons, attacked the house of one Hollingworth, who had become obnoxious on account of his having some frames at work on the new principle. The latter being apprised of their intention, procured the assistance of his brother-in-law and three or four friends, who, with fire arms, resolved to protect the property: a great many shots were exchanged, and one of the assailants, named John Westby (an inhabitant of Arnold), was mortally wounded. This unfortunate circumstance occasioned the mob to withdraw for a short time, with their wounded companion; but being joined in a lane at some distance from the spot, by fresh numbers, and Westby having expired on the road, they became so exasperated as to return to the attack with redoubled fury. They soon forced an entrance into the house, when the party within found it necessary to make a precipitate retreat, which they accomplished by means of a window at the back part of the house, leaving their fire arms behind them. The rioters, on entering the house, immediately proceeded to demolish the furniture, and in their fury they broke and destroyed every article in the house, together with the frames, the chief object of their vengeance, which they shivered to atoms.— On the following day the mob again collected, and having obtained information of some frames being on the road, belonging to two houses in this town, which the owners were removing from Sutton in Ashfield, they intercepted the waggon at Basford, and dragging the frames out, totally demolished them on the road, throwing part into the Leen. In a similar manner, we understand, the rioters destroyed seven other frames (five wide and two narrow ones), belonging to Job Bramley, which were coming to this town.—On Wednesday, several hundreds collected in the neighbourhood of Arnold, from whence they proceeded to Sutton in Ashfield, where the work of destruction was again commenced, and no less than 37 frames, including the whole in the possession of Francis Betts, were completely demolished.—Here, however, a stop was put to their career, by the arrival of a party of military, upon whose appearance the mob instantly dispersed in all directions.

Many persons concerned in these outrageous proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed to the county gaol to take their trials for the offence. They were brought in last night under an escort of the Bunny troop of yeomanry. Their names are John Bradbury, Gervas Marshall, George Green, and John Clarke.

The High Sheriff, with the most laudable zeal for the preservation of the public peace, has, with the advice of the County Magistrates, considered it expedient to call in the aid of the Holme-Pierrepont and Bunny troops of yeomanry cavalry, whose services, together with the detachment of the 4th dragoons, from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the first regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark troop of yeomanry are in readiness to act, in case of any further disposition to disturbance. The Magistrates are everywhere at their posts, and the greatest praise is due to them for their promptitude and exertions.

Every precautionary measure has been adopted by the Mayor and Magistrates for the preservation of the public peace in this town, and some hundreds of special constables have been sworn in.

The following account of the attack made on Hollingworth's house, at Bulwell, has been furnished us by the Coroner:—

"Between the hours of one and two on Monday morning last, a number of persons (it is supposed near 300), assembled before the house of Edward Hollingworth, at Bulwell, for the purpose of breaking the stocking frames in Mr. H.'s shop, who, being prepared to defend his property, several shots were fired upon the rioters, and they being also armed with fire arms, fired several shots in at Mr. H.'s windows, and forcing open the house door, the people within retreated up stairs, where they again defended themselves for some time; the people below firing several shots up the stairs, and finding themselves unable to get up stairs, they began to pull down the partition wall which supported the chamber floor, and by that means let the floor down, threatening to murder every man that was in the chamber. Mr. H. and his assistants now seeing they were not able to protect the property in the house, and finding that the rioters would get the floor down, they made their escape through the chamber window, on the back side of the house. The doors, windows, household furniture, and several stocking frames, were all destroyed. Soon after day-light the same morning, the body of John Westby, a framework-knitter, an inhabitant of Arnold, was found dead near the highway upon Bulwell Forest, a short distance from Mr. H.'s house; and on the 12th an inquest was taken on view of the body before Thomas Wright, Gent. Coroner, when it was found that a ball had entered on the left side, a little below the navel, passed through the body, and came out just under the short rib on the right side near the spine. Verdict, *That he died of the wound as above justifiably given by the said Edward Hollingworth, or others his assistants, in defence of himself, his family, house, and property*."

The deceased, we understand, has left a wife and two children.

The troubles in Nottinghamshire were notable enough for them to reported in the London based *Morning Post*, which gave a summary of the events of the previous week, framed as a reponse of the workers to a decrease in available work caused by the introduction of labour-saving wide frames.

SERIOUS RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM.

A riotous spirit has of late been manifested, by the Manufacturers having brought into use a certain wide frame, for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, by which was produced a considerable saving in manual labour, tending still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday night last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinty of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage and riot, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as had in use those particular frames, so obnoxious to them.

A master-weaver, at Bullwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday evening armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being thus in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who did not leave him long in suspense, till they appeared and demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames; the master would subscribe to neither, and was immediately fired upon; several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life, he was in the act of *storming* the houses, or, in other words, *tearing down* the window-shutters, to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength and violence. They immediately broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death, had they not made their escape out at the back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed everything that would burn by fire.

On the Tuesday the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to MALBY and BREWETT, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they broke to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the open street.

Other letters we have seen state that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob, belonged to Messrs. WATSON and NELSON, and produced twenty-four dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.

In the afternoon of Tuesday the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages in that quarter, and in the course of that evening they broke and destroyed the frames there of the principal weavers.

On Wednesday morning, not having finished their work, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill; for now, having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, the mob grew more emboldened, and changed the frame breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide frames, millers, corn-dealers, and all others concerned in raising the price of bread.

On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace-breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the *posse comitatis*, and the 1st and second regiments of local militia, and a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three o'clock on Friday morning.

All Thursday was employed in assembling together the militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriffs, during the while the mob were enabled to carry on thepredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town wasleft for a moment unprotected, they would make a suddent attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.

Our last advices are to nine o'clock on Friday morning, at which time intelligence had just been received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberly, because they were worked by women. The Local Militia were under arms, and the *posse comitatis* in readiness, but violent measures would not be proceeded in until fresh assistence and advice were received from Government.

By the end of the week, the editor of the *Nottingham Review* wrote not of furhter outbreaks of violence, but in some sort of defence of the framework-knitting trade, and against the introduction of low quality "cut up" work. He also identified what he saw as the root cause of the current distress: the ongoing war.

Nottingham Review - Friday 22 November 1811

"The framework-knitting trade of this country, in all its various branches, is of considerable importance in a national point of view, and consequently merits the fostering hand of legislative, as well as individual protection; for it stands pre-eminent in all the markets in the world, where the productions thereof are vendable articles; consequently if it be suffered to work itself into disgrace, for want of legislative protection, the result will be a national evil, as well as be the ruin of some of the most flourishing towns, and an immense number of villages, in the kingdom; that is to say, they *flourish* when the rulers of the earth permit the markets thereof to be open to competition. Then let us hope that every facility will be given to an application to Parliament, by the wealthy, that they have in their power to give, to prevent *cut-up* goods from being made. But while we propose measures to prevent future calamities, let us not forget to propose something to remove those that now afflict this neighborhood, as well as every other part of the kingdom, though not at the present time, in the same alarming degree; and what so likely to produce so desirable an effect as petitioning the Prince Regent for peace. From war spring our greatest evils, as from peace would flow our greatest good! Then why not attempt the attainment of so desirable an object? the panacea for all our suffering. The enemy has made various overtures for peace, since the re-commencement of hostilities, which have been invariably rejected by our government, without any overtures having been made on the part of England since the ever-to-be-lamented death of the immortal Fox. It may be said, that the enemy is impervious to a peace, honorable to this country; but how do we know that to be the case? have we made overtures for peace which he has rejected? certainly not! then till we have done so, let us be content to rest part of the blame of the war's continuance upon our own shoulders; and not like a man, when smarting under the lash of his own imprudence, that lays the cause of his folly at the door of another. But perhaps the Prince may not know the full extent of distress to which the country is reduced by the war; then ought not the manufacturer and the workman to join heart and hand in promoting petitions to him, in which might be explained the full extent of our grievances, and the proper remedy pointed out?"

The following day, the *Nottingham Journal* commented on the period of relative calm that appeared to have settled in the county, putting it down to a forceful reposnse from the Magistrates and the military.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 23 November 1811

Nottingham, Friday, Nov. 22.

The lawless and outrageous proceedings which we had the painful duty of recording in our last, have, in a great degree, subsided, owing to the vigorous and decisive measures adopted by the High Sheriff and the Magistrates, aided by the military. Since the apprehension of some of the most active of the rioters, and the assemblage of a considerable military force, the mischievous designs of the more violent have been effectually restrained, and no further attempt to disturb the public peace has been made. Only one instance of frame-breaking has come to our knowledge since our last, and that took place at a house in Acomb Lane, Old Radford, on Monday night last, where one wide frame was broken to pieces. Many threats, however, have been held out against others; and on Tuesday night, in consequence of a stone being thrown through the window of a workshop which was threatened at New Radford, a part of the guard of the Local Militia marched to garrison the house, and also another, which had been threatened in like manner, while the remainder of the guard continued to patrole the road throughout the night, and thus the property was effectually preserved.— It would appear, however, that the frame breaking employment has, for the present been changed for one of a more diabolical nature; on Saturday night last, some vile incendiary set fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Stirrup, of the Swan Inn, Mansfield, by which nearly 20 tons of hay were destroyed. This act of diabolical mischief is supposed to have been perpetrated by some desperate characters out of revenge to Mr. Stirrup, in consequence of having furnished post horses to a party of seven dismounted dragoons, who proceeded with some of the Mansfield yeomanry to suppress the riots at Sutton in Ashfield. A similar revenge was taken on Monday night, by setting fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Lewis. of Snenton, near this town, whose son is a member of the Holme-Pierrepent troop of yeomanry, which was last week called out on duty; and on Tuesday night last, two hay ricks, the property of Mr. Hardstaff and Mr. Toon, at Hucknall Torkard in this county, were maliciously set on fire and destroyed.

The first regiment of Nottinghamshire Local Militia assembled here on Friday last under the command of Lieut. Col. Wright, and have remained on duty every since. It reflects infinite credit on the corps, that at so alarming a crisis there is scarcely a man absent but what can be accounted for. A Captain's guard is mounted every night.

The dragoons at the barracks have been strengthened by a small detachment of the Scots' Greys, from Lichfield.

On Wednesday a squadron if the 15th dragoons (hussars) arrived here from Colchester, and yesterday morning detachments of them were sent to Mansfield, and the villages in this neighbourhood, where they are for the present to be stationed.

Yesterday se'nnight, an express arrived from the High Sheriff of this county, for the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry to muster at Red Hill, near this town, with all possible speed, to assist in quelling the disturbances which have taken place in this neighbourhood. The troop mustered with an alacrity which does them the greatest credit, and arrived at the place appointed by half past four o'clock in the afternoon, where they halted and formed into line. There appearing no disposition to riot that night, and the Bunny troop being upon the ground, they returned to Southwall until further orders, which arrived on Saturday at noon, for their return home. They mustered eighty-three strong.

We are authorised to state, in contradiction to the assertion in the *Review* of last week, that instead of nearly 300 of the mob, which proceeded from Arnold to Sutton in Ashfield, being armed with fire-arms, there were not more than 20 that had weapons of that description.

Seventy miles or so to the north, an editorial comment in the *Leeds Mercury* spoke out against the violence, but also identified the war as the real cause of the situation the workers' found themselves in.

Editorial in the Leeds Mercury

We are more concerned than surprised to find, that a Spirit of Riot and Insubordination has broken out in the county of Nottingham amongst the suffering Manufacturers. As it frequently happens on such occasions, the cause of the distress of these unfortunate people is mistaken; they imagine, it seems, that the low rate of wages and the scarcity of work arise from some improvement in the Stocking weaving Frames, and their vengeance is directed against the owners of these inoffensive implements of labour; but they ought to be informed that the real cause of the evils of which they so loudly and justly complain, is the long continuance of a heart-sickening war, without visible object, and apparently without end, and which has in its consequences damied up all the regular outlets of trade; and if instead of sacking the workshops of their employers, who are in general deep participators in the sufferings of the labouring classes, they would unite with the other manufacturers throughout the kingdom in petitioning the proper authorities, first to inform them what it is we are fighting for; and secondly, if the object does not justify the sacrifices, to put a stop to the horrors and miseries of this contest, they would act much more wisely and have a much better chance of seeing an end of their grievances, than by their present lawless and senseless proceedings. We do most sincerely commisserate their situation, but we utterly condemn the means by which they seek to obtain redress.

Elsewhere in the that same edition of the paper, we see the same report that had previously appeared in the *Morning Post* at the start of the week, although in this case the report appears to be credited to a correspondent from Nottingham, who had perhaps sent the same letter to the *Morning Post*?

RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM

For some time past the Wholesale Hosiers, who have Stocking-weaving Establishments in the county of Nottingham, have been obliged to curtail their hands; this produced considerable discontent among the workmen. Their riotous spirit was, however, increased by the trade having brought into use a certain wide frame for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, which, was a considerable saving in manual labour, leading still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday se'nnight last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinity of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as used particular frames.

A letter dated Nottingham, the 14th inst. communicates, that the late hands in particular were in a very distressed situation, and under the necessity of applying for parochial relief. A master weaver, at Bullwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday, armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames. The master would agree to neither, and was immediately fired upon ;- several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life he was in the act of *tearing* down the window-shutters to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength. They broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death had they not escaped by a back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed every thing that would burn.

On Tuesday, the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to Maltby and Brewett, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they took to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the street.

Other letters state, that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob belonged to Messrs. Watson and Nelson, and produced 24 dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.

In the afternoon of Tuesday, the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages there; and that evening they destroyed the frames of the principal weavers.

On the Wednesday morning, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill.— Having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, they grew bolder, and changed the frame-breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide-frames, millers, corn-dealers, &c.

On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the *posse comitatis*, and the First and Second Regiments of Local Militia, an a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three on Friday morning.

All Thursday was employed in assembling together the Militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriff; during this time the mob were enabled to carry on their depredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town was left for a moment unprotected they would make a sudden attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.

On Friday morning intelligence was received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberley, because they were worked by women.

Many persons concerned in these proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed.

The High Sheriff, with the advice of the County Magistrates, has called in the Home Pierrepoint, and Bunny troops of Yeomanry Cavalry, whose services, with a detachment of the 4th Dragoons from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the First Regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry are in readiness to act. The Magistrates are every where at their posts. Some hundreds of special Constables have been sworn in.

On Thursday the body of *John Westley* a native of Leicester, the man who was shot in Sunday night at Bulwell, was removed to Arnold for interment, where he has resided for about twelve years; and where he has left two orphans, one five and the other three years of age, to bewail his untimely end: their mother having been dead some time. In the afternoon the funeral took place, and the scene was truly awful. The High Sheriff, the Under Sheriff, and about half a dozen Magistrates were on the spot, attended by a *posse* of Constables, and about thirty mounted Dragoons, who all proceeded with the funeral to the church-yard; but before the body was removed the Riot Act was read in several parts of the town. From seven hundred to a thousand persons attended on the occasion: the corpse was preceded by a number of the deceased's former club mates, bearing black wands, decked with knots of crape,—Sorrow seemed to have seated itself upon every brow, and a solemn silence, still as death, was only interrupted by the trampling of the multitude, the bell's heavy knoll, and a band of music playing a solemn dirge, accompanied at distant intervals by the beating of a bass drum !! About the time that the corpse was lowering into the grave, the High Sheriff proclaimed that an hour had elapsed since the reading of the Riot Act, and informed the multitude, that those who did not instantly disperse, should be taken into custody as rioters; and two were actually seized who did not immediately obey, but we believe, were shortly set at liberty; and the whole concourse quietly disbursed. Many more we understand were wounded in the various conflicts, and reports have stated several others to have lost their lives, but which reports, we hope are unfounded.

The most recent accounts from Nottingham left that town and neighbourhood free from tumult, in consequence of the strong military force assembled in that quarter. The workmen still, however, urge their complaints and what they call their rights. At a late meeting, held at the sign of the Sir Isaac Newton, the frame-work knitters came to several resolutions: among others, that their earnings as frame-knitters were inferior to those of any other class of mechanics: that the present grievances were as much to be attributed to the *irresolute* conduct in themselves, in not standing forward for the rights of the trade, as to an imposing principle on the part of their employers; and that they would resist impositions in future. On the 18th inst. another meeting was to take place, but we have not learnt the result.

Although there had been hopes that the outbreaks of violence had subsided, the attacks resumed on the weekend of November 23rd/24th, 1811.

Nottingham Review - Friday 29 November 1811

We stated a hope in our last, that the violence exercised in this neighbourhood in the breaking of stocking frames, was about subsiding, but in that respect we have been deceived; and we have now again the painful duty to perform, of recording renewed acts of aggression. And though from the various rumours which are daily coming to our ears, it is impossible to pledge ourselves for the critical exactness of our narrative, yet we believe the following will be pretty near the truth, respecting the riotous occurrences of the week:—

On Saturday night, one frame was broken at Ilkiston, the first town on the verge of Derbyshire from hence; but, from both coercive and conciliatory measures being resorted to, we believe the mischief has been stopped; for we have not heard of any acts of aggression being committed there since. On the same night, one frame was broken, in an otherwise empty house, in Cyprus-street, Nottingham; it being the first instance of the kind in this place for many years. Five others in York-street, and one on Mount East, were broken on Monday night, notwithstanding a party of special constables parade the streets every night. In consequence of these acts of outrage, and applications being made for protection by several persons who considered their property in danger, the Mayor and Aldermen issued out a spirited handbill, stating that they had ordered a number of constables to be in constant readiness at the Police office, for the immediate protection of any of the inhabitants that applied; since which time, no outrages have been committed in the town. In the neighbourhood, however, this has not been the case; for, at Carlton, one frame was broken Wednesday night, and many others prevented from sharing the same fate, by the timely appearance of a party of dragoons. At Chilwell, one was broken and the woodwork burnt on Monday morning: and report states, that several have been destroyed, in course of the week, at Hucknall Torkard, Bulwell, Dob Park, Eastwood, &c. But Basford has been the principal scene of action; for, notwithstanding the presence of both the civil and military powers, thirty one frames were destroyed on Sunday night, twenty on Monday night, thirteen on Tuesday night, and six on Wednesday night; and at noon on the latter day, one was broken near Red Hill, as it was coming under an escort of dragoons from Arnold to Nottingham, the soldiers, avoided proceeding to extremities, not having the power to obstruct the rioters in their determined purpose.

An intelligent and respectable correspondent at Basford has favored us with the following circumstances, and desires a place for them in our home news, as illustrative of the temper and disposition of the rioters:—

"One house that they went into, they had much trouble to obtain a light; and, while rummaging a cupboard for something with which to procure one, they discovered some plate and other valuables; but, having obtained a bit of paper, they shut to the cupboard door, nor touched any thing in the house but the frames, which were the object of their vengeance. In another house it was well understood, that from fifty to seventy golden guineas were kept by the master; but, having exercised their wrath upon the obnoxious IRON, they left the GOLD in quiet possession of the owner. At another house, the master offered them a considerable portion of money if they would spare the frames; but their answer was, that they wanted not his money, but the destruction of those instruments which prevented them from obtaining a livelihood in an honest manner. One poor man begged of the rioters to spare two frames that had been the fruit of his industry for many years: his request was granted."

In the course of the week several persons have been brought in by the soldiers, on suspicion of being concerned in the breaking of frames; they were all liberated except one, and he is not committed.

The Nottingham Local Militia, under the command of Lientenant-Colonel Wright, was disembodied on Wednesday last; and we are happy to state, that the conduct of the men, while on duty, has been such as to merit the approbation both of their officers and the inhabitants of the town at large. On their departure, the military duty of the town, which is considered indispensible at the present moment, was performed by the Recruiting Staff, by order of Colonel Grey, the Commander of the District, until relieved by a division of the Southwell Local Militia, under the command of Captain Taylor, who marched in here on Thursday evening.

We are likewise happy in having to, state, that several of our hosiers have given notice to their workmen, that they will not have any more CUT-UP goods made; while others have stated their intention of paying the usual prices for making stockings. Messrs. Lacy and Seals, Lace Manufacturers, have published a hand-bill, announcing their determination of paying, what is considered at the present time, the standard price for making net, and likewise that of taking the regular rent for frames.

Just before our paper was sent to press, we learnt, that four frames were last night broken at Basford, and their woodworks burnt. Five frames were also destroyed the same evening at Bobbers Mill.

## Respite In Nottingham...

At the start of December, a meeting was held on Wednesday, December 4th, 1811, at which it was declared that if the peace were restored, an accommodation would be found with the workers. Publicans would also be required to shut up shop by 10pm, meaning that if you were out later than that, you were obviously up to no good...

A Coroner's report at the end of the extract below shows that is was not just frame breakers who were aborad at night with guns secreted about their person, but poachers too...

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 07 December 1811

We feel much satisfaction in being enabled to state, that the differences between the workmen and their employers, in the hosiery and lace trades, which have of late caused so much agitation in this town and neighbourhood, and occasioned the destruction of such an immense property in frames, are at length in a fair train of accommodation. On Wednesday a very numerous meeting of the hosiers and lace manufacturers took place, when it was resolved, that as soon as "it shall be clearly manifested that the peace of the county and town is restored, the trade in general are willing and desirous to receive and consider proposals from their workmen, for the purpose of removing any grievances which may appear to exist." A notification to this effect was immediately made by the issuing of hand-bills, and ordered, for the better information of the public, to be publicly advertised. This declaration, we most ardently hope, will be received by the workmen as a satisfactory pledge that every thing will be done, consistent with reason, in their favour, and that the mischievous proceedings which have so long disgraced this neighbourhood, will be finally put a stop to.

The destructive intentions of the frame-breakers have considerably relaxed within the last two days; but, towards the latter end of last week, and at the beginning of this, the work of destruction seemed to assume an increased activity, notwithstanding the unremitting vigilance of the civil and military powers. On Thursday night last three frames were broken to pieces at Bobbers' Mill; and the following night 16 others shared the same fate at Beeston, and 12 at Blidworth. On Sunday evening, at an early hour, 4 frames out of 6 were broken in a work-shop, at New Radford. Exclusive of these, 1 very valuable lace frame, said to be worth upwards of £90, belonging to a house in this town, which had not conformed with the regulation of working by the rack, has also been destroyed; and 3 others, employed by another house in the making of single press lace, have shared the same fate. We understand also, that many frames have been broken during the night at Pentridge, Heage, South Wingfield, Ikeeston, Sheepshead, &c. The secrecy and precaution with which the persons engaged in these practices carry on their operations, have hitherto rendered it a matter of impossibility to take them in the fact. They go out in small parties, disguised, with their faces besmeared, and stationing centinels at the doors, accomplish their purpose without the least noise: they communicate with each other by means of a watch-word, and the firing of a pistol, or gun, is generally the signal of danger, or of retreat.

A party of frame-breakers, who had entered a workshop in Rutland Street, on Tuesday night last, had a very narrow escape from being taken: during the time they were engaged in their felonious purpose, a party of military came up, headed by a Magistrate, who cut off their retreat by the way they entered, when the party, seeing no other means of escape, made their way through a back window, and over the roof of an adjoining building, from whence they were seen descending into a back yard, and being closely pursued, were obliged to force their way through a house into the street.

The Magistrates issued an order in the early part of the week, requiring all publicans in the different towns and villages of this county, to shut up their houses by ten o'clock at night, and to give notice to the constable of the parish of all strangers that might be therein at that hour, on pain of having their licences taken from them. All persons are likewise prohibited from being out of their houses after ten o'clock at night.—A similar order has been issued by the Town Magistrates.—(*See adv.*

Patroles of constables nightly parade the streets of this town, to prevent any infraction of the public peace.

The 15th light dragoons have had a most harassing and fatiguing duty to perform since their arrival; but they have conducted themselves with great humanity, and the most exemplary discipline. One troop has been sent to Loughborough.

The detachment of the 2d Southwell regiment of Local Militia, which marched into this town last week, has been charged with the duty of guarding the military stores, since Friday last, and has on various occasions been employed in aid of the civil power, and in guarding the property of persons threatened.

We are authorised to state, that the General of the District has communicated to the Commanding Officer of the 1st regiment of Nottinghamshire Local Militia, that the Commander in Chief has been pleased to express his entire approbation of the conduct of the regiment during the period of its late assembly at Nottingham, in aid of the Civil power.

On the 1st instant, Edward Sutton, an inhabitant of this town, was found dead in a ditch, in the parish of West Bridgford, near this place. In his coat pocket was found a gun, so constructed that the butt-end could be taken off, the more conveniently to carry it in a concealed manner, a quantity of powder and shot, an engine called a snare, for destroying game, and wire and string for the purpose of making more. It is supposed that the gun went off by accident, as his waistcoat on the left breast was much discoloured by the powder; the shot had entered the left temple, torn off a piece of the skull, and taken away part of the brains.—Verdict of the Coroner's Jury, *accidental death*.
```

In the *Nottingham Review* of December 6th, 1811, we seen an interesting editorial comment regarding the motivation of the frame breakers, and is perhaps one of the clearest statements of why the action of the Nottinghamshire Luddites was *not* driven by a hatred of new machinery. If anything, it seems closer to a desire a resist what Cory Doctorow has termed *enshittification*.

Nottingham Review - Friday 06 December 1811

REVIEW OFFICE.

The distracted state to which Nottingham and its neighbourhood are reduced, has drawn forth the animadversions of many political writers of the day, amongst whom the Editor of the London Evening Chronicle, stands not the least conspicuous. His love of country, and sympathy for the sufferers, are evidently set forth in his remarks on this alarming and interesting subject; but his want of information, as to the immediately operating cause of these troubles, (though the war is the real and remote one) is not the less manifest: and while we endeavour to set him to rights, we shall use every explanatory effort in our power, to unfold the cause alluded to, which our abilities, and our very contracted limits for such a subject, will permit.

The two propositions which this writer assumes as the cause of these disturbances are, first, the criminally prevailing passion of our countrymen and countrywomen, for goods of foreign manufacture, while those manufactured at home are held in corresponding disrepute—and second, the invention of new machinery, which facilitates the production of goods, and consequently not only reduces the price of making them, but leaves many workmen destitute of employment. The first proposition, we are constrained to acknowledge, is correct: and where is the man, who can view, without feelings of the deepest regret and indignation, the wealthy decorated in the manufactures of the enemy, while our own artisans and mechanics are pining through want, and driven to the commission of crimes by neglect and desperation? men too, to whose industry the British Empire in part owes her commercial greatness, and whose genius stands pre-eminent in the landscape of the world. Those who are guilty of this conduct, we are ready to call traitors; for is not that man a traitor, and that woman a traitoress, who anyway adds to the strength of the enemy, in particular when that is done at the expense of the happiness, the consideration, and strength, of our own country. A matricide is held in abhorrence both by the laws of God and man, and his pardon, from an earthly throne, is not to be obtained: but what is the crime of a man killing his mother, to that of stabbing our country to the heart, the parent of a whole nation? Between the two crimes there is scarcely a parallel to be drawn; yet for the criminal in one case, it would be considered an insult to solicit for mercy; while the other wears the badge of his or her guilt in open day, and triumphs in it with impunity. We shall add no more on this subject, as we dwelt on it at considerable length in a former paper, when descanting on the Prince's fete.

As to the second proposition of the Editor of the London Chronicle, it is founded upon false premises; *for there is no new machinery in Nottingham, or its neighbourhood, against which the workmen direct their vengeance*. Nottingham stands *second* to none in the kingdom for the *invention* of new machinery, which has added so much to the country's manufacturing superiority, while it stands the *last* on the list for the *destruction* of the works of genius: there not being an instance in its history of the violence of the workmen being directed against the improvements in its machinery. The inhabitants of Nottingham know better: they have more of national utility in their eye; and they ought, and shall be, rescued from so foul a reproach; a reproach, that if well founded, would attach itself to the understanding, and not to the operative principles of the heart.

The machines, or *frames*, as they are called in the manufacturing dialect, are not broken for being upon any new construction, for they are not, but in consequence of goods being wrought upon them which are of little worth, are deceptive to the eye, are disreputable to the trade, and therefore pregnant with the seeds of its destruction. It is true, the obnoxious frames of the plain kind are generally wider than is necessary for the making of a stocking, and as such are employed by some of the hosiers in making pieces which are cut up into gloves, socks, sandals, or stockings, according as they want these respective articles; which articles, through their being thus cut and shaped with scissors, are deprived of proper loop selvages, and of the means of being seamed with a lacy seam; and instead thereof, are stitched together in the same manner as a tailor stitches a garment. And in consequence of the loopy nature of the stocking frame manufacture, which in fact constitutes its peculiar beauty and applicability for the uses to which it is applied, the cut selvages give way, and the stockings, &c. thus made, immediately become useless; and of course the good ones themselves, by keeping bad company, lose their repute in the market. To this may be added, through these articles, being prepared for sale in the manner they are, they can be wrought much cheaper, as more can be produced in a given time than can be of those goods that are made in an honorable way, which is productive of two more serious evils, namely, first, more goods are brought into market, which is already overstocked, therefore, many persons are thereby cast upon the parishes, that would otherwise continue to be useful members of society; and secondly, those that are employed to make hose, &c. in a tradesman-like manner, are either compelled to make them for less money than usual, or lose their employment altogether; either of which alternatives produces a farther accumulation of the parish burdens, and consequently an increase of human misery.

There is a principle interwoven in the genuine formation and contexture of the framework-knitted stocking, so connected with its credit, that if the former be destroyed, the latter will eventually fail. It was this interwoven principle that caused the government of Queen Elizabeth, of Charles the Second, and George the Third, to patronise and grant legislative protection to the framework-knitting trade; nor has it been ungrateful for these favors and protection; for though France, Spain, Holland, Venice, and various States of Germany have courted its smiles, and sought to rival the stocking-makers of England; yet the latter have always stood pre-eminent, whose numbers, a short time ago, amounted to twenty-five thousand, and gave employment to four times as many in the various branches of the trade. And in England, this trade will ever remain pre-eminent, except the nurselings of its own bosom eat out its vitals by their own ungenerous acts. If cut-up stockings are to be tolerated, we may as well proclaim a new aera in the trade, and let tailors and milliners take measure of our legs.

If proof was wanting of the mischief resulting from imposing spurious articles upon the public, such proof may be found in an ample degree by casting out eyes upon that branch of the framework-knitting trade called the *cotton point net lace*. In 1807, about seven hundred frames were employed in this branch alone, while at the present time, the number is not more than two hundred; and why? not because lace had gone out of fashion, by a regular change in those articles of dress to which *cotton point* was applied, for the superlativeness of the cotton yarn of which it was made, and the firmness and beautiful contexture of the mesh were such, as to ensure it universal and lasting esteem; but through the public being imposed upon by an article that resembled it in nothing but show; one of which was wrought in the same manner as the genuine net, but made of single yarn; another that was made of double yarn of an infinitely inferior quality, but wrought without fastening the loops, an and thus obtained the name of SINGLE-PRESS; and, that means might not be wanting to complete the climax of the disgrace and consequent ruin of so valuable a branch of the Nottingham manufacture, a third sort was made of single yarn and the unfastened and deceitful mesh. What was wanting of real worth in these spurious articles, was attempted to be made up with STARCH in the getting-up of the net, and with the gloss of the vendor's tongue, till the *atmosphere* unriddled the first mystery, and the dear-bought experience of the public, the second. These vile arts were first resorted to by a few adventurers, as destitute of honor, as the article they made were destitute of real worth, and the respectable part of the manufacturers were obliged to follow the example in their own defence.

After a proof like this, and others that are daily pressing upon our notice, of the evils arising to the trade of the town for want of legal means to control the unprincipled, and protect the upright tradesman, it is more than the risible muscles can support with gravity; to hear men, who are in some respects, esteemed for their understanding, advance propositions like this, "never mind these things, for trade, like water, will find its level." If trade were made up of no materials but WATER, this doctrine might be passable; but as that is not the case, it reminds us of a debauchee who replied, when solicited by his friends to apply for medical aid to repair the breach made in his constitution, by his vicious conduct, "never mind my constitution, for, as it is regulated by nature's course, it will find its own level." It did so, and the level that it found was the GRAVE; while his friends, whose support depended upon the purity of his conduct, found their LEVEL in a WORKHOUSE."

Nottingham Review - Friday 06 December 1811

*THERE has now existed in the neighbourhood of NOTTINGHAM, for a considerable Time, a most outrageous Spirit of Riot and Tumult.--- Houses have been feloniously broken into, and a great number of Stocking Frames has been violently broken and destroyed by an armed Multitude, accompanied with Menaces to the Lives of those, who should endeavour to interfere in preventing the Mischief; various threatening Letters have been sent, Arms have been feloniously demanded and seized, Stacks have been fired, and private Property destroyed; and Contributions have been levied under the Pretence of Applications for charitable Relief, but under the real Influence of Terror; these are acts of so flagrant a nature, and leading to Insurrection and such fatal Consequences, that the Magistrates of the County and Town of NOTTINGHAM, as the legal Guardians of the public Peace, have the Duty incumbent upon them, of suppressing the Evil by the civil and military Force of the Country, and by putting the Laws in execution on the Offenders, many of whom have committed Crimes, for which the Law demands on their conviction, the Forfeiture of their Lives.*

The Magistrates require that the Public peace shall be kept, and that if any violation of it shall take place, to the great disgrace of the County and Town, all Persons shall exert themselves in detecting and bringing to justice the Offenders; they feel themselves also bound distinctly to state, that the Persons who are Collecting Money, under whatever pretence, for the manifest purpose of supporting a system of outrage, under the influence of terror, are guilty of Felony; And that all those who Contribute, under any such impression, are Accessories to the Offence, and guilty of a high Misdemeanour against the Public peace. Having expressed this, they call upon all Persons of every description, firmly to refuse and discountenance Contributing to purposes so wicked and illegal; and it is their firm determination to Prosecute for every contempt of this Notice.

GEO. SCULTHORPE.

Nottingham Review - Friday 06 December 1811

Vague indeed and devoid of sensibility must be the mind, that can contemplate the progress of internal commotion, without feeling alarmed at its dread consequences, and for its fatal result: in particular when it is every hour extending its ramifications and gaining new strength at every advancing step.

A fortnight ago we fondly contemplated that the disturbances were nearly at an end; but, while they appeared to be dead, they were only acquiring organization, and have since obtained considerable extension. We shall therefore cease to predict, and shall content ourselves with condemning the measures, and narrating the events: the public now expecting a narrative of these events every week at our hands, as much as the Londoners expect a return of the price of bread from the Lord Mayor; in which narrative we shall give the best information in our power. On Friday night last, 18 frames were broken at Beeston, 9 at Blidworth, and 1 of great value at New Basford. On Saturday night, 1 at the latter place, 2 at Bobber's mill, 1 at Old, and one at New Radford. And on Sunday night, notwithstanding the unceasing activity of both the civil and military authorities, 1 in Butler's-court, Narrow-marsh, and 1 at the back of South-street, in this town, were destroyed; and on the same evening, 8 at New Radford. On Monday night, 2 in Currant-street, Turn-calf-alley, and 1 in Warren-court, Old-street, in this town; 2 at Snenton, and 5 at New Radford. On Tuesday evening, at nine o'clock, 1 was destroyed in Rutland-street, and through the vigilance of the civil power, the depredators were nearly being caught in the very act, for so closely were they pursued, that they narrowly escaped through a window, and went over several houses.

But the flame has now extended itself into the heart of the two neighbouring counties of Leicester and Derby; for at Sheepshead, in the former county, about 20 frames were destroyed on Tuesday night; and on the succeeding night, as we are informed, the spirit of commotion seemed to be actively at work in Loughborough, but whether any mischief was done, we have not yet been informed: a strong guard was placed for the protection of the twisted lace manufactory at that town, belonging to Messrs Lacy and Heathcoat. In Derbyshire the rioters have been very active, have displayed much violence, and much prudence as far as prudence can be connected with lawless authority. For, while at Ilkiston, about 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week, only 2 have been destroyed in the upper part of the country, that is, 1 at South Wngfield, and 1 in the hamlet of Wessington, which took place on Sunday night: while, from the formidable appearance of the rioters at Pentridge on the same night, which place is in the same neighbourhood, much mischief was expected to be done. But, after passing through the village, and examining the frames, and their holders, as to the work they made and the prices they received, they retired without doing any mischief or taking any thing away, to the no small joy of the inhabitants, but particularly to the farmers who expected nothing short of universal pillage. The object of the rioters in that quarter has however been gained; for, according to the testimony of our informant, the *Derbyshire* Hosiers have, in their individual capacities, promised to give what is known as the *old Derbyshire price*: indeed we have a printed bill by us, dated the 2d December, with the proprietors' names attached to it which says "THIS FRAME (meaning the frame upon which it is stuck) IS MAKING FULL FASHIONED WORK, AT THE FULL PRICE." This act of prudential concession on the part of these Hosiers, has had the desired effect; for the spirit of commotion, in that district, seems to be laid at rest.

Rumour, at the early part of the week, stated a number of frames to have been broken at Lowdham and Burton, in the neighbourhood of Nottingham, but upon stricter inquiry, we believe but little, if any, mischief has been done at those places. Every step which the magistrates could take, for the restoration of tranquility, has been taken; in aid of whose authority, the Bunny and Holme troops of yeomanry have again been called out: and some hosiers, for the better security of their frames, have removed many of them to places of greater safety, than that of their remaining in the workmen's hands.

On Wednesday last, a meeting was held in our shire hall, by the magistrates and many of the hosiers, on the subject of the present disturbances, which we hope will be attended with happy results. A handbill has since been published by the hosiers, and one by the town magistrates: copies of both will be found in our paper amongst the advertisements.

Last night a frame was broken in Tyler-street, in this town, which was working goods at an inferior price. We understand likewise, that several were last night broken at Basford.

We have received information, that the Berks Militia left Ipswich early on Tuesday morning, under orders to make the best of their way to this town, by forced marches.

The handbill published by the hosiers appeared in the form of the following advertisement notice.

TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM.

THE Magistrates, effectually to prevent the People of the Town from being liable to be confounded with those who may come from the Country to commit Outrages upon the Property of its Inhabitants, feel themselves under the Necessity of commanding, that ALL PUBLICANS shall shut up their Houses, and not permit or suffer any Guests to be, or remain therein, after TEN o'Clock at Night: And they do further direct all Persons within the Town, to keep within their Houses, and to enjoin upon the Individuals of their Families, their Servants, and Dependents, the keeping at Home after Ten o'Clock at Night, during the present Disposition to Tumult.

The Magistrates suppose that few Persons are ignorant, that forcibly to enter a House in the Night-Time, in order to demolish a Frame, amounts to the Crime of *Burglary*, which by Law is punishable with *Death*; but from recent Circumstances which have come to their Knowledge, they think it incumbent upon them thus publicly to declare, to all Persons employed in the Manufacture of Stockings and Lace, and entrusted with the Care of the Frames or other Property of their Employers, that in case of any such Property being destroyed in their Possession, all those Individuals who shall appear to have left their Doors open, in order to admit Persons to come therein for the avowed Purpose of destroying Frames or other Property, or who shall wilfully decline to call Assistance for preventing their Destruction, or who shall aid or assist the Persons demolishing the same in their Escape from the Civil Power, *will be deemed Accomplices with the principal Felons*, and will be proceeded against as such with the utmost Severity of the Law.

(By Order of the Magistrates),  
GEO. COLDHAM, Town Clerk.  
Nottingham, 5th December, 1811.

Although a few attacks continued in Nottingham, the resolution of the hosiers and lace manufacturers seems to have been deemed a success in the Nottingham area, although new outbreaks of violence in the surrounding counties was noted. Several committals were also recorded.

Nottingham, Friday, Dec. 13.

...

Since the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers held on the 4th inst. the excesses of the frame-breakers have been considerably more limited, and every thing has again assumed the appearance of returning tranquillity in the vicinity of this town. We have heard of only three instances of the destruction of frames since our last, viz. 6 at Bullwell, and 4 at Arnold, on Saturday night last; and at Burton Joyce, on Wednesday night. No violence whatever, we are happy to say, has been offered to the property of the Hosiers, in this town, during the last ten days.— Another meeting of the gentlemen concerned in the manufacture of Hosiery and Lace, took place this morning, at Thursland Hall, which was very numerously attended. The result of the meeting had not transpired when this paper was put to press.

We understand that two stacks (one of hay, and another of seeds), the property of Mr. Pepper, miller, were maliciously set on fire last night, in the parish of Basford.

The Royal Berkshire regiment of Militia, commanded by Lieut. Col. Ravenshaw, arrived here, on Sunday last, in waggons, from Ipswich. The march of this regiment was hastened by some unfounded intelligence received on the road relative to the riotous excesses committed in this town, and in consequence, waggons were put in requisition for the speedy conveyance of the troops, who performed a journey of 150 miles in six days. Detachments of the regiment have, since been sent out to the different villages, which have been the principal scenes of outrage, and where the most apprehension was entertained from the visits of the rioters.

The Southwell Local Militia, having been relieved from duty by the arrival of the Berkshire, returned home on Tuesday, and were dismissed.

It is understood that the Royal Horse Guards (Blue), the South Lincoln Militia, and another regiment, are under orders for this place.

It appears, that the disposition to tumult and violence, which first broke out in this neighbourhood, has extended into various parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire, where private animosity has been gratified to a great extent, by the destruction of frames, the property of various houses.

Last week a number of people assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner, at Garendon Park, near Loughborough, the paling and fences of which they pulled down and burnt, and committed other damage.—A reinforcement of hussars was sent for express to this town from Loughborough on Sunday last, who set out with all possible speed. Their presence has had the effect of intimidating the rioters, and all is again quiet.

The lovers of the fine arts will regret to hear, that among other wanton devastations committed by the rioters in Garendon Park, they broke open the ?? Temple, erected there by Ambrose Phillips, Esq. early in the last century, and destroyed the fine Statue of Venus, then brought by him, at a considerable expense, from Rome.

The Bunny Volunteer Troop of Cavalry, commanded by Capt. Boultbee, has been stationed at Sutton in Ashfield the last eight days. A correspondent observes, that no men ever conducted themselves with greater propriety, as soldiers and gentlemen, than they have done; and when their departure was announced, it was received with real regret by the major part of their inhabitants.

On Wednesday last, W.S. Parkes, and George Shaw, were committed to the gaol of this town, by Edward Swann and Wright Coldham, Gentlemen, Aldermen, to take their trials at the next Assizes, on a charge of entering by force into a dwelling-house, situate in the parish of St. Mary, in this town, on the night of the 25th day of November last, and therein feloniously breaking five stocking frames, contrary to the form of the Statute in that case made and provided.—The same day also, John Ingham was committed to the town gaol, by the above Magistrates, charged on the oaths of Rupert Renshaw, and others, with feloniously writing, or causing to be written, and sending on the 13th day of November last, a letter, signed with a fictitious name, addressed to Wm. Nunn and Co. of this town, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and to injure his person, and the person of Thomas Clarke, for not complying with certain demands, claims, and pretences of him the said John Ingham, and of certain other workmen of him the said Wm. Nunn, contrary to the form of the Statute in that case made and provided.

Committed to the county gaol, on Saturday last, by John Need, Esquire, George Paley, charged upon the oaths of Joseph Smithhurst and others, with feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously breaking and destroying, on the 13th of November last, at Sutton in Ashfield, in this county, a certain frame used in the making of framework-knitted pieces, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton in Ashfield aforesaid.

## Trouble eleswhere...

Whilst the *Nottingham Journal* of December 14th, was hopeful that matters in Nottingham were coming to some sort of resolution, the same edition also recorded a series of attacks in Derbyshire. Two visits to a certain Mr. B. Topham of Pentridge are also recorded, and his encounters with the miscreants are surely worth a story.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 December 1811

DERBY Dec. 11. It is with extreme regret we state to our readers that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in Nottinghamshire, have extended into our own county. We understand that the town of Ilkeston, and the villages of Makeney, Heage, Holbrook, Crich, &c., have suffered considerably from the visits of the Frame-Breakers, the particulars of which we have not been able to learn, but are informed, from the best authority, that frames of all descriptions have been destroyed, without discrimination. From the following account, which we have received from a correspondent, it appears that at Pentrich and the neighbourhood, their proceedings have been most destructive: soon after midnight, on the 1st instant, the Frame-Breakers, armed with weapons, arrived at Pentrich, and proceeded to the house of Mr B. Topham; knocking at the door, they demanded the key of his workshop, and a light. On opening the door, they presented three guns at him, threatening to blow his brains out if he did not comply with their demands: he told them he had no frames of the description they were in search of (for cut-up work), nor were there any in the town; and having somewhat appeased them by conciliatory language, they left his house, one of them cursing the man who had sent them thither. After going to a few more shops in the village, they departed, without doing any mischief, but threatening to return some future night and demolish those frames that were worked at an under price, or by those persons who are termed *Colts*. Accordingly, on the following evening, the neighbourhood was again visited by them, but on finding that the prices had been raised, they were satisfied without breaking any frames, excepting one at Oakenthorpe, one at South Wingfield Park, and one at Wessington. On Saturday night the seventh, about the hour of twelve, with most destructive purpose they came again to Pentrich, and literally broke into shivers ten stocking frames, and also two lace frames, notwithstanding full prices have been given. The two lace frames were worked by Mr. Topham, who, as the mob were entering his shop, chanced to be at a short distance from his house, on his return from Nottingham, and learning what was going forward, with much presence of mind ran to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells; on hearing which the rioters were alarmed and precipitately retreated. They afterwards demolished a frame a short distance from the village, and proceeded to Swanwick, where they broke three frames, and also two at Riddings, both near Alfreton. At Ilkeston, about thirty frames have been injured in the course of the week.

The most prompt and vigilant measures have been adopted by the Magistrates for the county to suppress these alarming proceedings, and restore the public tranquility, which we trust will be speedily effected.— On Monday, the Derby and Chaddesden Troops of Yeomanry Cavalry were ordered to assemble here on duty, and mustered in the evening with the greatest alacrity; and yesterday they were joined by the Radborne troop. They have been engaged in the whole of the last nights in different divisions, protecting the neighbouring villages and places where the most apprehension was entertained. The Derby and Chaddesden troops were relieved from duty this afternoon, by the arrival of a troop of Scots Greys from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here until further orders. —*Derby Mercury*.
```

As the mischief stepped up in Derbyshire, a delegation had been sent to London, perhaps in recognition that the current troubles could not be properly addressed by purely local measures.

Nottingham Review - Friday 13 December 1811

The alarm occasioned by the insurrectional conduct of the frame-breakers, had taken such deep-root in the minds of the manufacturers, that on Friday last, a deputation of them arrived in London, to lay the state of the town and county before government, in consequence whereof, a magistrate from Bow-street and several police officers, appeared in this town a few days after; but we have not heard of any additional activity being displayed on that account, as indeed that would almost seem impossible; the magistrates both of the town and county having exerted every nerve of the civil authority previous to the arrival of the watchful strangers. And we have every reason to believe, that the conciliatory measures proposed by the manufacturers, in inviting the workmen to lay their complaints before them, *after the peace of the town and the county should have been restored*, have had a greater effect in allaying the commotions than any measures adopted by the civil and military authorities could have produced. Indeed, so cautious, so determined, and so systematic in their operations were the rioters become, that the exertions both of the soldiers (whose orderly conduct and clemency have excited general admiration) and the civil power were almost unavailing.

In our own immediate vicinity, the only mischief we have heard of being done, since our last, is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. The mischief has been more extensive in Derbyshire, for, on Friday night last, seven frames were broken at Holbrook, and on Saturday night, at Pentridge and its neighbourhood, eighteen were broken; and, though we have not learnt the number, we have been informed that several were destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason which has been publicly circulated, for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that some one hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that the destructive visit may to deter him from so doing. Among the number, two lace frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own was slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of him going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.

On Sunday, the Berkshire militia arrived in this town, in twenty-four waggons, on their rout from Ipswich, and on their arrival, they neither found the town half burnt down, nor any symptoms thereof, the local militia driven away by the rioters, nor the Mayor and fifteen of the hussars murdered in the streets, as they had been informed on the road. Such an active agent is *rumour*, that if *caution* does not attend at his heels, he would soon cause a belief that half the kingdom was in flames. As a precautionary measure, the Berkshire militia are principally stationed in the neighbouring villages; and the Southwell locals have been dismissed to their respective homes, with an excellent character for their good conduct. On the last mentioned day, a report was spread here, that the flame of discord was making rapid advances at Loughborough; and a troop of hussars were summoned from hearing divine service in one of our churches, and immediately dispatched to that town; they, however, and the public, were agreeably disappointed, for Loughborough and its neighbourhood were in peace. A considerable quantity of posts and rails, belonging to a gentleman in that vicinity, had been set fire to a night or two before, but even the supposed motive for the commission of such a daring outrage, we have not been made acquainted with.

Measures of precaution for the protection of property continue to be taken both in this town and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton's hall in particular, where the arms belonging to the late Wollaton and Lenton Volunteers are deposited, has been protected by a strong guard for seventeen successive nights, for fear those arms should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal for assistance from our barracks, in case of an alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself: the workmen in thee various branches of the framework-knitting trade, are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter, we are happy to hear, lend a favorable ear to such solicitations, and we understand are this day holding a meeting at the Exchange-Hall, to take the business into consideration; and the magistrates laudably interest themselves in furthering the work of conciliation.

After flattering ourselves with these favorable. appearances, it is doubly painful to have to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw, and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, Flour-seller, in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part was saved.

We are credibly informed, that yesterday afternoon, a frame was broken at Burton, in this county. The depredators escaped detection, though there are parties both of horse and foot soldiers in the village.

At the moment our paper was going to press, a meeting of an extraordinary nature was sitting at the Shire Hall, as we understand, for the purpose of taking into consideration the alarming state of the county, of hearing complaints, and examining into means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority. There were present, His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the County), Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &c. and the Magistracy of the County.

Committed on Wednesday the 11th instant, for trial at the Assizes, by Edward Swann and Wright Coldham, Gentlemen, Aldermen, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, Lace-manufacturer, upon the oaths of Rupert Renshaw and others, with feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed with a ficticious name, viz. "*Ned Lud and Co.*" and directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. Park-street, Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and injure his person, and the person of Thomas Clarke, a person concerned in such manufacture.

And on the same day, by the same Magistrates, William Parkes, and George Shaw, upon the oath of Joseph Allen and others, with entering a dwelling house in this town, on the 25th of November, and breaking five stocking frames contrary to Statute.

In addition to the military force now stationed here, we understand that two troops of the Oxford Blues, commanded by Captain Fenwick, are on their march from Reading to this town, by forced marches.

Communications were also starting to appear in the national (which is to say, London) press with letters from correspondents passing on the news previously reported in the regional papers.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

We have received letters and papers from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester, our extracts from which shew, that the disturbances which first broke out in the county of Nottingham, are extending with alarming rapidity to the neighbouring counties. Nottingham, where we were led to believe that all disputes between the manufacturers and their employers were in a train of accommodation, the turbulent spirit of the rioters, encouraged long impunity, is manifested in the acts of incendiaries; in the county of Derby, the number of frames broken within the last eight days exceed 110; and in Leicester, we fear, we shall soon have to record similar acts of violence. Government, we understand, wished in the instance to leave the suppression'of these disturbances to the magistracy, who, with the military, have, throughout, been alike active and indefatigable; but it must be evident that the rioters are too well organised, act too systematically, and receive too correct information, to be suppressed without other aids.

LEICESTER, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. Rumours are in circulation here, that a party of frame-breakers have visited one or two villages in our vicinity: but the extent of the damage, or whether any, is not known. Our yeomanry have been on duty for some days past. The King's Guards (Blues) arrived yesterday morning; and the Cumberland Militia have been ordered thither from Cambridge.

DERBY, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. It is with extreme regret we state, that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in a neighbouring county, have broken out here with destructive violence: At Holbrook, Crich, Heage, and Pentridge, not fewer than between 40 and 50 frames, of all descriptions, have been broken since Saturday last. A party of these deluded men visited Pentridge thrice in one night (the 1st inst.) not finding the frames they were in search of at Mr. Topham's, they departed without doing any mischief, but giving caution to the people not work at an under price, nor encourage colts among them, threatening otherwise they would return and demolish their frames. On the second visit they were pacified at finding that the prices had been raised, and contented themselves with demolishing three frames at Oakerthorpe, &c. On Saturday night they returned and broke twelve frames, notwithstanding full prices having been given. Two of the lace frames belonged to Mr. Topham, who, not being at home on their arrival, but learning what was going forward, ran with great presence of mind to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells; hearing which the rioters were alarmed, and precipitateiy retired. They afterwards demolished several frames at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley. At Ilkeston about 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week. The reason which has been circulated for the frame breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that one hosier had hitimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames to the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Measures have been adopted to prevent arms falling into the hands of the rioters, and the Derby and Chadderton yeomanry cavalry have been called out. A troop of Scots Greys has also arrived from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here. The military are authorised to act in case of falling in with the rioters.

NOTTINGHAM, FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DEC. 13. We had flattered ourselves that the publication of the Resolution agreed to at a Meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers would have caused the frame-breakera to suspend their destructive proceedings throughout the county; but though no act of violence has occurred in this town for the last ten days, they have not ceased elsewhere. At Bulwell and Arnold ten frames wore broken on Saturday Sunday, and two at Baston Joyce on Wednesday night.

Three o'clock. —After flattering ourselves with the hopes of approaching tranquillity, it is doubly painful to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, flour-seller in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latter only a small part was saved.—At this moment an extraordinary meeting is sitting at the Shire Hall, consisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the county) Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warres, Sir T. W. White, and the Magistrates, to take into consideration the alarming and destructive state of the county, to receive informations, and to endeavour to ascertain the means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

The latest accounts received from Nottingham state, that in the immediate vicinity, the only mischief recently done is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. It has been more extensive in Derbyshire; for on Saturday se'nnight, near Pentridge, 18 frames were broken and several destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason publicly circulated for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge is, that some hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that their visit was to deter him. Two lace-frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of his going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.

Precautions for the protection of property continue both at Nottingham and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton's Hall, where arms are deposited has been guarded for 17 successive nights, lest they should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal, in case of alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself; the Workmen in the frame-work knitting-trade are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter lend a favourable ear to such solicitations, and we understand on Friday held a meeting at the Exchange-hall, on the subject.—After such favourable appearances, it is painful to record new aggressions . Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, were on Friday night set fire to at Basford, the gormer entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part saved.

We are informed, that on Thursday a frame was broken at Burton. The depredators escaped detection, though horse and foot soldiers were in the village.

An extraordinary meeting sat at the Shire Hall on Friday, to consider the state of the country, to hear complaints, and to examine into the means by which the rioters support themselves. There were present the Duke of Newcastle, Viscount Newark, Sir J. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &c., and the Magistracy of the county.

Wednesday, the 11th inst. was committed for trial at the Assizes, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, lace manufacturer, for feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed "Ned Lud and Co." directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. threatening break and destroy their frames, and injure his person and that of T. Clarke, concerned in such manufacture. The appearance of the rioters was feared at Leicester.

To the north as well, Edward Baines, of the *Leeds Mercury*, was maintaining a watching brief on the affairs to the south, and trying to place the events into some sort of historical context.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 December 1811

Nottingham, Dec. 12- The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has no parallel in history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. Day after day have the Magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil powers, and called in additional aid of the military; but hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail; a mysterious organization has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. — The rioters appear suddenly, in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of who, being whomsoever he may, is stiled *General Ludd*, and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of the Monarch. Indeed it is well understood, that disobedience to his commands is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organized band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already being inflicted, by the burning of haystacks, &c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and so few of the depredators apprehended.

The following article, on the same subject, is from the *Statesman* Newspaper, and is of so alarming a complexion as to induce a hope that there is some degree of exaggeration:—

*December 15*— There are 20,000 stocking-makers out of employment. Six regiments of soldiers from different parts of the country have been sent into this town; and 300 new constables have been sworn in to keep the peace. But all this is of no avail as the practice of setting fire to corn and hay stacks, and breaking open houses still continues. Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken, which cost £140 each; from twenty to thirty of them are destroyed in a night. The whole country, for twenty miles around, is full of these ruinous proceedings, nor can they be checked, Nottingham gaol is full of debtors; and the country is equally distressed. no trade; no money. This has been the case for two months. This town is now a garrison, and strictly under martial law. God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin. 

Later accounts down to the 18th inst. state that no advantage has resulted from the expected Meeting of the manufacturers, but that the parties broke up without coming to any decision.

Finally, with Christmas approaching, it seems as if the Magistrates and their military support were starting to make some headway in making arrests.

Stamford Mercury - Friday 20 December 1811

THE RlOTS.— Notwithstanding the extreme vigilance of the civil and military powers in Nottingham and its neighbourhood, depredations (though we are happy to say in a lesser degree) still continue to be committed.— The utmost measures of precaution, security, and conciliation are taken, and we anxiously look forward to a speedy adjustment of the existing misunderstanding.

On Saturday night a man was escorted to Leicester goal (*sic*) by a party of light horse, for breaking a stocking frame in the neighbourhood of Loughborough; — since that time no fresh outrages have been committed in Leicestershire.

Committals to Nottingham town gaol:— W. S. Parkes, and George Shaw, to take their trials at the next assizes, on a charge of entering by force into a dwelling-house, situate in the parish of St. Mary, Nottingham, on the night of the 25th day of November last, and therein feloniously breaking five stocking-frames; —also John Ingham, charged on the oaths of Rupert Renshaw, and others, with feloniously writing, or causing to be written, and sending, on the 13th day of November last, a letter, signed with a fictitious name, addressed to Nunn and Co. of Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and to injure his person, and the person of Thos. Clarke, for not complying with certain demands, claims, and pretences of him the said John Ingham, and of certain other workmen of him the said Nunn.— Committed the county gaol:— George Paley, charged upon the oaths of Joseph Smithhurst, and others, with feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously breaking and destroying, on the 19th of November last, at Sutton in Ashfield, a certain frame used in the making of frame-work-knitted pieces, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton in Ashfield aforesaid.

```

And in a further attempt to guarantee the peace, a Royal Proclamation of December 18th, 1811, the Prince Regent set up a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, offered a reward of £50 pound per person convicted, for information leading to their arrest of anyone involved in the outrages, plus a pardon if the informer had been engaged in those activities themselves.

BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES,  
Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in the Name and on the Behalf of HIS MAJESTY.

A PROCLAMATION.

WHEREAS it has been represented that a considerable Number of disorderly Persons, chiefly composed of Stockingers, or Persons employed in the Stocking Manufactories, have for some Time past assembled themselves together in a riotous and tumultuous Manner, in the Town and County of the Town of Nottingham, and likewise in several Parts of the Counties of Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester; and, for the Purpose of compelling their Employers to comply with certain Regulations prescribed by themselves, with respect to Work, and the Wages to be paid for the same, have had Recourse to Measures of Force and Violence, and have actually committed various Acts of Outrage in different Parts of the Counties abovementioned, whereby the Property of many of His Majesty's good Subjects has, in several Instances, been wholly destroyed, and their Lives and Properties are still greatly endangered: We, therefore, acting in the Name and on behalf of His Majesty, being duly sensible of the mischievous Consequences which must inevitably ensue, as well to the Peace of the Kingdom as to the Lives and Properties of His Majesty's Subjects, from such wicked and illegal Practices if they go unpunished, and being firmly resolved to cause the Laws to be put in Execution for the Punishment of such Offenders, have thought fit, by the Advice of the Privy Council, to issue this Proclamation, hereby strictly commanding all Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, and all other Civil Officers whatsoever, within the said Town and County of the Town of Nottingham, and the said Counties of Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester respectively, that they do use their utmost Endeavours to discover, apprehend, and bring to Justice the Persons concerned in the Riotous Proceedings above mentioned: And as a further Inducement to discover the said Offenders, We do hereby, acting as aforesaid, promise and declare, that any Person or Persons who shall discover and apprehend, or cause to be discovered and apprehended, the Authors, Abettors, or Perpetrators of any of the Outrages above-mentioned, so that they, or any of them, may be duly convicted thereof, shall be entitled to the Sum of FIFTY POUNDS for each and every Person who shall be so convicted, and shall also receive His Majesty's most Gracious Pardon for the said Offence, in case the Person making such Discovery as aforesaid shall be liable to be prosecuted for the same: And the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury are hereby required to make Payments accordingly of the said Reward.

Perhaps taking inspiration from the apparent ease with which the frame breakers were apparently getting with their attacks, at least for the most part, it seems as if others saw an opportunity for more nefarious, personal gain.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 28 December 1811

It is with great concern we have to communicate the intelligence, that the 'deluded men,' who, under the title of *"Ned Lud's men,"* carried on for the last nine months, their depredations on the property of the persons employed in the manufactory of this part of the country, have in the county of Derby commenced their attacks on a different description of persons, as well as a different species of property; though it is nothing more than could be expected, when the desperate men, such as the above must be, have been enabled for so great a length of time to exist in a state of warfare against property, and in the very centre of the kingdom; for if these men are to carry their point, he must be a very short-sighted man indeed who cannot foresee, that they will not confine themselves to the attack of any one sort of property. — A few nights since a farm house was broken into at Stanley, in the county of Derby, by armed men, and stripped of the money and all the linen they could carry away; and on Saturday night last the farm house at Locko Grange, in the same neighbourhood, was entered by two men, armed with pistols. The family were all gone to bed, except the farmer's son. One of the miscreants presented a pistol at his head, which he snatched from him; and the other directly pointed his pistol at him, but it fortunately only snapped. The family were alarmed at the noise, and one of them coming down, the villains made off, and unfortunately escaped. The young man who made so resolute a resistance, is, we understand, much hurt in the scuffle he had with the ruffians.—But the most daring attack that we have heard of, took place in the neighbourhood of Hopwell and Ockbrook, in the same part of the country, not far from Hopwell Hall; a farm house, occupied by a ?? a farmer and miller, was attacked on Monday morning, about three o'clock, by 11 or 12 men, armed with pistols and bludgeons, who at first said, they only wanted the man to sign a paper respecting the price of corn, as their families were starving; he would not open his door to them, which, however, they immediately forced open themselves with great violence. The farmer defended the stair-case with his gun as long as he could, his wife giving the alarm at the window; but a large stone thrown at her by one of the ruffians, which cut her lip asunder, soon made her desist. The farmer being overpowered, they took away his gun, and he with difficulty prevailed upon them to spare his life. They swore their families should not starve, whilst money was to be had, and immediately rifled the house, taking away £37. in money. They called themselves "Lud's men," and said *"that was only a beginning!"*

We cannot but indulge a hope that these accounts may be somewhat exaggerated, which may be easily accounted for, from the state of alarm many parts of the country labour under; but we have heard them from so respectable a quarter, that we think it a duty to communicate them to the public, that persons whose lives or property are in danger, may have the opportunity of taking the necessary precautions for their own safety.

Several frames have been broken since our last, notwithstanding the issuing of his Majesty's Proclamation, and in open defiance of the measures adopted by the Corporate Body and the Magistracy, viz. 2 in North Stree, in this town, and 6 in the parishes of Radford and Arnold.

In a letter from Christmas Day, 1811, to Sir Joseph Banks, naturalist to Captain Cook's first voyage to the South Pacific on the *Endeavour*, and one time president of the Royal Society, and landowner near Pentrich, describes some level of organisation in collecting monies to support those who had lost their work by virtue of having their frames broken, as well as offering "protection" for frames that were not being operated in ways deemed offensive by the frame breakers.

A vivid account of the frame-breakers' systematic methods in outlying districts is given in a letter of December 25, 1811, to Sir Joshua `sic` Banks from his steward, `[H.O., 42. 118]` describing what took place at Pentridge in Derby: '... on Thursday two men came to this place who called themselves inspectors from the Committee, they went to every stockinger's house, and discharged them from working under such prices as they gave them a list of, and said they should come again in a few days, and in case any of them were found working without having a ticket from their Master saying that he was willing to give the prices stated in their list — They should break there frames. They summononed all the Stockingers about twelve or fourteen in number of Master Men to a Publick House, with as much consequence as if they had had a mandate from the Prince Regent. When they got them thither all I can learn at present, was for the purpose of collecting Money from them for the support of those families, who where deprived of getting their bread by having their frames broken. — Where they found a frame worked by a person who had not served a regular apprenticeship, or by a Woman, they discharged them from working, and if they promised to do so, they stuck a paper upon the frame with these words written upon it: "Let this frame stand, the colts removed." — Colt is the name given to all those who have not served a regular apprenticeship.'

> How far the existing men's organisations took part in framebreaking or gave it their countenance it is difficult to determine. There was clearly some organisation formed to support the persons deprived of work by the destruction of their machines. ...

Sir Joseph Banks has an estate in the area, and apparently lands substantial enough to merit a gamekeeper, as we see from this brief report in the *Nottingham Review* of [Friday 21 February 1817](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18170221/014/0003):

> A gamekeeper of Sir Joseph Banks was shot by a poacher about a fortnight ago. John North, a farmer in the neighbourhood, who was suspected, has been taken up, and the gun left in the wood, at the time of wounding the gamekeepeer, is identified by four witnesses as having belonged to him. Three witnesses also recognised the hat left on the ground at the same time. The Prisoner is fully committed to Lincoln jail.
```

We also hear of an attack on the evening of December 25th, 1811, at South Wingfield, where a certain *Mr. Topham* received a visit from men asking to inspect his frames, then robbing him. *It is not clear whether this is __Benjamin__ Topham, whose address typically seems to be given as Pentridge, or another Mr. Topham. Certainly, it seems that the Mr. Topham referred to below is also a guardian of the poor.*

Statesman (London) - Monday 06 January 1812

Nottingham, Jan 3.— The alarm excited in Derbyshire, by the numerous burglaries and ' other outrages committed there within the last fourteen or twenty days, has not subsided, and the utmost activity prevails among those whose property is considered in any danger, as well as among the Civil and Military Authorities in general. Whether the depredators consist of that body of men, which has laidy been concerted in frame-breaking, or of other desperadoes, who have taken advantage of the confusion into which this part of the country has been hurled, by the practices of the former, remains at present unascertained; in either case, however, our surprise is less excited at the depredations, than our indignation at the depredators; for crime advances by as regular a progress, as does the noxious weed in the garden, Vitt is not timely eradicated. — In addition to the burglaries committed in Derbyshire, as named in our last, we have to record one of serious nature, which was perpetrated in the house of Mr. Topham, in South Wingfield Park, on the 25th of December, at night. The robbers entered in disguise, and demanded to examine Mr. Topham's frames; and when they had gained adnaittance, under that pretence, likewise demanded his cash,which they took away to the amount of about 62*l.* as also the parish books, he being overseer of the poor. In our own neighbourhood, it is with much pleasure we have to state, that the outrages weekly diminish in number, though not in magnitude. On Friday evening a valuable plain silk frame was broken in a house near the Meadow Platts, in this town, belonging to an eminent hosier, which stood between two others of a like description, the property of another gentleman, and they remained untouched. The windows of Mr. Trentham, an eminent manufacturer, in this town, have been twice assailed within these few days by brickbats and stones; and the depredators have not yet been discovered, though a handsome reward been offered.

On the same night, there were also violent attacks elsewhere.

Northampton Mercury - Saturday 28 December 1811

Derby, December 25.—We last week congratulated our readers on the re-appearance of tranquillity among the frame-work-knitters, and we have not heard that it has since suffered any interruption; but we lament to state, that since our last, the neighbourhood has been alarmed by events of a still more violent and atrocious nature.—On Sunday evening, about eight o'clock, the house of Mr. Brentnall, of Locko Grange, near this place, was violently attacked by a band of villains consisting of eight or more persons; two of them with their faces blacked, and armed with pistols, entered the house.—Mr. Brentnall and part of his family were retired to rest, but being alarmed by the noise, he hastened down stairs and found his son engaged in opposing the ruffians. By their united exertions, and with the assistance of a servant maid, whose bravery on this occasion we understand, merits much praise, they succeeded in repulsing the depredators, who soon afterwards retired without accomplishing their purpose.—From thence is supposed the same gang, but considerably increased in numbers, proceeded to Ockbrook, where about three o'clock next morning they attacked and broke into the house of Mr. Hunt, Mill, which they robbed of 35 one pound, and one guinea notes, a quantity of copper coin, and some other articles.

At a meeting of the hosiers held yesterday se'nnight, at Nottingham, it was agreed, that an alteration should be made in the printed list of prices, published in March last, approximating more nearly to the general wishes of the workmen, and which, it was resolved, should be abided by and published. As every symptom of violence had ceased on Monday last, it is to be hoped that the distrubances have terminated.
