# The Nottinghamshire Outbreaks Continue

In the first quarter of 1812, frame breaking was to continue in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, although I will not be including reports of most of those events here. My intention in this section is more to describe those actions that impacted on Mr. Benjamin Topham.

It is, however, perhaps worth noting that reports of the actions in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire continued to appear in the *Leeds Mercury*. Who knows to what extent these reports might have helped motivate or inspire the men who would lead the machine breaking activities in West Yorkshire, and particularly in Huddersfield, in that first quarter of 1812?

RIOTS IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE. *(From the Review of Friday last.)* In recording the depredations of the frame-breakers, we have been led to hope each succeeding week would terminate these ever to be lamented transactions. In this, however, we have been mistaken; for each succeeding week has hitherto been accompanied by succeeding crimes, and our present records present a scene not less lamentable than the one given in our last; and prove that neither the vigilance of police officers, the terror of the military, nor even the impending penalties of the law, are sufficient to suppress this spirit of revolt. It is with pleasure we state that one reputable house in this town (Wm. Nunn and Co.) have publicly announced that they have taken off all the frame rent, and are giving the full prices. This conduct, if followed by other manufacturers, will, we trust, soon restore peace and harmony in the town and neighbourhood.

On Saturday night one frame was broken in this town; and the following evening four were destroyed at New Radford, one of which was supposed to be the completest silk frame in existence; and, we understand, was then employed in making an order of stockings for the Prince Regent. On this case we are desired by the holder of these frames to state that he had worked in the finest of these frames for twenty years; during which time he has continued to receive the same price, and marked the stockings with the proper marks. On the same night two or three frames were broken at Ruddington, nine of the warp lace kind at Limby, all of great value, and all employed in making the two-course-hole net. At the last mentioned place the people had an expectation that a visit would be paid them, and a number had agreed to watch for the approach of their nocturnal visitors, which they did till midnight, at which time, imagining all the danger was over, they dispersed, and went to their respective homes. This was no sooner done, than the framebreakers made their appearance: fourteen of them entered the house of Mr. Shipley, and in ten minutes completed their work. The damage is estimated at 200*l.* and upwards. On the same night, seven plain cotton frames at Cotmanhay, in the parish of Ilkiston; and, if our information be correct, eleven of the latter description were destroyed at Swanwick: the two latter towns are in Derbyshire.

At ten o'clock this morning we received the disagreeable intelligence, that 22 frames were last night broken at Lenton. About 50 men entered the village, armed in various ways; and while the mischief was going on, every pass in the village was guarded. One man, who was passing with a loaf of bread, was stopped by them, and compelled to stand sentry himself, with a bar of iron in his hand, with an order to give the alarm if any one approached, or otherwise to have his brains blown out. The man who ran to Nottingham to inform the soldiers, had a narrow escape; one of the frame-breakers running after him, vociferating the most horrid vengeance if he caught him. The man escaped, and so did the depredators. The names of the persons at whose houses the frames are broken, with the number at each house, are as follows:- Five at G. Ball's, four of which, he has informed us, were his own property, and were working at full price; eight at Thos. Selby's; one at Wm. Selby's, and pulled the jack-wires out of another two at Jos Shepherd's; one at ——— Taylor's; one at John Barnes's; one at Ann Taylor's; and two at Wm. Burton's. After they had done, they fired three pistols. What adds to the audacity of this affair is, that Lenton, is only about a quarter of a mile from the barracks, and one from Nottingham.

As well as editorial comment, the *Nottingham Journal* also provided a platform for correspondents seeking to explain the causes of the troubles, call the manufacturers to come together to find a solution, and have the mischief makers put to justice.

TO THE PUBLIC.

As there is reason to apprehend, that the calm which we have for a few days enjoyed in this great manufacturing district, is rather a suspension than an entire cessation of outrages; that the perverse mind still exists, though somewhat restrained by power; I venture to express my sentiments, on a subject so interesting to our peace and happiness.

The extensive hostilities in which this country is engaged; and the exclusion of our manufactures from a great part of the Continent of Europe, have so much reduced the consumption of them, as to have occasioned unusual competition in the sale, and a consequent reduction in the price of our articles of commerce. The merchant is induced to endeavour to indemnify himself by manufacturing the goods at a cheaper rate. If the payment to the Manufacturer were not more than a sufficient compensation for his labour before such reduction, he will suffer and complain; and may redress the grievances which he may experience in any peaceable and legal manner. The Hosiery and Lace Manufactures, which have been so extensively established in this and the neighbouring counties, have partaken in the general depression of trade; and the oppression of some, and the daring and felonious conduct of others, have increased the distress, and surrounded us with danger and alarm. It may be well to retrace our steps, to examine what has been done amiss, and to search for a remedy, as calm and impartial spectators, influenced only by a regard to what is fair, honourable, and good.

The Masters dismissed some of their workmen, and they were justified by necessity: some reduced their prices; the act was legal: but it was peculiarly cruel and unkind, at a period when the necessaries of life required an increased expenditure; it was also unavailing, because it was not the objection of price, but the want of demand, which had injured the trade; others took away the rack, an instrument by which the quantity of certain work might be ascertained; it may be presumed, that they required more than was due, as they removed the standard of their just claim. What was necessary, can only be lamented; what was cruel, mut be censured; and what was unjust, must be condemned.

Many of the Manufacturers found out other employments, receiving also reasonable assistance from their parishes, and quietly acquiesced in the deprivation of many of many of their usual comforts: they are to be pitied, and will have their reward in their own approving consciences, and in the season of Final Retribution. Others have required their Masters to manufacture articles, for which they had no demand; have issued threatening letters; have associated in large bodies, and, armed and disguised, have broken into houses, have destroyed stocking and lace frames, filled the country with terror, and, by their felonious conduct, forfeited their lives to the offended laws. They have increased the general misery, by depriving many of their means of employment; and have injured the common labourer by creating for him new competitors. They will probably drive away the trade to remote parts of the kingdom, where men, of better principles and conduct, know and practice their duty to society.

Amidst all this confusion, the Master Manufacturers have been either timid or supine; they have not, as is usual on similar occasions, entered into any subscription; nor in general taken any active measures for preserving their property, or bringing to justice those who injured it.

It appears, then, that the duty of the different orders of society is,— for those employed as Manufacturers to lay aside their unreasonable desire for that work which is not wanted; to deplore the mischief which they have done; and to come to commit outrages and felonies, which defy all decency, law, and religion, place the country in a state of terror; lead to a habit of committing the most atrocious crimes, and must be punished with the heaviest visitation of Justice.

The Master Manufacturers ought not to make unreasonable abatements of wages; the poor and industrious are deserving of their compassion; they are not to be treated with harshness, and cruelty; and all injustice to them must have the indignation of the good, and the anger of heaven.

All, whether rich or poor, are deeply interested in restoring and maintaining the public tranquility. The mischief, if not speedily suppressed, will not confine itself to its present form, but will endanger the lives and property of all. Great numbers have been already deprived of their ordinary means of subsistence by the pretended friends, but truly the bitterest enemies of the lower order of society. It is, therefore, the duty and the interest of all to assist the Civil Power in detecting and apprehending offenders; to support the Magistrates in their exertions to restore tranquillity; to fear no danger in the cause of law and justice, and peace; but boldly to resist such outrages as have a tendency to produce insurrection, anarchy, and the worst of tyranny.

## More of Benjamin Topham's frames are broken

With the Frame Breaking Bill set to pass through Parliament and make frame breaking a capital offence, it seems that impending threat was not yet enough to quell the activities of the frame breakers themselves.

We understand, that not withstanding the pending severities of the law upon the frame-breakers, ten frames were broken and totally demolished, at Pentrich, on Saturday night last; and on Tuesday night last, the iron work of one narrow stocking frame was stolen and completely carried off from a house, situated on the Parson's Flat, at Basford, near this town.
```

They were also nothing if not persistent. For once again, we see them attacking the frames of Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentridge.

The report in the *Leeds Mercury*, which seems to have a been a widely syndicated item, appears to suggest that Topham may have been pressing for those involved in frame breaking to be brought to justice, or perhaps he had been involved in a Jury sitting against them? Whatever the case, it seems that his frames were being targeted again.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14 March 1812

The depredations of the Machine-breakers, in the West-Riding of this county, we are sorry to find are still continued. The following is a copy of a letter from our Correspondent at Huddersfield, dated March 12:—

"In the last week, (I think on Thursday night) four houses, near Slaithwaite, were entered by the Luddites, and the frames, shears, &c. destroyed. The name of the owners I have not learned; *indeed, there appears a shyness in speaking on the subject*. Threatening letters have been sent, of which you will soon learn the particulars.

"Last night, the houses of Mr. John Garner, of Honley; Mr. Clement Dyson, Dungeon, and Mr. Roberts, Crosland; were visit by the malcontents, and the obnoxious machinery destroyed. More troops are at this moment entering the town."

"Nottingham, March 9."— Such is the apparent disposition, and systematic conduct of the frame breakers that, if a frame is once marked out for and destruction, its state may be said to be settled, except some step be taken by its possessor to remove the cause assigned for its condemnation; at least such are the conclusions we have a right to draw from what we daily see and hear. It has long formed a topic of conversation, that Mr. B. Topham, of Pentridge, in Derbyshire, had excited the hatred of the *Luddites*, by his activity in attempting to bring some of them to justice, in consequence of several frames being broken in his shop some time ago; and, on Saturday night last, his property became an object of their vengeance; for a party of men entered his dwelling and demolished seven pointnet lace, and three plain hose frames. I am likewise informed, that a man and his wife, who are the chief evidence against a person of the name of *Elliot*, now confined in Derby Gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, likewise felt the effects of their fury; and only escaped with their lives on condition of promising not to swear against the man."
```

In the *London Chronicle*, we learn a few more details of the attack on Topham's frames, and again the implication it was personally motivated, for the work on the machines, as well as the fabric of his house, were damaged, as well as the frames.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS. The Nottingham Papers state, that the Commission of Assize had been opened in the Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bayley, after complimenting the Magistrates on the smallness of the Calendar, observed, that in the two cases of frame-breaking, "that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital." No outrage had been committed by the frame-breakers within the last few days. The ten frames broken yesterday se'nnight, at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, belonging to Mr. Topham, were in full work. The violence appears to have been owing to personal spleen, as the silk and lace pieces about the frames were much injured, his doors and windows all broken to pieces, and his own life menaced, while the violence was committing, by a number of armed men without. Mr. Topham for a short time concealed himself in a closet.

```

Another argument in favour of personal malice being involved in the attack comes from the claim that the frames were being worked "at full price". The following report, which also appeared in several other London papers, recaps on Topham's previous encounters with the Luddites.

Nottingham  
March 13

The Commission of Assize has just been opened in our Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect:— His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the Calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter.

On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame-breaking only, *and no other damage had been done*, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the Prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the Prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.

It has been asserted in the House of Commons by Mr. Wynne, and supported by Mr. John Smith, that the Frame-breaking Bill has already had a bad effect, by partly closing up the channels of private Information against the perpetrators. If this is really the case, what good, we would ask, is to be expected from its influence? for its terrors have not had the effect of stopping the breaking of frames. If, however, these observations should fall into the hands of the misguided men alluded to, we most earnestly hope that they will take a timely hint, and cease from their destructive and dangerous practices. For, independent of the disquietude such conduct must give to every man's mind, who is concerned in it, on account of the danger of detection, most assured we are that its further prosecution will be attended with the most fatal consequences to the future prosperity of this town and neighbourhood. May our solicitations in this respect not be made is vain!

On Saturday night, seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of Benjamin Topham, of that place; and, what makes the case peculiarly distressing is, the lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*l.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the framebreakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of this town, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven them away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having noticed, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces, about the frames, received considerable injury. What frames were at work, were employed on double press net, and at the full price; therefore, the fair conclusion is, that the violence had its origin in personal spleen; which, according to his own declaration, as far as his knowledge goes, has been raised against him without any cause whatsoever. The same night two frames were broken at Losco, about four miles on this side Pentridge; and on Tuesday night, one was carried clean away from Basford.

DERBYSHIRE RIOTS.— On Saturday night the 7th inst. seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of B.

On the same night, a man and his wife, at Swanwick, who are expected to be the principle evidences against two persons confined in Derby gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, were visited, as it is supposed, by the same party, who assailed their dwelling broke their furniture to pieces, and in some degree injured their persons. They have been removed to Derby as a place of safety. The same night two frames were broken at Losca; and on Tuesday night one was carried away from Basford.

## Nottingham Assizes, March 1812

At the March Assizes in Nottingham, the presiding judge noted two frame breaking cases on to the list, including one that took place at Old Basford on January 3rd, 1812. Also up for trial were two defendants charged with the burglaries at Lockbrook Mill and Ocko Grange, on December 21st, which may have appeared to take a similar form to the Ludding attacks, at least at first, but quickly transpired to be more directly criminal enterprises.

Notwithstanding the nature of the many attacks that had taken place over the preceding three months, at the Nottingham Assizes of March 1812, those charged with framebreaking offences appear to have got off relatively lightly:

Star (London) - Saturday 28 March 1812

RIOTERS. NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 18.

*William Barnes*, one of the most respectable men in Basford, was arraigned on suspicion of conniving at the breaking of three frames in his workshop, on the 26th of January, 1812, belonging to Messrs. Haddens, hosiers, in this town.

Mr. Bodill, constable, stated, that he took an order from Mr. Hadden to the prisoner, on the day named in the indictment, directing him to deliver up to such Constable the three frames belonging to Messrs. Haddens the next day; but it was thought necessary to plant two of the Berkshire Militia in the house, to protect them during the night from the violence of the Luddites. Accordingly, the witness took two soldiers with him to the house, and when he gave the prisoner the order, he said, "GOD ALMIGHTY d——n the Hosiers, they are a pack of damned scoundrels altogether;" wished the soldiers to be taken away, and would not suffer any of his family to fetch them any refreshment.

Henry Huggins, a soldier, deposed that he was placed in the prisoner's house, for the purpose above specified; that the prisoner went out in fifteen minutes, after the admittance of himself and comrade, to fetch his daughter, for fear she should be frightened when the came at the sight of soldiers in the house. on whose account he seemed very uneasy. He described the prisoner as going out and in several times; and at length he entered in silence with eighteen or twenty persons at his back, in disguise, who immediately secured the soldiers and their arms—threatened them with instant death if they made any resistance, and sent the prisoner up stairs while they demolished the frames belonging to Messrs. Haddens. The soldier described one person as a gentleman, who seemed to have the command of the rest, and who said to the men, "Ned, do your duty, or you shall not be paid." Witness further stated, that the frame-breakers remained in the house eighteen or twenty minutes; and that when they went away, the prisoner came down stairs, and exclaimed, "Oh, dear me! this will be laid upon me! these frames would not have been broken, if the Constable had not come here." Witness went on to state, that the prisoner stated himself, during their conversation, to have been forced into his own house by two men, each with a pistol at his head, threatening, in a low tone of voice, instant death if he created the least alarm; that a table was broken in the house, and three frames in the shop, while three remained unbroken; and asserted most distinctly, that he did not fall asleep before the frame-breakers entered the house.

Thomas Osborne, the other soldier, who had been present during the last witness's examination, confirmed, in a hesitating manner, what his comrade had stated; admitted how much he was alarmed while the frame-breakers held their pistols to his breast; that he had not slept before they entered the house; and that they gave him and his comrade their arms back when they had completed their work of spoilation.

After Mr. Alexander Hadden had proved the demolished frames to belong to the firm of Alexander, John, and George Hadden, and that he had sent an order to the prisoner to deliver up the said frames, as stated by the witness Bodill, Barnes was called upon for his defence, when he declared his innocence in the most solemn manner; that, so far from his having acted in the outrageous manner as stated by the witness Bodill, that he had not sworn an oath during the last seven years; that he thought it hard work for Mr. Hadden to send for his frames at so short a notice, as it was not only contrary to established custom, but that he had worked for him ten years, without ever an angry word having passed between them. He further stated, that if the soldiers had not slept before the entrance of the frame-breakers, that they had done something very much like it, for that he saw them hanging down their heads, and heard them snore; and that when he awoke them, they exclaimed bitterly against the Hosiers, for being the cause of having such hard duty imposed upon them, and that it would be better to use violence to their persons than their frames.

Mr. Hadden voluntarily rose up and confirmed the testimony of Barnes respecting the length of time he had worked for him, and the purity of his character; after which,

Robert Elliott, a neighbour of the prisoner's, deposed, that he was in conversation with him at half-past six in the evening the frames were broken, and that he had not parted with him at his (the prisoner's) own door many minutes before he saw the framebreakers enter his house, and heard the hammers go in the shop. Several highly respectable persons were ready to speak to the character of the prisoner, but the Judge thought their testimonies unnecessary; and after an impartial address to the Jury, they returned a verdict of *Not Guilty*.

Thursday morning, notwithstanding the Court was opened at 6 o'clock, yet it was crowded to excess, by persons of every rank in the town, desirous of hearing the trial of John Ingham, who, at the suit of the Crown, had been removed from the town gaol by a writ of Habeas Corpus. Mr. Selby bring sworn, he stated himself to be foreman to the house of William Nunn and Co. in Nottingham, who he said were proprietors of a silk lace manufacture, and a cotton lace manufacture; that the prisoner had served under him in the capacity of a general warehouseman; that he had frequently seen him write invoices, orders, and general book accounts; but did not remember to have seen him write more than one letter, and that was fifteen or sixteen months ago. On being shewn two letters, subscribed "Ned Ludd and Co." from New Radford, and directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. Park-street, Nottingham, the one being dated the 20th and the other the 30th of November, 1811, and brought from Nottingham post-office, by Gilling, the general servant of the house; he stated it as his belief, that they were written by the prisoner at the bar, to whom he gave an excellent character but would not take upon himself to swear positively that they were his hand-writing, because they appeared to be written in a disguised hand. On being asked why he believed them to be written by the prisoner, he answered, from the general conformation of the characters, and from the general expression of the letter. He stated that he was about three months in the same warehouse with Ingham.

The letters were then read by the Clerk of the Court, but from his extreme bad expression, it was impossible to collect any thing from him, except their general import, which was, that Mr. Nunn had long been in the habit of imposing upon his workmen, by demanding his lace pieces to be made longer than the rest of the lace manufacturers; that though he had been put to the rack, which regulated the length of the pieces, yet that was was not a sufficient atonement for past offences. Nor would Ned Ludd and Co. be contented, except he published a clear statement of his intentions to the world; that without this was done, fifty of his frames should be destroyed, his premises should be burnt, himself, and Clark, (his taker-in) who was accused of being the principal instigator and instrument of his oppressions, should be made personal examples of. One of these letters further declared, "that atonement shall be had, atonement which will make human nature shudder!" The Judge then asked do you think there is any doubt of any other person having wrote them? To which he answered, "I will not swear they are Ingham's hand-writing." Mr. Selby was then asked, if the length of Mr. Nunn's pieces had been generally complained of, to which he replied, they had and that he himself had, through his recommendation, caused the rack to be applied, to prevent such complaints in future.

Rupert Renshaw, another warehouseman of Mr. Nunn's, was then shewn the letters; and he stated upon oath, that they were in the prisoner's handwriting; that his knowledge of such hand-writing arose from having seen the prisoner write invoices, orders, and general book accounts.

Q. Have you not a person in your warehouse of the name of Flannagan?—A. Yes.

Where is he?—From home, Sir; he is gone to see his friends.

Was he not served with a subpoena?—Not that I know of.

Was he not served with a form of one?—Yes; but it was not properly filled up.

Do you know who sent him that subpoena, the prosecutor or the prisoner?— I do not.

Were not applications frequently made to see him ?—Yes.

Who answered the person who applied?-I did, sometimes.

Did you know the person?—No.

When did Flannagan leave town?—Yesterday morning.

How old is this Flannagan?—He is upwards of twenty.

He is under your orders, I suppose?—Yes.

Tell me, Sir, who sent him out of the way?— I did.

What did you send him out of the way for, Sir?—On business which I could not transact myself.

Here the Judge shook his head, and, emphatically, said, "I do not like it."

Mr. CLARKE then disclaimed any knowledge on the part of the Crown of this unfair proceeding; and, at the suggestion of the Judge, offered to put off the trial till the next Assizes, and liberate the prisoner on bail. The prisoner, however, refused the proffered favour, and the trial went on, when he was acquitted.

DERBY, MARCH 18.

At this place, as well as at Nottingham, the Assizes were never attended by greater crowds of persons of every rank, nor were ever listened to with greater interest. And we here congratulate the county of Derby on the breaking up of one of the most formidable and dangerous gangs of nightly depredators that has infected England for many years; a gang formed and directed in their operations by a character worthy to be ranked with Jonathan Wild, of the name of John England, who resided at a little stonehouse, the first on the right hand on entrance into Derby from the Nottingham road. It is worthy of remark, that this gang was wholly mule up of deserters, with the exception of England, who, as a brewer, labourer, and petty bukster, used every possible art to keep up the shadow of reputation, for the purpose of finding a cover for the rest. He never went out himself with his comrades to plunder, but always pointed out the object for their depredations; and his concubine (the wife of a person of the name of Matthew Bush, of Wessington, in Derbyshire; who was principal witness against one of the depredators in these important trials, and who was attempted to be seized as a deserter as he entered the hall,) provided them with caps, masks, and other things necessary to form a proper disguise. For these aids he used to have a share of the plunder; but at length he outwitted himself.

Friday morning three of these depredators, *James Tomlinson*, *Percival Cook*, and *John England* were put to the bar, charged with entering a dwelling-house, at midnight, on the 23d of December, and robbing Mr. Samuel Hunt, at Ocbrock Mill, in the county of Derby, of thirty-five one pound notes, and other articles.

The evidence being clear against them, the prisoners were found Guilty. Cook and Tomlinson were then convicted on another indictment, of the robbery `of the house of Mr. Brentneal, at Lock-grange.

*Samuel Sellers* and *William Elliot*, charged with frame-breaking, within the precincts of Swanwick, is Derbyshire, were brought to the bar; and Samuel Hill, frame-work knitter, who resides at Swanwick Delve, deposed, that he knew the prisoners;—and that on the 9th of December, some persons passed by his house, when one of them said to him—"We shall come again soon;" that he met a man disguised soon after; that he sat up till half past two in the morning, when he went to bed, thinking all was safe for that night; that his wife said, (he being hard of hearing) they ate breaking two frames; got up and opened the door half-char, to peep; went out and saw two men with guns in their hands; said, "you are all neighbours, and break the frames and be d———d!" He then stated that he found three frames upon the common. On his cross-examination, he said that be could not tell how the men were dressed nor did he know whether their faces were black.

Ann Jackson, sister to the witness, deposed, that she resides in a small house adjoining to her brother's work-shop, the window in the sleeping room of which is nailed up with barrel lags, through one of which is a bung-hole, which, to keep out the cold, is stuffed up with rags. She was alarmed about three in the morning alluded to, and said to the man who lodged with her, "are they breaking cinders in the road so soon?" She then pulled the rags out of the bunghole, and peept, when she exclaimed, "Oh Lord! I wish I had not looked!" to which her lodger replied, "prithee what's the matter?" "why, I know them all!" "hold thy tongue," (replied the lodger) "or we shall all be hanged!" She then went on to state, she saw three men, two of whom, with black faces, were breaking a frame with hammers is the road, and one standing on the causeway with a candle and lanthorns to light them. Knew that the prisoner Elliott and George Bacon were them men who broke the frame, and that Sellers, the other prisoner, was the man who held the light— was quite sure it were them.

Several witnesses deposed, that Ann Jackson was not to be believed upon her oath; and both the prisoners had most excellent characters given them.—The Jury found them—*Not Guilty*.

Leicester Journal - Friday 27 March 1812

TRIAL OF THE FRAME-BREAKERS AT NOTTINGHAM

The Grand Jury were sworn in on Monday, and Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect:—

"Gentlemen—Nothing could give me greater satisfaction, amidst the troubled state to which this has been reduced by a number of misguided individuals, than to see so respectable a Jury assembled, as a barrier between guilt and innocence; and as a safeguard to property, to our liberties, and to our lives. The calendar laid before me does grant credit to the moral state of the county, with the exception of one crime, which swells the awful list. It is not for me to enquire whether the persons who have thus involved themselves in trouble, have any just cause of complaint; because, if grievances do really exist, the proper, and the only way to get them redressed is to apply to the legislature of the country. But this should likewise be particularly remembered, that while the complainants continue in a state of open violation of the law, even the Legislature will not attend to their prayers.

And, to add to their sufferings, partly brought about by their own misconduct, the law will be too strong for them— many of them will fall victims to their own daring folly: for the law must and shall be obeyed. The violent proceedings, if persevered in much longer, may have the effect of driving the lace manufacture from Nottingham; for why cannot it be carried on at any other place as well as at this? It is true, that this appears to be the native seat of this branch of the British lace manufacture; and no doubt it will be grateful, as long as it is treated with indulgence and care; but when that ceases to be the case, it may leave those who have been fed by its bounty in a state of deep repentance for having exercised their own folly and violence. The length of time these outrages have been carried on, might almost make it a matter of inquiry, whether the Magistrates of the County have done their duty; but the highly respectable assemblage of Noblemen and Gentleman this morning renders such an inquiry unnecessary; for none can doubt but that their duty has been done.—His Lordship then gave it, both as his own and Lord Ellenborough's opinion, the latter of which he produced in writing, that it was the bounden duty of every good citizen, particularly the wealthy, to risk their lives for the protection of private property; and he hoped, by exertions like these, aided by the salutary rigour of the law, that the misguided would see their error. After stating that when he left the town the assizes would only be adjourned, and that upon the seizure of any rioters a Judge would come down and act upon the present Commission, his Lordship proceeded to state, *that the act of one individual in a riotous multitude, become the act of the whole*; mud consequently that every man became accountable, in the eye of the law, for the misdeeds of his neighbour, when thus assembled. On the subject of collecting money for lawless purposes, his Lordship said, that the person obtaining money by means of intimidation, subjects himself to the punishment which attaches itself to that crime which is perpetrated through the application of such money; and that those who give money *freely* for the promotion of a lawless purpose, likewise stand amenable to the jaw in the same degree as the former. His Lordship concluded by enjoining the Nobility and Gentry to remain at their respective seats, while the troubles, or the probability of their renewal, continued; and likewise with enjoining the Grand Jury to do their duty, without prejudice or partiality to one party or the other.

William Carnel, aged 22, and Joseph Maples, aged 16, were put to the bar, and pleaded not guilty. Mr. Clarke, leading Counsel for the Crown, opened the case. Elizabeth Braithwaite stated, that in January last, her husband was a stocking-maker, residing at Old Basford, who kept seven plain cotton frames occupied by five apprentices, one journeyman of the name of Towlson, and himself On the 3d of Jan. in the evening, a person knocked at the door, and asked for Towlson. The door was bolted, but before she could open it, it was forced, and a man entered, whom she believed to be Carnel; that he walked into the shop with a hammer, and broke the end of a slur bar, eleven more followed, and the first man who entered stood as a guard to the rest. On being desired to point Carnel out, and to look at one of the Sheriff's Officers who stood near to Carnel she pointed out the man, and said, that is Carnel. She said that Carvel had given her a *nudge* over the shoulder with a hammer, in consequence of which he had been lame ever since. She declared she was no wise dismayed, for she saw it was of no use to oppose them. She knew Carnel by his voice, but dared not call him by his name, but that it was him she had no doubt Maples clapped a pistol to her breast, with this exclamation, "Hang you, I'll shoot you, if you don't held your noise." She seized the pistol, turned the muzzle towards his throat, and drew the trigger: had it gone off, must have shot him, but it was not charged. In the mean time she heard some one call out "My lads, work on," when the hammers went like those in a smith's shop. The mischief was all done in about 20 minutes.—On her cross-examination she admitted that she had said to a Mrs. Jackson, that a person, of the name of Wootton had first entered the house, and that he absconded the next day, but said that she only intended to "gorge" Mrs. Jackson, who she knew was pumping her. John Braithwaite confirmed his wife's evidence.—Serjeant Rough put in as a question to the Judge, whether to constitute at theft the intention of thieving was not necessary to be proved? To this suggestion the Judge assented, and as it was his opinion that the frame-breakers had no other object in view than that of *breaking frames*, he wished the Jury to divest their minds of that part of the charge. The evidence on the part of the Crown being closed, the prisoners were called upon for their defence, when Carnel declared, that Mrs. Braithwaite had made a different statement before the Magistrates when he was committed, to what she had done then, respecting his treatment of her husband, as she had then admitted, that instead of his *nudging* her husband with a hammer, he had, she believed, been the means of saving his life. The Judge noted this circumstance, and said, it would stand in his favour another day, if he were then found guilty. On the part of Maples, it was stated on oath, by Sarah Rawson, Ann Rawson, and Joseph Rawson, that he, on the evening the frames were broken was at the house of the latter from a quarter before seven till past twelve o'clock, and had never been away more than two or three minutes that whole time. Francis Syson made oath that Carnel was at his house on business, from half past six till ten minutes before eight, on the night the frames were broken. Three other witnesses spoke to the same effect. After a trial of six hours, The Jury returned a verdict of *Not Guilty* for *Guilty of Frame-breaking*, against Carnel, when his Lordship desired them to reconsider their verdict, pointing out the impropriety of disuniting the burglarious entry from the simple felony of breaking the frames; but all the alteration which the Jury chose to make was, to find them both *Guilty of Frame-breaking only*, thus doing away the capital part of the charge. His Lordship then addressed the prisoners in a solemn and impressive manner, and told them, that if the burglarious part of the charge had been found against them, he should have found himself obliged, for the sake of an example, and to put an end to such disgraceful outrages, to have exerted the full authority of the law, as it was, he had only power to sentence them to *transportation for fourteen years*. Robert Puley, aged 16, was charged with *frame-breaking*, at Sutton-in-Ashfield. He pleaded guilty, and shewed great signs of contrition. The Judge sentenced him to *seven years transportation*. J. Peck, aged 17, for frame-breaking, at Sutton-in-Ashfield. Robert Betts, hosier, at that place, deposed, that on the 13th of November, in the afternoon, four or five men approached his house, and asked permission to break his frames, and on his refusal, a multitude approached his house, and on a gun being fired shouted for the hammer-men to come up. He then fled for his own safety, aud on his return found more than twenty frames broken, and some of his household furniture. The prisoner was proved to have been present, encouraging the rioters. He was found *Guilty*, and sentenced to transportation for fourteen years.
  
On Wednesday, March 18, Benjamin Hancock, aged 21, was tried for the same offence, found guilty, and sentenced to fourteen years transportation, as were Marshal and Green to seven years transportation; aud John Osborne was acquitted.

On the 13th inst. Sir John Bailey, Knt. opened the commission. After the Grand Jury were sworn, his Lordship addressed them in a short but eloquent speech. On the frame-breaking cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, where the frames were, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of breaking frames only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if, on the contrary, other damage had been done, then the offence was capital. On the latter subject he also observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a true bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the prisoners, as cases of this nature should not be brought before a petty jury, except on the clearest evidence possible. His Lordship concluded, by most earnestly enjoining the Gentlemen of the Jury to lay aside all prejudice against the prisoners; and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty. On Monday, came on the trial of George Hinchcliffe, alias George Haigh, alias Thomas Hinchcliffe, alias Thomas Haigh, aged 27, a native of Thornhill, near Wakefield, charged with stealing a brown mare, the property of Mr. John Oldroyd, of Middlestown, in the parish of Thornhill aforesaid, farmer: he was found guilty, and received sentence of Death. W. Carmel, 22, and Joseph Maples, 16, charged with having, on the 3d of January last, entered by force the dwelling-house of John Braithwaite, of Basford, and with having wilfully and maliciously broken and destroyed seven stocking-frames. The trial lasted upwards of six hours, and they were both found guilty of frame-breaking only, and immediately sentenced to be transported for fourteen years. Robert Poley, aged 16, pleaded guilty to an indictment, charging him with breaking and destroying a stocking-frame, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton-in-Ashfield; but, in consequence of his youth, he was only sentenced to be transported for seven years. Joseph Peck, aged 17, charged with wilfully destroying a stocking-frame, at Sutton-in-Ashfield, the property of Francis Betts, was found guilty, and sentenced to fourteen years transportation. After the judge had passed sentence on the above prisoners, he told them, that if the disturbances which had lately disgraced the county were found to have ceased, probably they might have their sentences mitigated; but if, on the contrary, they still continued, he most solemnly informed them, their sentences would be confirmed. William Wells, alias Black, charged with highway robbery near Mansfield, was found guilty, and immediately received sentence of Death, but was reprieved. Judge Bailey informed the Jury, that as he could not remain at Nottingham past Friday, he should return after the conclusion of his circuit, and finish the trials of the prisoners.

### The Trial of Carnel and Maples, March 1812

In the matter of Carnel and Maples, frames were clearly broken, and the capital charge of burglary essentially dropped, which possibly helped secure both convictions, rather than just one. Although alibis were provided, the Judge cast doubt on their reliability as part of his summing up, on the grounds that witnesses providing the alibis *"had measured the time rather by the occurrences of the evening, than by the accurate movements of a time-piece"*.

NOTTINGHAM ASSIZES.

The Commission of Assize was opened in the Shire and Town Halls on Friday the 13th instant, when Mr. JUSTICE BAILEY addressed the Grand Jury to the following effect:—

His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter. On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, *and no other damage had been done*, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence were perfectly clear to their view of the question, they then would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a Petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.

Tuesday, March 17.

The Court was crowded to excess, by persons of all ranks, anxious to hear the trials of the prisoners confined on suspicion of Frame-breaking. Serjeant Vaughan and Mr. Reader, retained, in the first instance, as Counsel for the prisoners, had received an order from the Treasury to act as Counsel against them, and this order they obeyed.

*William Carnel*, aged 22, and *Joseph Maples*, aged 16, both of Basford, were placed at the Bar, and pleaded not guilty. After an opening speech from Mr. Clarke,

Elizabeth Braithwaite, the first witness called, stated, that in Jan. last, she resided at Old Basford; that her husband, John Braithwaite was a stocking-maker, and at the time stated in the indictment, he kept seven plain cotton frames, which were occupied by five apprentices, one journeyman, of the name of Towlson, and himself. She further stated, that on the 3d of January, about ten minutes before eight in the evening, a person knocked at the door, and asked for Towlson; that the door was bolted; and, before she could open it, it was forced, and a man entered, whom she saw have hold of the outer handle of the door, he fell over a chair, and believes it was Carnel, mentioned in the indictment; that he walked into the shop with a hammer over his arm, and broke the end of a slur-bar; that eleven more entered after him; that the first man who entered stood as guard to the rest; and that one man whom she knew, and who used a hammer, is not yet taken. Here the witness was desired to look round the Court, and point the prisoner, Carnel, out. She turned round very attentively several times, and declared she could not see him, and that if he was there, he must have held down his head—thought his imprisonment would alter his appearance; but not so much as to prevent her from owning him, except he was disguised, *for she had known him from a child*. She was then ordered to mount the table in the centre of the Court, to try if by that means she could identify him—she did so, and after twice pacing it round, she pointed out a man who was mixed among the spectators, whose features she thought was like Carnel. She was then desired to look at one of the Sheriff's officers, who stood near to Carnel, and give her opinion, *if that was the man*. On fixing her eyes closely upon that quarter, she pointed out the man; and said, "that is Carnel." She was then asked whether she knew any other person near him, when she pointed to another in the prisoner's box, and said, "that is Maples." On being asked why she knew Carnel to be one of the men who had violated the premises of her husband, she said, that when the scuffle was going on in the shop, she called out for her husband to be brought out, and that Carnel (after having given her husband a nudge over the shoulder with a hammer, in consequence of which he had been lame ever since,) complied with her request; and that in the bustle the mask was pulled off his face, which she immediately recognized, though his cheeks and nose were blacked, and his upper-lip red. She knew Carnel by his voice, but dared not call him by his name; but that it was him, she had no doubt. Maples clapt a pistol to her breast, with this exclamation, "Dam you for a bitch, I will shoot you if you don't hold your noise;" she seized the pistol, turned the muzzle towards his throat, and drew the trigger, and had it gone off it must have shot him; but believed it was not charged, because it struck fire without going off. While this was going on she heard some one call out, "My lads, work on!" which order she thought, was obeyed, as, she said, the hammers went like those in a smith's shop. When the seven frames were broken, she stated that seven men went through the shop windows, and five out at the house door; among the latter of whom was Maples, who she saw charging a pistol after he went out; she had no other way of identifying his person than those above described. She stated the mischief to be done in 20 or 22 minutes, which makes the ending of the time 12 minutes after eight; and that Carnel returned in 20 minutes after on pretence of looking at the ruins; and said, if *Ned* had not done his work well, he was come to complete it; when she said, You rogue, are you come again? you are not the man you was some time ago; to which he replied, I have not been here before,—you have, said she, for I know you right well! She then said, that his head was wet, as if he had been washing himself; that black streaks were visible from his ears to his chin; and that she said, you have been to the upper pump to wash you, and you are not now disguised.

Nothing material came out on the cross-examination, except that witness had told a Mrs. Jackson, that one Wotton had first entered the house; but this she had done, as she said, to "gorge" Mrs Jackson, who was "pumping" her to tell tales.

The evidence of John Braithwaite, the next witness, was in substance the same as his wife's, except that he did not profess to know anything of Maples' person.

The prisoners were charged with burglary, for entering a dwelling-house, as the Judge said, after the light of heaven had ceased to enable one man to distinguish the features of another; and stealing thereout two files, one rasp, two pair of pliers, and a hand-vice, as well as for feloniously breaking the stocking-frames. But here Serjeant Rough put it as a question to the Judge, whether, to constitute a theft, the *intention* of thieving was not necessary to be proved? To this the Judge assented; and it was his opinion that the frame-breakers had no other object in view *than that of breaking frames*, he wished the Jury to divest their minds of that part of the charge which related to stealing the articles named above; in particular as nothing of the kind had been found upon the premises or persons of the prisoners.

John Griffin and ———— Burrows, two constables, deposed that they seized and searched Maples, on the 4th of January, and found upon his person a pistol and some flints, which were produced in Court. Mrs. Braithwaite, however, believed that the pistol then produced was not the one she had seen in the possession of Maples; and he said his father had lent it to him to shoot sparrows with some months ago, who had found it in a particular place in the parish of Wollaton, which he described.

The evidence on the part of the Crown being closed, the prisoners were called upon for their defence, when Carnel declared that Mrs. Braithwaite had made a different statement before the Magistrates at the time of his commitment to what she had done then, respecting his treatment of her husband at the time the frames were broken: and on her re-examination, she admitted that instead of Carnel "nudging" her husband with a hammer, he had, she believed, been the means of saving his life. The Judge noted this circumstance, and said it would stand in Carnel's favor another day, providing he was then found guilty.

An *alibi* was positively sworn to both, on behalf of Maples and Carnel. Three witnesses deposed, that the former was in their presence, white-washing a house from 7 o'clock, on the evening mentioned in the indictment, till past 12 o'clock; and that he had never been off the premises. And four witnesses traced the time Carnel had been in their presence from half past 6, to a quarter before nine on the same night.

Here, with the exception of what related to character, which was much to the credit of both the prisoners, the whole of the evidence closed; and the learned Judge in delivering his charge to the Jury, stated, that notwithstanding the time had been apparently so connectively accounted for on the part of the prisoners, during the space in which the frames were stated to have been broken, yet it was very possible, for these persons to have been deceived in the time to the extent of 15 or 20 minutes, and especially in the case of Carnel, because they had measured the time rather by the occurrences of the evening, than by the accurate movements of a time-piece; and this rendered it very possible for them to have been at the scene of action.

After a patient hearing of six hours, the Jury returned a verdict of *Not Guilty* for Maples, and *Guilty of Frame-breaking* against Carnel; when his Lordship desired them to re-consider their verdict, and pointed out to them the impropriety of disuniting the burglarious entry into the house from the act of simple felony, occasioned by breaking the frames. All the alteration however, which the Jury chose to make, was that of uniting Maples with Carnel, and finding them both *Guilty of Frame-breaking only*, thus doing away the capital part of the charge.—The verdict being recorded, his Lordship addressed the prisoners in a most solemn and impressive manner. He deeply lamented, that two young men, whose character, till then, had stood unimpeached, should have so far forgotten their duty to themselves and the laws of their country, as to let their misguided zeal, and the evil counsels of others older and possessing more corrupt hearts than themselves, ever have led them into so perilous a situation; a situation which would have been far more perilous, if the burglarious part of the charge had been found against them; for in that case, as in the present, he should have felt himself constrained for the sake of example, in order to put an end to such disgraceful outrages, to have exerted the full authority of the law; nor did he know but he should have ordered it to have been carried into execution. As it now stands, the extent of his power was to order them to be transported for the term of *Fourteen Years*, to any part of his Majesty's foreign settlements to which his Majesty's Privy Council might direct; which sentence he accordingly pronounced. At the same time, he gave them to understand, if they behaved themselves, and *the tumults in the neighbourhood ceased*, they might expect the hands of mercy to be extended towards them in lessening their punishment.

*Robert Poley*, aged 16, charged with frame-breaking at Sutton-in-Ashfield, on the 13th of November last, was next brought to the bar, and pleaded guilty; in consequence of marks of contrition the Judge sentenced him to seven years transportation.

After which, Joseph Peck, aged 17, was put to the bar, and convicted of being concerned on the night of the 13th of November, 1811, in breaking upwards of 20 frames, in the house of Francis Bettis, and sentenced to *Fourteen years Transportation*.
```

With the penalties of the Frame Breaking case not yet available to the court, it is interesting to note how clearly the Judge appears to have clarified the different sentences for frame breaking, a felony, and as such punishable by transportation, with the capital sentence of burglary.

ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE.

...

At Nottingham assizes, William Carnel, aged 22, and Joseph Maples, aged 16, for entering by force into the dwelling-house and shop of John Braithwaite, at Basford, on the 3d of January last, and therein breaking and destroying seven stocking frames, after a patient hearing, were found guilty. The Judge explained the law of the case, which applied equally to the cases of all the other prisoners, namely, that should the Jury be of opinion that the prisoners entered the house with violence for the purpose of frame-breaking only, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if they were of opinion they had entered the premises with other designs, and that they had done other damage, then the offence was capital. The Jury brought in a verdict, finding the prisoners guilty of frame-breaking, and they were both sentenced to 14 years' transportation.—Two other prisoners, viz. Benjamin Hancock, aged 21, and Joseph Peck, aged 17, for riot and frame-breaking, at Sutton-in-Ashfield, received a similar sentence. Gervas Marshall, aged 17, George Poley, aged 16, and George Green (the latter a prisoner on bail), for frame-breaking, at Sutton aforesaid, were sentenced to seven years' transportation each.—George Hinchliffe, for horse stealing, and William Wells, alias Black Tom (a notorious character,) for highway robbery, were found guilty, and received sentence of death; but the Judge was pleased to reprieve them before he left the town.

```

Sentenced to transportation, the Maples, and Carnell, along with several others under similar sentence, were transported off to the hulks.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 04 April 1812

At an early hour on Monday morning last, the following persons, convicted of frame-breaking, at the late Assizes, were removed from the county gaol, under the care of Mr. Wright, assisted by Parkes, Atkin, and three other Officers front Bow Street, in order to be put on board the hulks at Woolwich, (viz.) Joseph Maples, William Carnell, Benjamin Hancock, and Joseph Peck, under sentence of transportation for fourteen years; and Gervas Marshall, Robert Poley, and George Green, under sentence of transportation for seven years each. They were escorted by a detachment of hussars to Leicester, front whence they were to be guarded by the Blues to the place of their destination.—A Petition on behalf of these unfortunate individuals was sent to the Prince Regent last week, praying for mitigation of punishment, which was signed by upwards of four thousand frame-work knitters.
```

The removal of the men was apparently not a simple affair, however. Fearing not just an anticipated mob protesting for the release of the men, but perhaps also a rescue attempt, it seems as if quite unusual measures were adopted to effect the safe transfer of the prisoners.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTERS.

The removal of the four Nottingham Rioters, sentenced to fourteen years transportation at the late assizes; and three for seven years, was very properly not left to the common mode, merely by the gaolers, but every due precaution was taken to guard against any disturbance, or to prevent any attempt at a rescue by their deluded associates. Accordingly, Pearkes and Adkins, the Bow street Officers, attended by several of the patrole, were dispatched to Nottingham to make arrangements for the safe and quiet removal of the convicts. They arrived at Nottingham on Saturday sennight, when they proceeded to make secret arrangements for removing the convicts as privately as possible. The Officers arranged with the General of the District for a party of cavalry to guard them for some distance oa the road. They agreed with a Stage-coach Proprietor for the whole of the coach, inside and out, and to J start at an hour it was not accustomed to do. On Monday morning, soon after five o'clock, the stage-coach and four drove up to the door of the prison; another pair of horses were stationed near at hand, they were put to without delay; at that instant the convicts had handcuffs slipped on them, having been previously chained, and they were hurried into and upon the coach, Pearkes and Adkins going one inside and the other outside. At the instant the convicts came out of the prison, a man was stationed to give the signal to the cavalry, who were at a short distance; they immediately mounted their horses, rode up, and surrounded them; the whole was managed so secretly and so instantaneously, that there was not forty people collected. They proceeded on very quietly till they got to Leicester, where they stopped to breakfast, and the time occupied in that, and the novelty of a military guard escorting a stage-coach, attracted a very great crowd; however every thing was perfectly quiet. The military proceeded a few miles out of Leicester, and then all danger being considered at an end, the Officers dismissed them, and arrived at Newgate with them on Tuesday; and on Thursday delivered them at the Hulks, at Woolwich.

### The Trial of Cook and Tomlinson, March 1812

As far as the trial of Cook and Tomlinson were concerned, the attacks were clearly criminal in the sense of burglarious intent.

At Derby Assizes, Perceval Cook, and James Tomlinson, alias Fruz, for burglariously breaking into, and robbing the dwelling-house of Mr. Samuel Hunt, of Ockbrook Mill, and also for a burglary committed at the dwelling-house of Mr. John Brentnall, of Locko Grange, were capitally convicted, and are left for execution. John England, convicted of being an accessary before the fact in the burglary at Locko Grange, and an accessary after the fact in the burglary at Ockbrook Mill; and John Thompson, for burglariously entering into, robbing the dwelling-house of Mr. Thos. Theobald, at Wilstrop, were each capitally convicted, and received sentence of death, but were afterwards reprived. (Thomas Draper, an accomplice in the burglaries committed at Ockbrook Mill and Locko Grange, was admitted evidence for the Crown.)

Whilst a demand was made in one of the houses that a contract be signed regarding the lowering of the price of corn, we might wonder whether this was just a veneer to try to gain some "Luddite credibility" for the attack.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 11 April 1812

DERBY ASSIZES.— At these assizes last week, *James Tomlinson*, *Perceval Cook*, and *John England*, were found guilty of an outrage connected with the frame-breaking system—that of forcibly entering the house of Mr. Samuel Hunt, at Ockbrook Mill, on the 23d of December last, compelling him to sign a paper that he would lower the price of corn and flour, and robbing his house of a considerable sum in bank bills and other effects. -They were all sentenced to death, and repeatedly assured by the Judge that no hope of mercy remained to them.— *John Thompson* was found guilty of a similar offence, at the house of Thomas Theobald, at Wilsthorpe. The Judge, in passing sentence of death upon him, was peculiarly impressive, and very much affected. His Lordship said he understood that the prisoner's father had ten or eleven children, and that his grandfather now lay dead in the house of a broken heart, on account of the prisoner's abandoned conduct, and the fate that hung over him. The Judge gave him hopes of mercy, in consequence of some important discoveries he had made respecting the desperate gang with which he associated.

When the death sentence was passed, it was required to be carried out within a matter of days, and as much mileage as possible was often extracted to exhort others not to go down a similar path, or they too would meet an equally terrifying end.

Execution of Perceval Cook and James Tomlinson.— Perceval Cook, and James Tomlinson, alias Fruz, who were convicted of burglaries at Derby assizes, were executed about half-past twelve o'clock oa Friday se'nnight, pursuant their sentence, on a new drop erected in front of the county gaol, in the presence of a numerous concourse spectators.— From the time of their condemnation they conducted themselves with the utmost propriety, and were unremitting in their supplication obtain Divine mercy. A short time previous to their execution they received the sacrament from the hands of the Rev. N. Bayley, chaplain to the prison, (who has been most assiduous in his application to these unfortunate men), in the presence of Thomas Draper, who was admitted evidence for the Crown, and William Tomlinson (the brother of James Tomlinson), now under sentence of transportation for uttering forged Bank of England notes.—This scene, and the separation of the two brothers was truly affecting, and may be better conceived than described. James Tomlinson preserved his firmness of mind to the last, and continued to exhort Draper and his fellow-prisoners for a considerable time in the most anxious and persuasive manner to refrain from their former course of life; and after spending a short time in prayer on the platform, they met their fate with becoming fortitude,-Their bodies after hanging the usual time were given to their friends, and taken away the same evening for interment.

Cooke was a native of Dale Abbey, and we understand of religious and industrious parents, who gave him a suitable education, and bound him apprentice to a framework knitter at Spondon; but his master dying before the expiration of his time, he went from Spondon to Nottingham, where he has left a wife and two children, the eldest about seven years of age. He was a deserter from the 43d regiment of foot, and declared he had not committed any material crime previous to October last.

James Tomlinson was born in the neighbourhood of Hinckley; was by trade a framework knitter, and is a deserter from several regiments. His parents are travelling hawkers, in the hardware line.
