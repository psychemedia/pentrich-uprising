<p>At the start of 1811, the pressure was on to try to reduce the costs of lace and hose manufacture. The prices per piece were fixed, but it seems that some manufacturers were looking to find ways around the traditional pricing, to the detriment of the peoople who worked for them, whilst others, or so it seemed, sought to do right by theuir workers:</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 26 January 1811</p>
<p>To the Editor of the NOTTINGHAM JOURNAL.</p>
<p>There appeared in your last week’s paper an Advertisement, signed by a number of Manafacturers in this town, stating their disapprobation of any reduction in the prices of making Silk and Cotton Hose; we see amongst them the names of several Houses who have, for a length of time, been in the habit of making Women’s Hose at the price of Slender Women’s, and Slender Women’s at the price of Maids’, and other sizes in proportion; this, undoubtedly, is a reduction.— There are also others amongst them, who, under a pretence of leaving out the fashion, have considerably reduced the prices; we will just name one article— the standard price of Slender Women’s, 30 guage, Cotton Hose is 17s. per dozen; this article is now making at 12s. per dozen, Welted, under the pretence of deducting 1s. for leaving out the shape, 1s. for being bound in down the leg, instead of being narrowed, and the remainder for having slit partings, in lieu of being spliced and leaving out the bindings in at the heel and beginning of the foot bottom; so that 5s. per dozen is deducted from the Workman, for work left out, which is not worth more to him than 3s. at the utmost; other qualities are also made on the same principle.</p>
<p>Now, we would ask those Gentlemen who thus publicly avow their disapprobation of reducing the price of making Hose, what they call this but a Reduction.—We have had much conversation with the Workmen on this subject, and they all say that the fashion thus left out is by no means adequate to the price deducted for it; in which opinion we most decidedly agree with them.</p>
<p>It is well known, that Stocking-makers who have frames of their own, or independent frames, have taken work at very reduced prices, for the sake of employment: this essentially injured both us and our Workmen; and it became necessary for us to consider, whether we would discharge our old Workmen, let our own frames stand still, and employ the independent frames at the reduced prices, or whether we would give our own Workmen the preference of work, at such a price as would enable us to cope with those Manufacturers who, by employing independent frames, and making their goods on the plans above described, have hitherto possessed such great advantages over us. These reasons, therefore, made it indispensable for us to reduce the price to our own Workmen, leaving it entirely at their oprtion, whether they would take the prices we offered them, or  work on the same principle as the independent frames.</p>
<p>We have been told by some Gentlemen who have signed that Advertisement, that we should have followed the same system that others have done; then no notice would have been taken of it:—to which we answer, that, <em>never having been accustomed</em> to reduce the stated prices given by the Trade at large, by any such mode as making one size and paying for a less, we do not choose <em>now</em> to adopt such a measure.</p>
<p>It remains only for us to state, if these Gentlemen are really anxious to prevent any reduction in the price taking place, they will return to the old standard mode of making and paying for their Work; then there will not be found any Individual amongst them who will not pay the old price with greater pleasure than<br />

<p><em>It seems that despite their protestations agains the reduction of wages, the signatories to that letter were also to reduce wages in the coming weeks.</em></p>

<p>Morning Chronicle - Friday 15 March 1811</p>
<p>RIOTOUS EXCESSES AT NOTTINGHAM.—It is with the deepest regret we have to communicate the occurrence of alarming disturbances and outrageous excesses in the neighbourhood of Nottingham. Letters from that place state, that on Tuesday last the workmen, to the number of one thousand, assembled in the market-place, and from thence proceeded in a body to Arnold, a distance of about five miles, when their numbers were increased to between two and three thousand. Thus augmented in strength, they shortly evinced a determination to adopt measures of violence, and parties proceeded to enter the houses and destroy the frames of several of the manufacturers. The cause assigned for these afflicting outrages was the extreme distress suffered by themselves and families, in consequence of the stoppage of work. With any further particulars we are at present unacquainted, but we have to express our sincere hopes that these mistaken men must have been soon made sensible that by the destruction of the property of others, they not only could not alleviate their own misery, but that, on the contrary, they must materially increase it.</p>

<p>Nottingham Review - Friday 15 March 1811</p>
<p>On Monday, some hundreds of framework-knitters from the county, assembled in the market-place; they loudly complained of those employers, who had set the example of reducing their earnings at this calamitous time. The constables were ordered out to preserve the peace; and a troop of dragoons paraded the market-place from three in the afternoon till after nine at night. But there was so little indication of riot, that the ordinary business of the fair was not interrupted. These sons of sorrow, however, seemed to have <em>method in their madness</em>, for when night drew on, and they found the alarm their appearance had created, had occupied the attention of the civil power, and given employment to the soldiery, they marched in good order to Arnold, about three miles from hence, where they destroyed about sixty frames belonging to those hosiers who had rendered themselves the most obnoxious to the workmen, without committing any other violence. On Tuesday evening, a party of dragoons was sent to Arnold, but the rioters had retired to the neighbouring villages, where the <em>(sic)</em> continued their depredations in frame breaking without molestation, nor have we, as yet, heard of any of them having been apprehended.— On the 17th of June, 1779, about the same number of frames were broken at Arnold on a similar occasion, which caused the passing of a Bill, which was taken into the House of Commons by D. P. Coke, Esq. which makes it transportation wilfully to injure a stocking frame.</p>
<p>On Thursday last, before the Mayor, and Mr. Alderman Swann, the sitting Magistrates at the Guildhall, a Manufacturer of lace, concerned in employing persons in the said manufactory to work-up cotton yarn into lace, was convicted in, and paid the penalty of £10, for paying in goods, and not in money, one of his workmen, the wages, or pricea greed on, for making a piece of cotton-lace, contrary to the Statute in such case made and provided; which penalty was by the said Justices appropriated as the Act directs.</p>

<p>RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM.— The <em>Statesman</em> of this Evening says:— “The following, we are sorry to state, we have received from unquestionable authority:— On Tuesday last the workmen, to the number of 1000, assembled in the market-place, Nottingham,and proceeded to Arnold, when they increased to more than 2000, and proceeded to the greatest violence, breaking open the houses and destrying the frames of the masters.”— We have not learnthow this unfortuate circumstance has terminated.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A disposition to riot and tumult, Match 1811</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0002131/18110316/007/0003">https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0002131/18110316/007/0003</a></p>
<p>Nottingham Journal - Saturday 16 March 1811</p>
<p>We are sorry to observe, that a disposition to riot and tumult has manifested itself amongst the operative manufacturers in this neighbourhood, owing to the present depressed state of trade, which has occasioned an abatement in the workmen’s prices, and reduced them to the greatest distress.—A number of individuals from the adjacent villages assembled in this town on Monday last, with a view of representing to their employers the hardships they were subject to, and of intimidating others into a compliance with their demands, by which alone they would be enabled to obtain a subsistence for themselves and families. The assembling of such numbers induced an apprehension on the part of the Mayor and Magistrates, that some violation of the public peace was intended. They, therefore, adopted the most prompt and vigilant measures, by calling out the civil power, and ordering a troop of horse from the barracks, to be in readiness to act in case of necessity. But happily, in the evening, these precautions were rendered useless, by the whole retiring quietly to their homes.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of this place, however, we are concerned to say, that considerable mischief has been done, and the folly of a deluded multitude was, perhaps, never more conspicuous than at Arnold on Monday; when they proceeded with a premeditated determination to destroy some stocking frames employed there, by hosiers of this town, and rented by them of Mr. Bolton, who had retired from business above two years since, and had let his frames on a lease, and engaged to keep them in repair at his own expence; consequently the loss, which we hear will amount to several hundred pounds, will fall entirely upon Mr. Bolton.—The avowed motive of these people to commit acts of so flagrant a nature, was to injure the hosiers who rented the frames; but though they were told by the workmen, in whose hands the frames were, that they belonged to Mr. Bolton, whose name was stamped upon the front bars, they persisted in their determination, and nearly demolished upwards of fifty frames, intending by so doing, to suspend the manufactory until the frames could be repaired, to the prejudice of the hosiers who had engaged them on rent; whereas the fact is, that it will have quite a contrary effect, and be to their advantage, by enabling them to refrain from manufacturing more goods than are really wanted, until the demand for them shall increase.</p>
<p>[We find that, by the Act of the 28th of George III. chap. 55, the maliciously destroying or damaging any Stocking Frame is made felony.]</p>

<p>It is with great concern we hear, that the mischievous proceedings which took place at Arnold last week, have been extended to most of the manufacturing villages in the north western parts of this county, where upwards of one hundred stocking frames, the property of individuals, have been destroyed. These outrages are the more to be deprecated, since they will be attended with less evil to the proprietor, than to the unfortunate workman, who must for a length of time be thrown entirely out of employment.—The persons engaged in these depredations, proceed in small companies, disguised so that their persons may not be known; in some instances, however, their designs have been frustrated by the determined resistance of those who were in employ.—We hope, shortly to be able to announce a happy adjustment of the existing differences between the workmen and their employers.</p>

<p>A correspondent to the <em>Nottingham Journal</em> followed up the editorial commnt of the week before by mildly chastising the mischief-making stocking makers, likening them to spoiled children, and calling on the employers to come together in a resolution that the workmen could not fail to see the sense of.</p>

<p><em>To Persons concerned in the Nottingham Manufactory.</em></p>
<p>It is alarming to hear of the mischief which has been done, and is yet doing, in the Villages around us, in almost every direction; and which seems likely to wear a more serious aspect.</p>
<p>Surely it is the duty of those in office to give full information to Government of these proceedings; that it may immediately take effectual measures to check designs which may yet be only in contemplation.</p>
<p>The folly of the Stocking Weavers, in destroying the Frames belonging to their masters (but many of them the property of persons no way concerned in the trade), is indeed most absurd and infamous.</p>
<p>It is the most effectual way of injuring themselves; by throwing out of work for months, or years, the machines by which they gain a livelihood.</p>
<p>It reminds us of children, who quarrel with their bread and butter, throw it into the dirt in a pet, and then cry because they have nothing to eat.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted, that the Hosiers should avowedly be at variance at such a crisis.</p>
<p>If, instead of reproaching each other in the public prints, they would convene a GENERAL MEETING of the TRADE, and come to a decided Resolution on which to act, and publish the same with the signatures of their respective names at the foot, as has been the usual custom on similar occasions, there can be no doubt, when the Workmen saw these Resolutions, founded upon general consent, that they would consider it in vain to oppose the unanimous determination of their Employers, and quietly return to their work.</p>
<p>It would otherwise be “kicking against the pricks.”</p>

<p>We congratulate the public upon the vigorous proceedings adopted for putting an end to the shameful system of destroying frames, which has been lately pursued in this neighbourhood. In addition to the liberal rewards offered, some of the most active and intelligent Officers from Bow Street are now employed, and have been in the adjacent villages during the last week. Their known ability gives us every reason to expect, that an effectual stop will be put to the diabolical proceedings of a set of men, who, under the pretence of preventing an evil, have inflicted the most grievous injury upon their industrious neighbours, by depriving them of the means of obtaining bread for their families, and have brought on themselves the execration of all good men. The County Magistrates, we learn, have requested the continued services of these vigilant and indefatigable Officers, for an indefinite period. On this subject we cannot refrain from expressing our regret at the culpable apathy exhibited in the late tumultuous proceedings, in cases where the mischief was performed by ten or twelve individuals, in the presence of, perhaps, two or three hundred, who, by being spectators, became abettors in the mischief, and thus justly rendered themselves liable to punishment. We understand, that the County Magistrates have determined to punish with the utmost severity of the law, all persons who may be brought before them, for being present at any riotous and disorderly assemblage, where destruction of property has ensued.</p>

<p>FRAME-BREAKING.—The mischievous spirit of frame-breaking, we regret to state, still continues: on Monday night last, some person or persons entered the workshop of John Stevenson, at Bulwelll, in this neighbourhood, and maliciously broke and destroyed six stocking frames, belonging to different individuals. Not content with this act of mischief, they wantonly set fire to some cotton yarn, and stole and carried away some hose, also divers articles of wearing apparel, and some provisions, The same night two other frames, rented by the said John Stevenson, standing in another work-shop were totally demolished in like manner.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 16 November 1811</p>
<p>VIOLENT OUTRAGES.</p>
<p>We are concerned to state, that great discontents have again broken out amongst the operative manufacturers in various parts of this county, and that a most alarming system of mischief has been carrying on during the present week, at Bulwell, Sutton in Ashfield, and the intermediate villages. The depredations have been almost exclusively confined to the destruction of a certain description of stocking-frames, which, being of a new construction, are supposed by the workmen, likely to prove greatly injurious to the body at large. The town and parish of Bulwell has been a scene of the most violent outrages: on Sunday night last, a number of men, armed with various offensive weapons, attacked the house of one Hollingworth, who had become obnoxious on account of his having some frames at work on the new principle. The latter being apprised of their intention, procured the assistance of his brother-in-law and three or four friends, who, with fire arms, resolved to protect the property: a great many shots were exchanged, and one of the assailants, named John Westby (an inhabitant of Arnold), was mortally wounded. This unfortunate circumstance occasioned the mob to withdraw for a short time, with their wounded companion; but being joined in a lane at some distance from the spot, by fresh numbers, and Westby having expired on the road, they became so exasperated as to return to the attack with redoubled fury. They soon forced an entrance into the house, when the party within found it necessary to make a precipitate retreat, which they accomplished by means of a window at the back part of the house, leaving their fire arms behind them. The rioters, on entering the house, immediately proceeded to demolish the furniture, and in their fury they broke and destroyed every article in the house, together with the frames, the chief object of their vengeance, which they shivered to atoms.— On the following day the mob again collected, and having obtained information of some frames being on the road, belonging to two houses in this town, which the owners were removing from Sutton in Ashfield, they intercepted the waggon at Basford, and dragging the frames out, totally demolished them on the road, throwing part into the Leen. In a similar manner, we understand, the rioters destroyed seven other frames (five wide and two narrow ones), belonging to Job Bramley, which were coming to this town.—On Wednesday, several hundreds collected in the neighbourhood of Arnold, from whence they proceeded to Sutton in Ashfield, where the work of destruction was again commenced, and no less than 37 frames, including the whole in the possession of Francis Betts, were completely demolished.—Here, however, a stop was put to their career, by the arrival of a party of military, upon whose appearance the mob instantly dispersed in all directions.</p>
<p>Many persons concerned in these outrageous proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed to the county gaol to take their trials for the offence. They were brought in last night under an escort of the Bunny troop of yeomanry. Their names are John Bradbury, Gervas Marshall, George Green, and John Clarke.</p>
<p>The High Sheriff, with the most laudable zeal for the preservation of the public peace, has, with the advice of the County Magistrates, considered it expedient to call in the aid of the Holme-Pierrepont and Bunny troops of yeomanry cavalry, whose services, together with the detachment of the 4th dragoons, from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the first regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark troop of yeomanry are in readiness to act, in case of any further disposition to disturbance. The Magistrates are everywhere at their posts, and the greatest praise is due to them for their promptitude and exertions.</p>
<p>Every precautionary measure has been adopted by the Mayor and Magistrates for the preservation of the public peace in this town, and some hundreds of special constables have been sworn in.</p>
<p>The following account of the attack made on Hollingworth’s house, at Bulwell, has been furnished us by the Coroner:—</p>
<p>“Between the hours of one and two on Monday morning last, a number of persons (it is supposed near 300), assembled before the house of Edward Hollingworth, at Bulwell, for the purpose of breaking the stocking frames in Mr. H.’s shop, who, being prepared to defend his property, several shots were fired upon the rioters, and they being also armed with fire arms, fired several shots in at Mr. H.’s windows, and forcing open the house door, the people within retreated up stairs, where they again defended themselves for some time; the people below firing several shots up the stairs, and finding themselves unable to get up stairs, they began to pull down the partition wall which supported the chamber floor, and by that means let the floor down, threatening to murder every man that was in the chamber. Mr. H. and his assistants now seeing they were not able to protect the property in the house, and finding that the rioters would get the floor down, they made their escape through the chamber window, on the back side of the house. The doors, windows, household furniture, and several stocking frames, were all destroyed. Soon after day-light the same morning, the body of John Westby, a framework-knitter, an inhabitant of Arnold, was found dead near the highway upon Bulwell Forest, a short distance from Mr. H.’s house; and on the 12th an inquest was taken on view of the body before Thomas Wright, Gent. Coroner, when it was found that a ball had entered on the left side, a little below the navel, passed through the body, and came out just under the short rib on the right side near the spine. Verdict, <em>That he died of the wound as above justifiably given by the said Edward Hollingworth, or others his assistants, in defence of himself, his family, house, and property</em>.”</p>
<p>The deceased, we understand, has left a wife and two children.</p>
</div>
<p>The troubles in Nottinghamshire were notable enough for them to reported in the London based <em>Morning Post</em>, which gave a summary of the events of the previous week, framed as a reponse of the workers to a decrease in available work caused by the introduction of labour-saving wide frames.</p>

Morning Post - Monday 18 November 1811</p>
<p>SERIOUS RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM.</p>
<p>A riotous spirit has of late been manifested, by the Manufacturers having brought into use a certain wide frame, for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, by which was produced a considerable saving in manual labour, tending still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday night last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinty of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage and riot, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as had in use those particular frames, so obnoxious to them.</p>
<p>A master-weaver, at Bullwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday evening armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being thus in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who did not leave him long in suspense, till they appeared and demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames; the master would subscribe to neither, and was immediately fired upon; several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life, he was in the act of <em>storming</em> the houses, or, in other words, <em>tearing down</em> the window-shutters, to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength and violence. They immediately broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death, had they not made their escape out at the back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed everything that would burn by fire.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to MALBY and BREWETT, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they broke to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the open street.</p>
<p>Other letters we have seen state that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob, belonged to Messrs. WATSON and NELSON, and produced twenty-four dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Tuesday the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages in that quarter, and in the course of that evening they broke and destroyed the frames there of the principal weavers.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, not having finished their work, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill; for now, having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, the mob grew more emboldened, and changed the frame breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide frames, millers, corn-dealers, and all others concerned in raising the price of bread.</p>
<p>On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace-breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the <em>posse comitatis</em>, and the 1st and second regiments of local militia, and a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three o’clock on Friday morning.</p>
<p>All Thursday was employed in assembling together the militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriffs, during the while the mob were enabled to carry on thepredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town wasleft for a moment unprotected, they would make a suddent attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.</p>
<p>Our last advices are to nine o’clock on Friday morning, at which time intelligence had just been received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberly, becuase they were worked by women. The Local Militia were under arms, and the <em>posse comitatis</em> in readiness, but violent measures would not be proceeded in until fresh assistence and advice were received from Government.</p>
</div>
<p>By the end of the week, the editor of the <em>Nottingham Review</em> wrote not of furhter outbreaks of violence, but in some sort of defence of the framework-knitting trade, and against the introduction of low quality “cut up” work. He also identified what he saw as the root cause of the current distress: the ongoing war.</p>

Nottingham Review - Friday 22 November 1811</p>
<p>“The framework-knitting trade of this country, in all its various branches, is of considerable importance in a national point of view, and consequently merits the fostering hand of legislative, as well as individual protection; for it stands pre-eminent in all the markets in the world, where the productions thereof are vendable articles; consequently if it be suffered to work itself into disgrace, for want of legislative protection, the result will be a national evil, as well as be the ruin of some of the most flourishing towns, and an immense number of villages, in the kingdom; that is to say, they <em>flourish</em> when the rulers of the earth permit the markets thereof to be open to competition. Then let us hope that every facility will be given to an application to Parliament, by the wealthy, that they have in their power to give, to prevent <em>cut-up</em> goods from being made. But while we propose measures to prevent future calamities, let us not forget to propose something to remove those that now afflict this neighborhood, as well as every other part of the kingdom, though not at the present time, in the same alarming degree; and what so likely to produce so desirable an effect as petitioning the Prince Regent for peace. From war spring our greatest evils, as from peace would flow our greatest good! Then why not attempt the attainment of so desirable an object? the panacea for all our suffering. The enemy has made various overtures for peace, since the re-commencement of hostilities, which have been invariably rejected by our government, without any overtures having been made on the part of England since the ever-to-be-lamented death of the immortal Fox. It may be said, that the enemy is impervious to a peace, honorable to this country; but how do we know that to be the case? have we made overtures for peace which he has rejected? certainly not! then till we have done so, let us be content to rest part of the blame of the war’s continuance upon our own shoulders; and not like a man, when smarting under the lash of his own imprudence, that lays the cause of his folly at the door of another. But perhaps the Prince may not know the full extent of distress to which the country is reduced by the war; then ought not the manufacturer and the workman to join heart and hand in promoting petitions to him, in which might be explained the full extent of our grievances, and the proper remedy pointed out?”</p>

<p>Nottingham Journal - Saturday 23 November 1811</p>
<p>Nottingham, Friday, Nov. 22.</p>
<p>The lawless and outrageous proceedings which we had the painful duty of recording in our last, have, in a great degree, subsided, owing to the vigorous and decisive measures adopted by the High Sheriff and the Magistrates, aided by the military. Since the apprehension of some of the most active of the rioters, and the assemblage of a considerable military force, the mischievous designs of the more violent have been effectually restrained, and no further attempt to disturb the public peace has been made. Only one instance of frame-breaking has come to our knowledge since our last, and that took place at a house in Acomb Lane, Old Radford, on Monday night last, where one wide frame was broken to pieces. Many threats, however, have been held out against others; and on Tuesday night, in consequence of a stone being thrown through the window of a workshop which was threatened at New Radford, a part of the guard of the Local Militia marched to garrison the house, and also another, which had been threatened in like manner, while the remainder of the guard continued to patrole the road throughout the night, and thus the property was effectually preserved.— It would appear, however, that the frame breaking employment has, for the present been changed for one of a more diabolical nature; on Saturday night last, some vile incendiary set fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Stirrup, of the Swan Inn, Mansfield, by which nearly 20 tons of hay were destroyed. This act of diabolical mischief is supposed to have been perpetrated by some desperate characters out of revenge to Mr. Stirrup, in consequence of having furnished post horses to a party of seven dismounted dragoons, who proceeded with some of the Mansfield yeomanry to suppress the riots at Sutton in Ashfield. A similar revenge was taken on Monday night, by setting fire to a hay rick, belonging to Mr. Lewis. of Snenton, near this town, whose son is a member of the Holme-Pierrepent troop of yeomanry, which was last week called out on duty; and on Tuesday night last, two hay ricks, the property of Mr. Hardstaff and Mr. Toon, at Hucknall Torkard in this county, were maliciously set on fire and destroyed.</p>
<p>The first regiment of Nottinghamshire Local Militia assembled here on Friday last under the command of Lieut. Col. Wright, and have remained on duty every since. It reflects infinite credit on the corps, that at so alarming a crisis there is scarcely a man absent but what can be accounted for. A Captain’s guard is mounted every night.</p>
<p>The dragoons at the barracks have been strengthened by a small detachment of the Scots’ Greys, from Lichfield.</p>
<p>On Wednesday a squadron if the 15th dragoons (hussars) arrived here from Colchester, and yesterday morning detachments of them were sent to Mansfield, and the villages in this neighbourhood, where they are for the present to be stationed.</p>
<p>Yesterday se’nnight, an express arrived from the High Sheriff of this county, for the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry to muster at Red Hill, near this town, with all possible speed, to assist in quelling the disturbances which have taken place in this neighbourhood. The troop mustered with an alacrity which does them the greatest credit, and arrived at the place appointed by half past four o’clock in the afternoon, where they halted and formed into line. There appearing no disposition to riot that night, and the Bunny troop being upon the ground, they returned to Southwall until further orders, which arrived on Saturday at noon, for their return home. They mustered eighty-three strong.</p>
<p>We are authorised to state, in contradiction to the assertion in the <em>Review</em> of last week, that instead of nearly 300 of the mob, which proceeded from Arnold to Sutton in Ashfield, being armed with fire-arms, there were not more than 20 that had weapons of that description.</p>

<p>Seventy miles or so to the north, an editorial comment in the <em>Leeds Mercury</em> spoke out against the violence, but also identified the war as the real cause of the situation the workers’ found themselves in.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 23 November 1811</p>
<p>Editorial in the Leeds Mercury</p>
<p>We are more concerned than surprised to find, that a Spirit of Riot and Insubordination has broken out in the county of Nottingham amongst the suffering Manufacturers. As it frequently happens on such occasions, the cause of the distress of these unfortunate people is mistaken; they imagine, it seems, that the low rate of wages and the scarcity of work arise from some improvement in the Stocking weaving Frames, and their vengeance is directed against the owners of these inoffensive implements of labour; but they ought to be informed that the real cause of the evils of which they so loudly and justly complain, is the long continuance of a heart-sickening war, without visible object, and apparently without end, and which has in its consequences damied up all the regular outlets of trade; and if instead of sacking the workshops of their employers, who are in general deep participators in the sufferings of the labouring classes, they would unite with the other manufacturers throughout the kingdom in petitioning the proper authorities, first to inform them what it is we are fighting for; and secondly, if the object does not justify the sacrifices, to put a stop to the horrors and miseries of this contest, they would act much more wisely and have a much better chance of seeing an end of their grievances, than by their present lawless and senseless proceedings. We do most sincerely commisserate their situation, but we utterly condemn the means by which they seek to obtain redress.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the that same edition of the paper, we see the same report that had previously appeared in the <em>Morning Post</em> at the start of the week, although in this case the report appears to be credited to a correspondent from Nottingham, who had perhaps sent the same letter to the <em>Morning Post</em>?</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 23 November 1811
RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM</p>
<p>For some time past the Wholesale Hosiers, who have Stocking-weaving Establishments in the county of Nottingham, have been obliged to curtail their hands; this produced considerable discontent among the workmen. Their riotous spirit was, however, increased by the trade having brought into use a certain wide frame for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, which, was a considerable saving in manual labour, leading still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday se’nnight last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinity of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as used particular frames.</p>
<p>A letter dated Nottingham, the 14th inst. communicates, that the late hands in particular were in a very distressed situation, and under the necessity of applying for parochial relief. A master weaver, at Bullwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday, armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames. The master would agree to neither, and was immediately fired upon ;- several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life he was in the act of <em>tearing</em> down the window-shutters to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength. They broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death had they not escaped by a back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed every thing that would burn.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to Maltby and Brewett, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they took to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the street.</p>
<p>Other letters state, that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob belonged to Messrs. Watson and Nelson, and produced 24 dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Tuesday, the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages there; and that evening they destroyed the frames of the principal weavers.</p>
<p>On the Wednesday morning, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill.— Having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, they grew bolder, and changed the frame-breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide-frames, millers, corn-dealers, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the <em>posse comitatis</em>, and the First and Second Regiments of Local Militia, an a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three on Friday morning.</p>
<p>All Thursday was employed in assembling together the Militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriff; during this time the mob were enabled to carry on their depredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town was left for a moment unprotected they would make a sudden attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.</p>
<p>On Friday morning intelligence was received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberley, because they were worked by women.</p>
<p>Many persons concerned in these proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed.</p>
<p>The High Sheriff, with the advice of the County Magistrates, has called in the Home Pierrepoint, and Bunny troops of Yeomanry Cavalry, whose services, with a detachment of the 4th Dragoons from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the First Regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry are in readiness to act. The Magistrates are every where at their posts. Some hundreds of special Constables have been sworn in.</p>
<p>On Thursday the body of <em>John Westley</em> a native of Leicester, the man who was shot in Sunday night at Bulwell, was removed to Arnold for interment, where he has resided for about twelve years; and where he has left two orphans, one five and the other three years of age, to bewail his untimely end: their mother having been dead some time. In the afternoon the funeral took place, and the scene was truly awful. The High Sheriff, the Under Sheriff, and about half a dozen Magistrates were on the spot, attended by a <em>posse</em> of Constables, and about thirty mounted Dragoons, who all proceeded with the funeral to the church-yard; but before the body was removed the Riot Act was read in several parts of the town. From seven hundred to a thousand persons attended on the occasion: the corpse was preceded by a number of the deceased’s former club mates, bearing black wands, decked with knots of crape,—Sorrow seemed to have seated itself upon every brow, and a solemn silence, still as death, was only interrupted by the trampling of the multitude, the bell’s heavy knoll, and a band of music playing a solemn dirge, accompanied at distant intervals by the beating of a bass drum !! About the time that the corpse was lowering into the grave, the High Sheriff proclaimed that an hour had elapsed since the reading of the Riot Act, and informed the multitude, that those who did not instantly disperse, should be taken into custody as rioters; and two were actually seized who did not immediately obey, but we believe, were shortly set at liberty; and the whole concourse quietly disbursed. Many more we understand were wounded in the various conflicts, and reports have stated several others to have lost their lives, but which reports, we hope are unfounded.</p>
<p>The most recent accounts from Nottingham left that town and neighbourhood free from tumult, in consequence of the strong military force assembled in that quarter. The workmen still, however, urge their complaints and what they call their rights. At a late meeting, held at the sign of the Sir Isaac Newton, the frame-work knitters came to several resolutions: among others, that their earnings as frame-knitters were inferior to those of any other class of mechanics: that the present grievances were as much to be attributed to the <em>irresolute</em> conduct in themselves, in not standing forward for the rights of the trade, as to an imposing principle on the part of their employers; and that they would resist impositions in future. On the 18th inst. another meeting was to take place, but we have not learnt the result.</p>
</div>
<p>Although there had been hopes that the outbreaks of violence had subsided, the attacks resumed on the weekend of November 23rd/24th, 1811.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Renewed acts of aggression, November 1811</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18111129/047/0004">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18111129/047/0004</a>
Nottingham Review - Friday 29 November 1811</p>
<p>We stated a hope in our last, that the violence exercised in this neighbourhood in the breaking of stocking frames, was about subsiding, but in that respect we have been deceived; and we have now again the painful duty to perform, of recording renewed acts of aggression. And though from the various rumours which are daily coming to our ears, it is impossible to pledge ourselves for the critical exactness of our narrative, yet we believe the following will be pretty near the truth, respecting the riotous occurrences of the week:—</p>
<p>On Saturday night, one frame was broken at Ilkiston, the first town on the verge of Derbyshire from hence; but, from both coercive and conciliatory measures being resorted to, we believe the mischief has been stopped; for we have not heard of any acts of aggression being committed there since. On the same night, one frame was broken, in an otherwise empty house, in Cyprus-street, Nottingham; it being the first instance of the kind in this place for many years. Five others in York-street, and one on Mount East, were broken on Monday night, notwithstanding a party of special constables parade the streets every night. In consequence of these acts of outrage, and applications being made for protection by several persons who considered their property in danger, the Mayor and Aldermen issued out a spirited handbill, stating that they had ordered a number of constables to be in constant readiness at the Police office, for the immediate protection of any of the inhabitants that applied; since which time, no outrages have been committed in the town. In the neighbourhood, however, this has not been the case; for, at Carlton, one frame was broken Wednesday night, and many others prevented from sharing the same fate, by the timely appearance of a party of dragoons. At Chilwell, one was broken and the woodwork burnt on Monday morning: and report states, that several have been destroyed, in course of the week, at Hucknall Torkard, Bulwell, Dob Park, Eastwood, &amp;c. But Basford has been the principal scene of action; for, notwithstanding the presence of both the civil and military powers, thirty one frames were destroyed on Sunday night, twenty on Monday night, thirteen on Tuesday night, and six on Wednesday night; and at noon on the latter day, one was broken near Red Hill, as it was coming under an escort of dragoons from Arnold to Nottingham, the soldiers, avoided proceeding to extremities, not having the power to obstruct the rioters in their determined purpose.</p>
<p>An intelligent and respectable correspondent at Basford has favored us with the following circumstances, and desires a place for them in our home news, as illustrative of the temper and disposition of the rioters:—</p>
<p>“One house that they went into, they had much trouble to obtain a light; and, while rummaging a cupboard for something with which to procure one, they discovered some plate and other valuables; but, having obtained a bit of paper, they shut to the cupboard door, nor touched any thing in the house but the frames, which were the object of their vengeance. In another house it was well understood, that from fifty to seventy golden guineas were kept by the master; but, having exercised their wrath upon the obnoxious IRON, they left the GOLD in quiet possession of the owner. At another house, the master offered them a considerable portion of money if they would spare the frames; but their answer was, that they wanted not his money, but the destruction of those instruments which prevented them from obtaining a livelihood in an honest manner. One poor man begged of the rioters to spare two frames that had been the fruit of his industry for many years: his request was granted.”</p>
<p>In the course of the week several persons have been brought in by the soldiers, on suspicion of being concerned in the breaking of frames; they were all liberated except one, and he is not committed.</p>
<p>The Nottingham Local Militia, under the command of Lientenant-Colonel Wright, was disembodied on Wednesday last; and we are happy to state, that the conduct of the men, while on duty, has been such as to merit the approbation both of their officers and the inhabitants of the town at large. On their departure, the military duty of the town, which is considered indispensible at the present moment, was performed by the Recruiting Staff, by order of Colonel Grey, the Commander of the District, until relieved by a division of the Southwell Local Militia, under the command of Captain Taylor, who marched in here on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>We are likewise happy in having to, state, that several of our hosiers have given notice to their workmen, that they will not have any more CUT-UP goods made; while others have stated their intention of paying the usual prices for making stockings. Messrs. Lacy and Seals, Lace Manufacturers, have published a hand-bill, announcing their determination of paying, what is considered at the present time, the standard price for making net, and likewise that of taking the regular rent for frames.</p>
<p>Just before our paper was sent to press, we learnt, that four frames were last night broken at Basford, and their woodworks burnt. Five frames were also destroyed the same evening at Bobbers Mill.</p>
</div>
<p>The following week, a meeting was held at which it was declared that if the peace were restored, an accommodation would be found with the workers. Publicans would also be required to shut up shop by 10pm, meaning that if you were out later than that, you were obviously up to no good…</p>

<p>Nottingham Journal - Saturday 07 December 1811</p>
<p>We feel much satisfaction in being enabled to state, that the differences between the workmen and their employers, in the hosiery and lace trades, which have of late caused so much agitation in this town and neighbourhood, and occasioned the destruction of such an immense property in frames, are at length in a fair train of accommodation. On Wednesday a very numerous meeting of the hosiers and lace manufacturers took place, when it was resolved, that as soon as “it shall be clearly manifested that the peace of the county and town is restored, the trade in general are willing and desirous to receive and consider proposals from their workmen, for the purpose of removing any grievances which may appear to exist.” A notification to this effect was immediately made by the issuing of hand-bills, and ordered, for the better information of the public, to be publicly advertised. This declaration, we most ardently hope, will be received by the workmen as a satisfactory pledge that every thing will be done, consistent with reason, in their favour, and that the mischievous proceedings which have so long disgraced this neighbourhood, will be finally put a stop to.</p>
<p>The destructive intentions of the frame-breakers have considerably relaxed within the last two days; but, towards the latter end of last week, and at the beginning of this, the work of destruction seemed to assume an increased activity, notwithstanding the unremitting vigilance of the civil and military powers. On Thursday night last three frames were broken to pieces at Bobbers’ Mill; and the following night 16 others shared the same fate at Beeston, and 12 at Blidworth. On Sunday evening, at an early hour, 4 frames out of 6 were broken in a work-shop, at New Radford. Exclusive of these, 1 very valuable lace frame, said to be worth upwards of £90, belonging to a house in this town, which had not conformed with the regulation of working by the rack, has also been destroyed; and 3 others, employed by another house in the making of single press lace, have shared the same fate. We understand also, that many frames have been broken during the night at Pentridge, Heage, South Wingfield, Ikeeston, Sheepshead, &amp;c. The secrecy and precaution with which the persons engaged in these practices carry on their operations, have hitherto rendered it a matter of impossibility to take them in the fact. They go out in small parties, disguised, with their faces besmeared, and stationing centinels at the doors, accomplish their purpose without the least noise: they communicate with each other by means of a watch-word, and the firing of a pistol, or gun, is generally the signal of danger, or of retreat.</p>
<p>A party of frame-breakers, who had entered a workshop in Rutland Street, on Tuesday night last, had a very narrow escape from being taken: during the time they were engaged in their felonious purpose, a party of military came up, headed by a Magistrate, who cut off their retreat by the way they entered, when the party, seeing no other means of escape, made their way through a back window, and over the roof of an adjoining building, from whence they were seen descending into a back yard, and being closely pursued, were obliged to force their way through a house into the street.</p>
<p>The Magistrates issued an order in the early part of the week, requiring all publicans in the different towns and villages of this county, to shut up their houses by ten o’clock at night, and to give notice to the constable of the parish of all strangers that might be therein at that hour, on pain of having their licences taken from them. All persons are likewise prohibited from being out of their houses after ten o’clock at night.—A similar order has been issued by the Town Magistrates.—(<em>See adv.</em></p>
<p>Patroles of constables nightly parade the streets of this town, to prevent any infraction of the public peace.</p>
<p>The 15th light dragoons have had a most harassing and fatiguing duty to perform since their arrival; but they have conducted themselves with great humanity, and the most exemplary discipline. One troop has been sent to Loughborough.</p>
<p>The detachment of the 2d Southwell regiment of Local Militia, which marched into this town last week, has been charged with the duty of guarding the military stores, since Friday last, and has on various occasions been employed in aid of the civil power, and in guarding the property of persons threatened.</p>
<p>We are authorised to state, that the General of the District has communicated to the Commanding Officer of the 1st regiment of Nottinghamshire Local Militia, that the Commander in Chief has been pleased to express his entire approbation of the conduct of the regiment during the period of its late assembly at Nottingham, in aid of the Civil power.</p>
<p>On the 1st instant, Edward Sutton, an inhabitant of this town, was found dead in a ditch, in the parish of West Bridgford, near this place. In his coat pocket was found a gun, so constructed that the butt-end could be taken off, the more conveniently to carry it in a concealed manner, a quantity of powder and shot, an engine called a snare, for destroying game, and wire and string for the purpose of making more. It is supposed that the gun went off by accident, as his waistcoat on the left breast was much discoloured by the powder; the shot had entered the left temple, torn off a piece of the skull, and taken away part of the brains.—Verdict of the Coroner’s Jury, <em>accidental death</em>.</p>

<p>An advert in the <em>Nottigham Journal</em> helped announce the early closing hours, as well as warning that anyone who aided or abetted the frame breakers, howosoever, would be considered complicit:</p>

<p>TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM.</p>
<p>THE Magistrates, effectually to prevent the People of the Town from being liable to be confounded with those who may come from the Country to commit Outrages upon the Property of its Inhabitants, feel themselves under the Necessity of commanding, that ALL PUBLICANS shall shut up their Houses, and not permit or suffer any Guests to be, or remain therein, after TEN o’Clock at Night: And they do further direct all Persons within the Town, to keep within their Houses, and to enjoin upon the Individuals of their Families, their Servants, and Dependents, the keeping at Home after Ten o’Clock at Night, during the present Disposition to Tumult.</p>
<p>The Magistrates suppose that few Persons are ignorant, that forcibly to enter a House in the Night-Time, in order to demolish a Frame, amounts to the Crime of <em>Burglary</em>, which by Law is punishable with <em>Death</em>; but from recent Circumstances which have come to their Knowledge, they think it incumbent upon them thus publicly to declare, to all Persons employed in the Manufacture of Stockings and Lace, and entrusted with the Care of the Frames or other Property of their Employers, that in case of any such Property being destroyed in their Possession, all those Individuals who shall appear to have left their Doors open, in order to admit Persons to come therein for the avowed Purpose of destroying Frames or other Property, or who shall wilfully decline to call Assistance for preventing their Destruction, or who shall aid or assist the Persons demolishing the same in their Escape from the Civil Power, <em>will be deemed Accomplices with the principal Felons</em>, and will be proceeded against as such with the utmost Severity of the Law.</p>

<p>Although a few attacks continued, the resolution of the hosiers and lace manufacturers seems to have been deemed a success in the Nottingham area, although new outbreaks of violence in the surrounding counties was noted. Several committals were also recorded.</p>

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 December 1811</p>
<p>Nottingham, Friday, Dec. 13.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Since the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers held on the 4th inst. the excesses of the frame-breakers have been considerably more limited, and every thing has again assumed the appearance of returning tranquillity in the vicinity of this town. We have heard of only three instances of the destruction of frames since our last, viz. 6 at Bullwell, and 4 at Arnold, on Saturday night last; and at Burton Joyce, on Wednesday night. No violence whatever, we are happy to say, has been offered to the property of the Hosiers, in this town, during the last ten days.— Another meeting of the gentlemen concerned in the manufacture of Hosiery and Lace, took place this morning, at Thursland Hall, which was very numerously attended. The result of the meeting had not transpired when this paper was put to press.</p>
<p>We understand that two stacks (one of hay, and another of seeds), the property of Mr. Pepper, miller, were maliciously set on fire last night, in the parish of Basford.</p>
<p>The Royal Berkshire regiment of Militia, commanded by Lieut. Col. Ravenshaw, arrived here, on Sunday last, in waggons, from Ipswich. The march of this regiment was hastened by some unfounded intelligence received on the road relative to the riotous excesses committed in this town, and in consequence, waggons were put in requisition for the speedy conveyance of the troops, who performed a journey of 150 miles in six days. Detachments of the regiment have, since been sent out to the different villages, which have been the principal scenes of outrage, and where the most apprehension was entertained from the visits of the rioters.</p>
<p>The Southwell Local Militia , having been relieved from duty by the arrival of the Berkshire, returned home on Tuesday, and were dismissed.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Royal Horse Guards (Blue), the South Lincoln Militia, and another regiment, are under orders for this place.</p>
<p>It appears, that the disposition to tumult and violence, which first broke out in this neighbourhood, has extended into various parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire, where private animosity has been gratified to a great extent, by the destruction of frames, the property of various houses.</p>
<p>Last week a number of people assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner, at Garendon Park, near Loughborough, the paling and fences of which they pulled down and burnt, and committed other damage.—A reinforcement of hussars was sent for express to this town from Loughborough on Sunday last, who set out with all possible speed. Their presence has had the effect of intimidating the rioters, and all is again quiet.</p>
<p>The lovers of the fine arts will regret to hear, that among other wanton devastations committed by the rioters in Garendon Park, they broke open the ?? Temple, erected there by Ambrose Phillips, Esq. early in the last century, and destroyed the fine Statue of Venus, then brought by him, at a considerable expense, from Rome.</p>
<p>The Bunny Volunteer Troop of Cavalry, commanded by Capt. Boultbee, has been stationed at Sutton in Ashfield the last eight days. A correspondent observes, that no men ever conducted themselves with greater propriety, as soldiers and gentlemen, than they have done; and when their departure was announced, it was received with real regret by the major part of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>On Wednesday last, W.S. Parkes, and George Shaw, were committed to the gaol of this town, by Edward Swann and Wright Coldham, Gentlemen, Aldermen, to take their trials at the next Assizes, on a charge of entering by force into a dwelling-house, situate in the parish of St. Mary, in this town, on the night of the 25th day of November last, and therein feloniously breaking five stocking frames, contrary to the form of the Statute in that case made and provided.—The same day also, John Ingham was committed to the town gaol, by the above Magistrates, charged on the oaths of Rupert Renshaw, and others, with feloniously writing, or causing to be written, and sending on the 13th day of November last, a letter, signed with a fictitious name, addressed to Wm. Nunn and Co. of this town, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and to injure his person, and the person of Thomas Clarke, for not complying with certain demands, claims, and pretences of him the said John Ingham, and of certain other workmen of him the said Wm. Nunn, contrary to the form of the Statute in that case made and provided.</p>
<p>Committed to the county gaol, on Saturday last, by John Need, Esquire, George Paley, charged upon the oaths of Joseph Smithhurst and others, with feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously breaking and destroying, on the 13th of November last, at Sutton in Ashfield, in this county, a certain frame used in the making of framework-knitted pieces, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton in Ashfield aforesaid.</p>
</div>
<p>The same edition of the <em>Nottingham Journal</em> also recorded a series of attacks in Derbyshire. Two visits to a certain Mr. B. Topham of Pentridge are also recorded, and his encounters with the miscreants are surely worth a story.</p>

<p>DERBY Dec. 11. It is with extreme regret we state to our readers that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in Nottinghamshire, have extended into our own county. We understand that the town of Ilkeston, and the villages of Makeney, Heage, Holbrook, Crich, &amp;c., have suffered considerably from the visits of the Frame-Breakers, the particulars of which we have not been able to learn, but are informed, from the best authority, that frames of all descriptions have been destroyed, without discrimination. From the following account, which we have received from a correspondent, it appears that at Pentrich and the neighbourhood, their proceedings have been most destructive: soon after midnight, on the 1st instant, the Frame-Breakers, armed with weapons, arrived at Pentrich, and proceeded to the house of Mr B. Topham; knocking at the door, they demanded the key of his workshop, and a light. On opening the door, they presented three guns at him, threatening to blow his brains out if he did not comply with their demands: he told them he had no frames of the description they were in search of (for cut-up work), nor were there any in the town; and having somewhat appeased them by conciliatory language, they left his house, one of them cursing the man who had sent them thither. After going to a few more shops in the village, they departed, without doing any mischief, but threatening to return some future night and demolish those frames that were worked at an under price, or by those persons who are termed <em>Colts</em>. Accordingly, on the following evening, the neighbourhood was again visited by them, but on finding that the prices had been raised, they were satisfied without breaking any frames, excepting one at Oakenthorpe, one at South Wingfield Park, and one at Wessington. On Saturday night the seventh, about the hour of twelve, with most destructive purpose they came again to Pentrich, and literally broke into shivers ten stocking frames, and also two lace frames, notwithstanding full proces have been given. The two lace frames were worked by Mr. Topham, who, as the mob were entering his shop, chanced to be at a short distance from his house, on his return from Nottingham, and learning what was going forward, with much presence of mind ran to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and begain to ring the bells; on hearing which the rioters were alarmed and precipitately retreated. They afterwards demolished a frame a short distance from the village, and proceeded to Swanwick, where they broke three frames, and also two at Riddings, both near Alfreton. At Ilkeston, about thirty frames have been injured in the course of the week.</p>
<p>The most prompt and vigilant measures have been adopted by the Magistrates for the county to suppress these alarming proceedings, and restore the public tranquility, which we trust will be speedily effected.— On Monday, the Derby and Chaddesden Troops of Yeomanry Cavalry were ordered to assemble here on duty, and mustered in the evening with the greatest alacrity; and yesterday they were joined by the Radborne troop. They have been engaged in the whole of the last nights in different divisions, protecting the neighbouring villages and places where the most apprehension was entertained. The Derby and Chaddesden troops were relieved from duty this afternoon, by the arrival of a troop of Scots Greys from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here until further orders. —<em>Derby Mercury</em>.</p>

<p>As the mischief stepped up in Derbyshire, a delegation had been sent to London, perhaps in recognition that the current troubles could not be properly addressed by purely local measures.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">A deputation to London, December 1811</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18111213/032/0004">https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18111213/032/0004</a>
Nottingham Review - Friday 13 December 1811</p>
<p>The alarm occasioned by the insurrectional conduct of the frame-breakers, had taken such deep-root in the minds of the manufacturers, that on Friday last, a deputation of them arrived in London, to lay the state of the town and county before government, in consequence whereof, a magistrate from Bow-street and several police officers, appeared in this town a few days after; but we have not heard of any additional activity being displayed on that account, as indeed that would almost seem impossible; the magistrates both of the town and county having exerted every nerve of the civil authority previous to the arrival of the watchful strangers. And we have every reason to believe, that the conciliatory measures proposed by the manufacturers, in inviting the workmen to lay their compaints before them, <em>after the peace of the town and the county should have been restored</em>, have had a greater effect in allaying the commotions than any measures adopted by the civil and military authorities could have produced. Indeed, so cautious, so determined, and so systematic in their operations were the rioters become, that the exertions both of the soldiers (whose orderly conduct and clemency have excited general admiration) and the civil power were almost unavailing.</p>
<p>In our own immediate vicinity, the only mischief we have heard of being done, since our last, is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. The mischief has been more extensive in Derbyshire, for, on Friday night last, seven frames were broken at Holbrook, and on Saturday night, at Pentridge and its neighbourhood, eighteen were broken; and, though we have not learnt the number, we have been informed that several were destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason which has been publicly circulated, for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that some one hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that the destructive visit may to deter him from so doing. Among the number, two lace frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own was slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of him going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Berkshire militia arrived in this town, in twenty-four waggons, on their rout from Ipswich, and on their arrival, they neither found the town half burnt down, nor any symptoms thereof, the local militia driven away by the rioters, nor the Mayor and fifteen of the hussars murdered in the streets, as they had been informed on the road. Such an active agent is <em>rumour</em>, that if <em>caution</em> does not attend at his heels, he would soon cause a belief that half the kingdom was in flames. As a precautionary measure, the Berkshire militia are principally stationed in the neighbouring villages; and the Southwell locals have been dismissed to their respective homes, with an excellent character for their good conduct. On the last mentioned day, a report was spread here, that the flame of discord was making rapid advances at Loughborough; and a troop of hussars were summoned from hearing divine service in one of our churches, and immediately dispatched to that town; they, however, and the public, were agreeably disappointed, for Loughborough and its neighbourhood were in peace. A considerable quantity of posts and rails, belonging to a gentleman in that vicinity, had been set fire to a night or two before, but even the supposed motive for the commission of such a daring outrage, we have not been made acquainted with.</p>
<p>Measures of precaution for the protection of property continue to be taken both in this town and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton’s hall in particular, where the arms belonging to the late Wollaton and Lenton Volunteers are deposited, has been protected by a strong guard for seventeen successive nights, for fear those arms should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal for assistance from our barracks, in case of an alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself: the workmen in thee various branches of the framework-knitting trade, are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter, we are happy to hear, lend a favorable ear to such solicitations, and we understand are this day holding a meeting at the Exchange-Hall, to take the business into consideration; and the magistrates laudably interest themselves in furthering the work of conciliation.</p>
<p>After flattering ourselves with these favorable. appearances, it is doubly painful to have to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw, and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, Flour-seller, in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part was saved.</p>
<p>We are credibly informed, that yesterday afternoon, a frame was broken at Burton, in this county. The depredators escaped detection, though there are parties both of horse and foot soldiers in the village.</p>
<p>At the moment our paper was going to press, a meeting of an extraordinary nature was sitting at the Shire Hall, as we understand, for the purpose of taking into consideration the alarming state of the county, of hearing complaints, and examining into means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority. There were present, His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the County), Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &amp;c. and the Magistracy of the County.</p>
<p>Committed on Wednesday the 11th instant, for trial at the Assizes, by Edward Swann and Wright Coldham, Gentlemen, Aldermen, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, Lace-manufacturer, upon the oaths of Rupert Renshaw and others, with feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed with a ficticious name, viz. “<em>Ned Lud and Co.</em>” and directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. Park-street, Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and injure his person, and the person of Thomas Clarke, a person concerned in such manufacture.</p>
<p>And on the same day, by the same Magistrates, Wiliam Parkes, and George Shaw, upon the oath of Joseph Allen and others, with entering a dwelling house in this town, on the 25th of November, and breaking five stocking frames contrary to Statute.</p>
<p>In addition to the military force now stationed here, we understand that two troops of the Oxford Blues, commanded by Captain Fenwick, are on their march from Reading to this town, by forced marches.</p>
</div>
<p>Communications were also starting to appear in the national (which is to say, London) press with letters from correspondents passing on the news previously reported in the regional papers.</p>

Globe - Monday 16 December 1811</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM RIOTS</p>
<p>We have received letters and papers from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester, our extracts from which shew, that the disturbances which first broke out in the county of Nottingham, are extending with alarming rapidity to the neighbouring counties. Nottingham, where we were led to believe that all disputes between the manufacturers and their employers were in a train of accommodation, the turbulent spirit of the rioters, encouraged long impunity, is manifested in the acts of incendiaries; in the county of Derby, the number of frames broken within the last eight days exceed 110; and in Leicester, we fear, we shall soon have to record similar acts of violence. Government, we understand, wished in the instance to leave the suppression’of these disturbances to the magistracy, who, with the military, have, throughout, been alike active and indefatigable; but it must be evident that the rioters are too well organised, act too systematically, and receive too correct information, to be suppressed without other aids.</p>
<p>LEICESTER, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. Rumours are in circulation here, that a party of frame-breakers have visited one or two villages in our vicinity: but the extent of the damage, or whether any, is not known. Our yeomanry have been on duty for some days past. The King’s Guards (Blues) arrived yesterday morning; and the Cumberland Militia have been ordered thither from Cambridge.</p>
<p>DERBY, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. It is with extreme regret we state, that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in a neighbouring county, have broken out here with destructive violence: At Holbrook, Crich, Heage, and Pentridge, not fewer than between 40 and 50 frames, of all descriptions, have been broken since Saturday last. A party of these deluded men visited Pentridge thrice in one night (the 1st inst.) not finding the frames they were in search of at Mr. Topham’s, they departed without doing any mischief, but giving caution to the people not work at an under price, nor encourage colts among them, threatening otherwise they would return and demolish their frames. On the second visit they were pacified at finding that the prices had been raised, and contented themselves with demolishing three frames at Oakerthorpe, &amp;c. On Saturday night they returned and broke twelve frames, notwithstanding full prices having been given. Two of the lace frames belonged to Mr. Topham, who, not being at home on their arrival, but learning what was going forward, ran with great presence of mind to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells; hearing which the rioters were alarmed, and precipitateiy retired. They afterwards demolished several frames at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley. At Ilkeston about 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week. The reason which has been circulated for the frame breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that one hosier had hitimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames to the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Measures have been adopted to prevent arms falling into the hands of the rioters, and the Derby and Chadderton yeomanry cavalry have been called out. A troop of Scots Greys has also arrived from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here. The military are authorised to act in case of falling in with the rioters.</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM, FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DEC. 13. We had flattered ourselves that the publication of the Resolution agreed to at a Meeting of the Hoseirs and Lace Manufacturers would have caused the frame-breakera to suspend their destructive proceedings throughout the county; but though no act of violence has occurred in this town for the last ten days, they have not ceased elsewhere. At Bulwell and Arnold ten frames wore broken on Saturday Sunday, and two at Baston Joyce on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Three o’clock. —After flattering ourselves with the hopes of approaching tranquillity, it is doubly painful to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, flour-seller in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latter only a small part was saved.—At this moment an extraordinary meeting is sitting at the Shire Hall, consisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the county) Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warres, Sir T. W. White, and the Magistrates, to take into consideration the alarming and destructive state of the county, to receive informations, and to endeavour to ascertain the means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority.</p>

Star (London) - Monday 16 December 1811
NOTTINGHAM RIOTS</p>
<p>The latest accounts received from Nottingham state, that in the immediate vicinity, the only mischief recently done is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. It has been more extensive in Derbyshire; for on Saturday se’nnight, near Pentridge, 18 frames were broken and several destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason publicly circulated for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge is, that some hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that their visit was to deter him. Two lace-frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of his going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.</p>
<p>Precautions for the protection of property continue both at Nottingham and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton’s Hall, where arms are deposited has been guarded for 17 successive nights, lest they should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal, in case of alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself; the Workmen in the frame-work knitting-trade are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter lend a favourable ear to such solicitations, and we understand on Friday held a meeting at the Exchange-hall, on the subject.—After such favourable appearances, it is painful to record new aggressions . Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, were on Friday night set fire to at Basford, the gormer entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part saved.</p>
<p>We are informed, that on Thursday a frame was broken at Burton. The depredators escaped deteetion, though horse and foot soldiers were in the village.</p>
<p>An extraordinary meeting sat at the Shire Hall on Friday, to consider the state of the country, to hear complaints, and to examine into the means by which the rioters support themselves. There were present the Duke of Newcastle, Viscount Newark, Sir J. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &amp;c., and the Magistracy of the county.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 11th inst. was committed for trial at the Assizes, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, lace manufacturer, for feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed “Ned Lud and Co.” directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. threatening break and destroy their frames, and injure his person and that of T. Clarke, concerned in such manufacture. The appearance of the rioters was feared at Leicester.</p>
</div>
<p>To the north as well, Edward Baines, of the <em>Leeds Mercury</em>, was maintaining a watching brief on the affairs to the south, and trying to place the events into some sort of historical context.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 December 1811</p>
<p>Nottingham, Dec. 12- The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has no parallel in history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. Day after day have the Magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil powers, and called in additional aid of the military; but hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail; a mysterious organization has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. — The rioters appear suddenly, in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of who, being whomsoever he may, is stiled <em>General Ludd</em>, and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of the Monarch. Indeed it is well understood, that disobedience to his commands is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organized band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already being inflicted, by the burning of haystacks, &amp;c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and so few of the depredators apprehended.</p>
<p>The following article, on the same subject, is from the <em>Statesman</em> Newspaper, and is of so alarming a complexion as to induce a hope that there is some degree of exaggeration:—</p>
<p><em>December 15</em>— There are 20,000 stocking-makers out of employment. Six regiments of soldiers from different parts of the country have been sent into this town; and 300 new constables have been sworn in to keep the peace. But all this is of no avail as the practice of setting fire to corn and hay stacks, and breaking open houses still continues. Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken, which cost £140 each; from twenty to thirty of them are destroyed in a night. The whole country, for twenty miles around, is full of these ruinous proceedings, nor can they be checked, Nottingham gaol is full of debtors; and the country is equally distressed. no trade; no money. This has been the case for two months. This town is now a garrison, and strictly under martial law. God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin.</p>
<p>Later accounts down to the 18th inst. state that no advantage has resulted from the expected Meeting of the manufacturers, but that the parties broke up without coming to any decision.</p>
</div>
<p>But finally, with Christmas approaching, it seems as if the Magistrates and their military support were starting to make some headway in making arrests.</p>

Stamford Mercury - Friday 20 December 1811</p>
<p>THE RlOTS.— Notwithstanding the extreme vigilance of the civil and military powers in Nottingham and its neighbourhood, depredations (though we are happy to say in a lesser degree) still continue to be committed.— The utmost measures of precaution, security, and conciliation are taken, and we anxiously look forward to a speedy adjustment of the existing misunderstanding.</p>
<p>On Saturday night a man was escorted to Leicester goal (<em>sic</em>) by a party of light horse, for breaking a stocking frame in the neighbourhood of Loughborough; — since that time no fresh outrages have been committed in Leicestershire.</p>
<p>Committals to Nottingham town gaol:— W. S. Parkes, and George Shaw, to take their trials at the next assizes, on a charge of entering by force into a dwelling-house, situate in the parish of St. Mary, Nottingham, on the night of the 25th day of November last, and therein feloniously breaking five stocking-frames; —also John Ingham, charged on the oaths of Rupert Renshaw, and others, with feloniously writing, or causing to be written, and sending, on the 13th day of November last, a letter, signed with a fictitious name, addressed to Nunn and Co. of Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and to injure his person, and the person of Thos. Clarke, for not complying with certain demands, claims, and pretences of him the said John Ingham, and of certain other workmen of him the said Nunn.— Committed the county gaol:— George Paley, charged upon the oaths of Joseph Smithhurst, and others, with feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously breaking and destroying, on the 19th of November last, at Sutton in Ashfield, a certain frame used in the making of frame-work-knitted pieces, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton in Ashfield aforesaid.</p>
