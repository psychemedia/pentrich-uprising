THE KING

against

James Haigh, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, James Brook, John Brook, Thomas Brook, John Walker, and John Hirst.

The eight prisoners (together with George Mellor, William Thorpe, and Thomas Smith, who were executed yesterday) were indicted; for that they, together with others unknown, were, on the 11th of April last, tumultuously assembled, and being so assembled did begin to demolish a certain mill of William Cartwright, at Liversedge, in the county of York.

The prisoners having been arraigned, and severally pleaded not guilty, the indictment was opened by Mr. Richardson.

*Mr. Park*.—May it please your lordships; gentlemen of the jury; we are now assembled to try a different species of offence, from either that of yesterday, or those of the preceding days. Gentlemen, this case it one of those, to which allusion has been made; it is connected with the system that has been prevailing in the country, and is one almost of the first of the desperate attacks that were made in this country, before that unfortunate event which deprived Mr. Horsfall of life. And you will find in the course of this, as indeed appeared in the course of that trial, that the irritation produced in the minds of the unfortunate persons who have suffered death for that offence, by what passed at Mr. Cartwright's mill, probably led to that lamentable event. The day that is material for your consideration here, is Saturday the eleventh of April 1812.

The act of parliament upon which the prisoners stand indicted, I will first state to you. It was passed in the 9th year of his present majesty's reign, cap. 29. intituled, "An Act for the more effectual punishment of such persons as shall demolish or pull down, burn, or otherwise destroy or spoil, any mill or mills." I need not trouble you with any further statement of the title of it. It goes on to enact, "That if any person or persons, unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled together, to the disturbance of the public peace, shall unlawfully and with force demolish or pull down or begin to demolish or pull down any wind-saw-mill of other wind-mill, or any water-mill or other mill, which shall have been or shall be erected, or any of the works thereto respectively belonging, that then every such demolishing or pulling down, or beginning to demolish or pull down, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of clergy." This is the law upon which these men stand indicted.

It is well known, that in the manufacturing part of the West Riding of this county, there have been various implements of machine introduced, and wisely introduced, for the purpose of expediting our manufactures, and bringing them to better use. The advantages to the labourers themselves, if they would have given themselves the patience to understand the thing, would have convinced them of the great utility of such machinery; but unfortunately, they took a different course, and would not stay to consider the great mischiefs they would bring on themselves, not only if punishment followed, but the absolute poverty, misery and distress which the destruction of those mills, where such machinery was used, must bring on all the unfortunate persons who were occupied in them. If they had so considered, I think that common prudence independently of moral obligation, would have prevented their doing what has been done. For if only this devastation, which was intended for Mr. Cartwright's mill, had been effected, a number of families must have been thereby thrown out of bread, at least for a considerable time, till he could erect new works. It must, therefore, have produced dreadful distress. But that argument did not prevail with these misguided persons; and for a considerable period of time, these deluded, foolish, ignorant, and wicked men, were going round the country, destroying all the obnoxious machinery, and stealing arms; so that previously to the 11th of April, they had collected a considerable quantity of gunpowder, guns, pistols and other

Mr. Cartwright, whose mill, called Rawfolds mill, was so attacked on the 11th of April, had had previous notice, that among those people he had been denounced, on account of his employing the most improved machinery. In consequence of which notice, this gentleman slept in his mill for upwards of six weeks before the 11th of April, deserting his family (for his dwelling-house was elsewhere); and not only that, but he had beds prepared for five military, and four of his own workmen. He prepared for his defence, as every prudent man should do; and I have only to lament, that the same spirit Mr. Cartwright displayed, was not displayed by other gentlemen, whose property was threatened. Probably if that spirit had been manifested, their lordships and you would not have been troubled on the present occasion. I will not go through all that he did with his mill. It seemed almost impossible for any, but a most active military force, to destroy the works he erected there. But there is one thing I must mention, because it affords almost decisive evidence against one of the unfortunate men now at the bar. It seems the different floors (I think there were three above the ground floor) were laid with flags of a considerable size, in a row, which were raised obliquely, so as to make loopholes; so that if any man should attack the lower windows of the manufactory with hatchets and hammers, those within might fire down upon them; and Mr. Cartwright furnished himself with muskets and gunpowder for that purpose.

On the 11th of April (for I will now state the facts, applying them afterwards to the men at the bar): Mr. Cartwright will state that he had retired to bed soon after twelve, having previously ascertained that his watchmen were on their posts; two of whom were set on the outside, to give notice of the approach of an enemy; but, like many more of our watchmen, they were surprised, and were actually seized, before any alarm could be given by them. About twenty-five minutes before one, as well as he could ascertain the time, a large dog, which was chained on the ground floor, began to bark furiously. This gentleman, whose feelings were all alive, immediately jumped out of bed, and flew to the stairs; but while he was doing so, being still in his shirt, he was astonished by an immediate heavy fire of musketry poured into his upper windows, and violent hammering at the door next to the road; for you will find by the description, that this mill had a pond on one side, so that it was to a certain degree protected. Mr. Cartwright and his men had piled their arms the night before; he immediately rushed towards them, and met his own men and the soldiers, without any covering but their shirts, having just jumped out of bed. By his orders they commenced a heavy firing from within the mill, and this they continued, as will be proved to you, upwards of twenty minutes. The mob, during that time kept up their fire also; and you will find that it consisted of more than an hundred persons. They broke all the windows, many of the window frames, and one of the doors, calling out, with the most horrible imprecations (which I shall not repeat) "Bang up, lads!—Are you within, lads? —Damn them, keep close." Mr. Cartwright had placed an alarm bell at the top of his building; this was rung with considerable force, till the bell-rope broke. The mob, upon hearing it ring, called out, "Damn it, silence that bell." But two of Cartwright's men went up, and rang the bell, by turns firing and ringing. At length, the firing still continuing from within, and probably the ammunition of the mob running short, the assailants began to slacken fire, and at last it entirely ceased, except that one man fired a single shot at the close. Mr. Cartwright heard the people go off towards Huddersfield, and, when their clamour subsided, was able to hear the groans of some who were left behind wounded, but he was afraid of going out, lest it should be said that he had murdered them. It was so dark that nothing could be distinguished by sight. But when assistance came, Mr. Cartwright and his men went out, and found a great number of malls, hammers, muskets and so on, left on the road to Huddersfield. They also found two men, who were too badly wounded to escape, and who afterwards unfortunately died, upon whom the coroner's jury sat, and found a verdict (as they were bound to do) of justifiable homicide.

Now, gentlemen, the way in which I propose to fix the prisoners at the bar, some of them, is this. You will observe what extreme difficulty there must be in such a case as the present. Here is an attack made, at which no persons can of course be present, that are not themselves criminal, except the gentleman who is the object of attack; and he, from his situation, could not know any single individual who was present. I shall call before you no less than three of the persons who were at that attack; two of those three persons have already gone through the ordeal of an examination here; they have been examined, and with strict and proper strictness cross-examined by my learned friends, who were of counsel for those prisoners against whom they were called. I shall call before you also a person, who has likewise been examined before, not an accomplice, though not free from blame, because he did not communicate facts within his knowledge; a person of the name of Sowden. The general circumstances, to which Mr. Cartwright will speak, will be fully confirmed, or rather he will fully confirm the accomplices. I shall call before you this Sowden to confirm these men, who will prove, that a person of the name of Dickinson, who is not charged, for he has not been found, came to the manufacturory of Mr. Wood. Mr. Wood's name has unfortunately been too often mentioned, and whether he knew more than has been discovered, God and his own conscience only know; but at Mr. Wood's house it seems wonderful that all these transactions should be going on, and the master of these men know nothing about them. But Sowden will prove, that on the morning of the 11th of April, Dickinson came to Mr. Wood's, and that at that time there was a great deal of conversation. He will tell you also that there was before that a great deal of conversation with John Walker and Jonathan Dean, two of the persons at the bar, about commencing the system of framebreaking, in the same way that the breaking of stocking and lace-frames had been carried on at Nottingham; when it was proposed, that these who would not join them, should be turned out of work; and that he was asked by Mellor and Dean to join them, but that he never did. He appears to me to be one of those fanatical enthusiasts one has seen about the country; but when he was before examined, I saw nothing in his manner to entitle any one to say he was not deserving of the credit he demands. This witness has also heard Dean mention that he was one of the party. He will prove also that Dickinson distributed ammunition, when he came to the manufactory on the morning of the day that this attack took place; and it will be proved to yon, that it was settled at that time where they were to meet; that they were to meet at about eleven o'clock at night, in a field belonging to sir George Armytage, near what ia called the dumb steeple, by which is meant an obelisk in sir George's grounds. It will be proved to you that there they went. That fact the accomplices of course will prove, for nobody else can. There they assembled; and one of the unfortunate persons now no more, George Mellor, seems to have been one of the most active leaders of the body. He appears to have acted as a kind of commander in chief. They were placed in military array; they were formed into companies, and marched in platoons, thirteen in front. How many rows there were, the witness cannot tell, from the darkness of the night. The men who had muskets, marched first; the pistol-men, next; and the club-men and staff-men, and those without fire-arms, marched in the third division; the musket-company commanded by Mellor; the pistol company by Thorpe; and by whom the third company was commanded, does not appear. They marched in this body to the mill, and they there made the attack which I have already mentioned to you, and which I shall not repeat; and they went off in the way I have already told you.

Now I must apply the rule of law which is admitted, and which the learned judges have stated to you, upon the subject of accomplices, the common cases of accomplices have been those, in which a crime has been committed by perhaps two or three or four men at the utmost, and where A. B. wishing to relieve himself, might be suspected of endeavouring to throw the guilt on an innocent man. But in this particular case, which, I thank God is, and I trust will be, the last instance of the kind, the body being extremely large, it is impossible to suppose that A. B. can fix on one, two, three, or even six, from such a motive, because that would not answer his purpose, as in the common case of a crime committed by a few. The rule of law laid down by one of their lordships, the other day, was that which every lawyer heard with entire satisfaction, and to which I have no doubt every lawyer will accede. It has been usual to confirm the accomplice in some of the transactions to which he speaks; he cannot be confirmed in the main transaction, because, if he was, we should not call him as a witness, but should put him upon his trial. What is expected, is, that we should confirm him in some of the minute particulars. It is not necessary, where an accomplice is called against a greater or a less number of persons, that he should be confirmed in the facts respecting every prisoner. Mr. Baron Thompson, in his charge to a jury on Tuesday, sitting in your place, stated the law most accurately. I have the Report `[see above, p. 17.]`, and I perfectly recollect it. "It is not necessary that an accomplice should be confirmed in every circumstance the details in evidence. That would he almost a matter of impossibility; that is certainly too much to be expected, and never is required. It is quite sufficient to see, that, in some material acts, the witness, who shall have been an accomplice, is confirmed to the satisfaction of a jury; and that confirmation need not be of circumstances which go to prove that he speaks truth with respect to all the prisoners, and with respect to the share they have each taken in the transaction; for if the jury are satisfied that he speaks truth in those parts, in which they see unimpeachable evidence brought to confirm him, that is a ground for them to believe that he speaks also truly with regard to the other prisoners, as to whom there may be no confirmation." His credit is to go to you; his credit stands or falls, not by the circumstance of his being confirmed as to all the men, to whom he is speaking; but if he is confirmed as to some of the men, and you find him speaking the truth as to some, and in some of the particulars, it is a fair ground for you to believe that he speaks truth as to the others.

The accomplices will speak to all the prisoners now standing at your bar. Now, therefore, taking that for granted, I will endeavour to shew you how I can confirm these accomplices as to some of them; for I state at once in the outset, that I cannot confirm them as to circumstances concerning all. But I have been extremely careful, as far as my judgment would enable me to go, and I hope that that care will not be made use of in any way against the conduct which has been pursued. Although I did not doubt about some of the other persons, who were to have been named in the indictment, I have not allowed any to be included, against whom all the accomplices did not speak, unless where there existed other circumstances of confirmation.

I will endeavour to go through the names of the prisoners in the indictment, excluding the three first, who are not here to answer for this offence. The case of James Haigh is one, respecting which I think there can be no doubt. I told you before, in the narration of the circumstances, that there was a firing. The next morning after this affair happened, James Haigh applied to a country surgeon, for a cure for a wound in the shoulder. The surgeon asked him his name. He would not tell him. The surgeon asked him, how he came by that hurt? and he said, he had received it by having fallen in jumping down a quarry. Now I apprehend that it had no appearance of being a wound such as a man would sustain by falling into a quarry, for it went in a slanting direction, and some of the linen of the shirt was carried into the wound. The surgeon dressed it as well as he could, he sewed it up, and he gave the prisoner some salve to dress it; and Haigh went away. You will find that he never appeared at his work again, but slipped away in the night, with his master, a man of the name of Ardron (whom he can call, if he chooses) to the house of a person of the name of Culpan, thirteen miles off; they arrived at Culpan's in the dead of night, and knocked up Culpan and his wife between three and four in the morning. Culpan has but one room, and one bed for himself and his wife; and Ardron told him, "This is a poor man, a friend of mine, he wants to rest a bit,— he has had an accident with his shoulder. I wish you would let him sit here." The poor man said it was very awkward, they had but one bed; however, he and his wife got up, and gave that bed to Haigh. The prisoner afterwards went from place to place for many days, and did not return to his work; and when he was apprehended, the shirt he had on was taken off, and the magistrate kept the shirt, which will be produced to you; and, I understand, from the hole it will appear most manifestly that the wound was received in the way I have stated.

With respect to the next prisoner Jonathan Dean, I shall prove to you that he was wounded in the hand; and I shall call Sowden, who will prove that Dean was one of the persons who declared at Wood's shop, when talking about shear-breaking, that he who would not join, should be turned out of work; and that he has heard Dean admit that he was at Cartwright's attack, and received the wound in his hand through the door, while he was in the act of striking it with a hatchet. The accomplices will prove that he was wounded in the hand, and here is an admission by the man that he received that wound there; and I think it will be proved to you, independently of this,  that Dean was continually using persuasions to others to induce them to become of the same party. But in order to put that, of which we have had too much experience under the present commission, entirely out of the question, I shall read to you the examination of Dean himself, which I apprehend will be quite decisive, and that it will be your duty to find him guilty.

The next person named in the indictment is John Ogden. With respect to him the confirmation as far as I recollect, is not very considerable, but it will stand, as I before stated to you, upon the manner in which the witnesses shall tell their story. They will swear that Ogden had a sword (I believe it was the only one in the company), and that he broke it in the scabbard, and part of the scabbard will be produced. He returned from the attack with Drake and Ben. Walker, through Clifton. I shall rely upon their evidence, if they give it in such a manner as to entitle themselves to any degree of credit, confirming then in other circumstances respecting other prisoners, and leaving it to you that there is every reason to believe that they speak the truth as to these.

James Brook is the next. I have the evidence of only two as to him. I told you I had selectedthe cases to which all the three accomplices spoke; I believe only two of the accomplices will speak to this prisoner, but I have better evidence to supply the place of that third accomplice in this instance; and the very circumstance of their not all speaking to the same men, is certainly a confirmation of their testimony, for it shows it is not a made-up story. I have the evidence of a woman, who lived next door to James Brook, who had the curiosity natural to women; and her attention being excited by the outrages committed at that time in that neighbourhood, and every body being in a state of alarm, this woman the morning after the attack on this mill,

The evidence for the CroWn, and for the Prisoners, wiH be found fully stated in the following Summing-up :

. Mr. Justice Lt Blanc, Gentlemen of the Jury: This charge, the iaquiiy into whidi hat occupied the. whole of your day, is bronghi against the several prisoners at the bar, of the names of James Haigh, Jonathan Dean, Joha Ogdea, James Brook, John Brook, Thomaf Brook, John Walker, and John Hirst» eigfal in number; who stand indicted, with three other pemons, who are not now at the baiv having been convicted on a former indietmant^ of a heinous otfeiaee*

The indictment charges that they, with a ammber of other evil-disposed persons, aasembled together at Liversedge on the 11th of April, unlawfully, riotously, tumultuously and feloniously, to the disturbanee of thh public peace; and that being so assembled, they with tcwceotdawfully and feloniously didbegm tord^ •molish and ^vXi down a certain miU of. one William Cartwright,t^eia eiandiHg and beings against the king's peace : ^ that the siAalaoc^ of the charge k^ that these penoas, with a great number of others, assembled in a lio^ m8 meatier, did not demolish, but bepa to demolish, and pull down the mill of this Mr. Cartwright. AadttiafDandedapenthepaai>tive law of the eoantnr* A Ibnaer act, ^hidh may be belter known by the aame of ihe. RieC act, had far the puipoeeaf preveaangtha.iH eonee^paenoes of a number aC aviNlispased pei^ sonamBeliag..ri(»tott^.aBd Itaaad^eiady and doing mischief, made it. penil.<iB>the same manner as tins act now does with itapect to mills) for. naraoae eo. aasemhM either io. set fire to orttemeUahor pnH downahy heuees, bams, or a variety o£ otlMC thaegs which am tiiera eaaiaerated. Ia proaaes of time, as mills beeame frequently the object of the vengeance of persons tumultuously aesemblad, tlnspaxiicu]aract, which was passed iatha Wh year of the present kiag, was aaada to include miHsof,all descriptions, because it uses the expression '' wind-Baw*mill .or other windmill, or any water«mtU or other mail;'' eo dmt there is no doubt it imdndes all mills by whadi apower is aaed fa the pnrposa of working macbiaery, just in the same maaaer as it dees mills either ibr goading flour, or fa perfaming the o^ration of sawing timber; and that it makes it in the same manner peaal, to demolish oc begin to.demoliah or pidi down mit

f any de»cription, as the foimer act had made , it to begpin to demolish dwelling houses. Therefore the only question will be, whether these persons, or any of them, did assemble in a tumultuous manner, and whether they began to demolish this mill. It was not, in met, demolished, in consequence of the spirit displayed by the owner of it, and which one wishes the possessor of every house, and of erery description of property in this country, that may happen to be attacked, would display; and tlmt each would collect what force ne could, and stand forward in the defence and protection of his own property, receiving such assistance as the government and the laws of his country would afford him. It would prove the most effectual and the best way of suppress* ing all tumults and riots of this description, if at the first moment every person would maniully stand forward in the manner this gentleman did, in the defence of his property. And it appears that by piaking the best defence he and the persons in thisiaill with him could, they in (act succeeded in driving the assailants 4>ff, before thev had demolished the mill; but you will consider whether they had not begun to do it, looking to the instruments they brought with them, and the progress they made in that which they appear to have gone there with an intention of Qotng.

The first witness called, is Mr. William Cartwright, the possessor of this mill, situate mi Rawfolds, in the township of Liversedge, which he held under a lease, and which was used for the purpose of finishing cloth. He says, that a short time before the 11th of April he had entertained apprehensions that an Attack was meditatied, and was in the contemplation of some of those persons who were actuated by that very mischievous spirit which was then afloat in the country, and that it would befliade upon this mill of his at Rawfolds; that he had slept in the mill himself for six weeks before, and had armed some of his work-people, who slept in the mill with him; and in consequence of the indisposition or illness of some of his workmen, had got the assistance of a few military idso to deep with him in the mill; that he had altogether ten, five military, and five not military. That on the Saturday, which was the 11th of April, the night when this affair happened, they themselves had gone to rest soon after twelve o'clock at night; that a quarter of an hour after he had retired to rest he was alarmed by the barking of a large dog, chained within the building for the purpose of giving the alarm; that he immediately got out of bed, and on opening the door of a small apartment in which he slept, he heard a violent breaking of the windows on the ground floor, and at the same time a discharge of musketry or fire-arms at the windows of the ground and upper floors, and he heard likewise a violent hammering at one of the doors of his mill, and the voices of a number of persons at the others; that on one side of this building of his ttieve is a pool of

water, which, I suppose, works the wheel that set the machinery in motion; that upon hearing this, they all flew to their arms; that he had placed a bell upon the top of his building, for the purpose of giving an alarm, in concert with the military stationed at no great distance; and he and his people set that bett ringing, and discharged their muskets tluoii^ the loop holes of the mill, in an oblique direction with respectno the situation wlim he was standing; and that the fire was kept up by the people without, and they in return fiiM hm within. They heard the cries of the pefsaitt ea the outside, encouraging their companions who were engaged in this attack, and then he repeats the language which he heard them utter at that time, "Bang up, my lads — ^In with you— Are you in, my lads? — ^Keep dose— In with you, lads-^Damn them, kill them every " And then, "Damn that bell, get it."

referring to the bell which he was ringing in order to give the alann. All this shomrs that there were a considerable number of persons, and that they were encouraging each other in doing that which they were then about, namdy, breaking into this mill for the porpoae of destroying it. He says that die numb^ of the assailants seemed to be very considerable, bat it was in the night, and he was in the building, so that he cannot form a judgment as to their number ; th^t, judging from the nuinfacr of cartridges they had fired from within, tikis aitaf^ must have lasted as long as twen^ minntes ; and that when the fire firom the people witfaoot slackened, he heard the cries of penona who aopeared to be wounded from the nre vthich be

had kept up from within, and an attempt by the people to carry off some of them who had been wounded. He says dmt they immediately slackened thar fiie within, as diew others slackened their five without; and upon diat the people without appeared to aeparals themselves, and take different ronts, bnt both TouU leading back to Hudderafield. He says a person of the name of Cockell came i^ before he himself had opened the door so as to be able to see what was without; end upon this person coming up, probably hearing the alarm of the bell and wiiat was doasg^ ihey opened dieir doors and went out; and.he giyea an account of what-diey found on the o^lnde of the house when they went ont, that they found two men lying there who had been wounded, and whom the party had not eanied off; that these persons were taken to a pndiliohouse, to be taken oare of That when dayliQ^t came in the morning they enflBined awre partieuiariy thestate of the smO, end they found that aHdie frames and the f^Mi ef aH the windows on the ground<4eor ef ilie mffl were bRdcen to pieces, eacepi abont nine penes of glass out of diree hundred; that the doer ef the mill had been chopped with a halehet, and had received many blows with ^dntt they call malls, by which the pannels of the ddnr w»e broken and chopped, to pieces in holcBj ee diet men might nemiy ptit their beads tkrangh

So that I coUeot from lis account, that these frames fixed into the 4one work were in some instances entirely lestroyed and aawohed in, and the dooie voken in the same way, and the stone jambs n two instances broken off. This is the only nridenoe given of the ii^uiy to the mill; and he question is« whether there waa notabeginr king to demmish eome part of that which brmed the iabrio of the mill; not the breaking )f glass windows (lor- that wopild not be a be(inning to demolish^ but here was a breaking >f the frwaes of the windows; and you wiu ludge of their intent from the number that aune* ai»d the nianner in which they attacked he mill, which was each, that nothing but a ^rqus resistance would he? e prevented the (vhole from being demolished^

James Sandys, who was one of Mr. Cartwright's men, says, that the next morning he bundaoH^of the malls and hatchets, which lare been produced and laid upon the table; >>>? hat he found one of the hammers, and a ftkmmer-head, and that he saw other of the veapons, laid upon the table, brought in by the Mtaona who had picked them np on the outiide.

The only other irticle spoken to by one. of Mr. Cajrtwright's ^rvants, is one which is brought forward at his time,^ Cor the purpose of applying it aftervaids tp evidence produced by others, to ix upon one of the prisoners the liaving been heie.

VOL. XXXI. ^^ >wf-i-,

the wuober of persons tumuUaously and riot? ously assemblecU the time of night at whiclj they camOy the language used, and the manner in which the attack was conducted ; it is im« possible to doubt that this was a most riotous and tumultuous assembly of ill-disposed per* •003* and that they came there for tne purpose efiUsturbingthe public peace: and you will say. whether thejr did not begin to demolisb and puil down this mill.

Tae next question will be, whether any of the pnsoners now at the bar, were parties cn^ sagedinthis assembly. In inquiries of this aescription, in order to constitute the gliilt of a person diarged, either with the pulling do^ a house, if the house be entirely demolished, or the beginning to demolish and pull down the house, where the assailants are prevented from carrying tibeir purpose fully into effect, it is not necessary to fix upon the persons whp actually filed any of the pieces Uiat did Ih^ mischief, or whose hands actually directed anv oftfae malls or hammers which broke the wiiidows or the doors; but every person whp mixes and engages with a tumultuous assembly of this sort, who is present assuting the rest by his counteimnce end by hb voioe and enr couracement while the fact is committed, is equally gruilty, either of actually demolishing or of beginning to demolish (as the case mai^ beX with the man whose hand actnall)[ broke the door or began to pull down the building. And therefore it does not become necessaryt^ inquire partioolarly what esch individual pri* soner did, but whether he made part of this riotous mob or assembly at Mr. Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds.

In Older to show that the prisoners were of the party, thev have called on the part of the prosecution, nrst, a man of the name of William Hall, who is in that branch of the wooUen business, called a cropper, and who works at the shop of one John Vvood,at Longroyd Bridge near Huddersfiekl. He says that the other penons, whom he names, one of the name of Sowden, another of the name of Benjamin Walker, another of the name of Varley, and others, worked at this shop; aod he proceeds to give an account of the preparauons which were made for this attack. He says that one Joshua Dickinson, who was a journeyman cropper, came to their shop on Saturday the 11th of April, and brought some powder and ball* . It does not appear that any of these men now at the bar, were then working at the shop. HftU says, that Diekioaoh bcought near a pint of powder, a^d a little bag of balls» and two or three cairtiidf;es» . not mojre; that in consequenice of the directions which were given, he (William Hall) among the rest, went thi^ lughtinto sir Geoige Armytage^s fields, which appear to have bpen the place of meeting; that he (Hall) went with Smith and Dyson; that a# jhey . went along they overtook George Brook, of IxHJkwood; that when they got to six George. Aqnytage's fields, it was about ted oWoSi at nighty that they found there about

wo or three score people aBflembled together; that they stayed there good jmrt of an hour, that by that time a number or people who had "been got together amounted to a good deal above a huDdred, and that thef then began [to be called over and mnsteredy not bv names '(«ame8 midit hare been dangerous lor every body Vould hear them), but by numbers^ each roan having a particular number appropriated^ to which he was to answer; that be himself was No. 7f and answered to tiiat number; that there were different companies, a musket company, a pistol company^ and a hatchet company; that MeUor and Thorpe (who were convicted upon a former indictment, and who appear to have been the leaders) formed the men into a line; that the company of musket-men were formed in line, two deep; and then they OFdered £he witness Hall, and a man of the 'name of George Rigge, tP go last, that is in the rear of all the persons, and to drive the

people up, and to see that none of them went oack. That they accordingly marched from Jhe fields of sir George Armytagie towards the mill of Mr: Cartwright, at Rawfolds, over a moor caU^ Heartshead Moor
, the mill of Mr. Cartwright being about ^ree miles from these fields of sir ' George Armytage ; and he describes this particular spot in the fields of sir , George Armytage asbemg a place where there * was ^hat they qdl i^ dumb steepfe (an obelisk, 4»r something of, ibat kind); he further says, thai these other people, who had neither 'muskets nor pistols^ had some of them mails, and some of them hatchets, and some had nothing at all; that as they went along, many of .them got sticks or stakes, by way of arming themselves; that they were stopped before .they got to the milL and' were formM into lines thirteen abreast; tfiat Mbllor fbrmed his company^ of musket-men, and he thinks Hiorpe belongr^d to the nex( company, the pistol-men.

Ifhen he gives an account of tne names of (hose persons whom he recollects to have seen wl\i]e they were in the fields of sir George Armytage, and before they marched to Hartshead Moor, near the mill of Mr. Cartwright. He says tlfat he there saw James Haigh, one of the prisoners, Jonathan Deair the prisoner, standing next to him; John Ogden, James Brook, and John Brook; but that he did not see Thomas Brook there. He says that he saw John Walker there, and he saw John Hirst there; but John Hirst he did not afterwards see at the mill, 'fhen he proceeds to state, that when they had been formed into a lioei thev went on to the mill; that there was a deal of firing, and knodeinff with Aerrmsdls 'ai|d hatchets at the mill; and that at one time 'Mell0r, who appears to have been their leader, cri^ out, that the door was opened; and some of them cried out, "Fire at the beB,*' for the 'purpose of shooting away the bell (or, more likely, the rope to the bell) that he heard one of them say that ffiprc was a man shot; that he himself fired twice into the mill, and that there was firing Jrbni ttiemilVana into:

the milt, and that that filing cootiniied nearly twenty minutes. He says the t m firont was cut through, but it was never opened. You recollect the account Mr. Cartwrigki gavr, was, that the door was never bunt opei^ though the pannels were broken so as to aantt a man's he^. He finiher say9, that th^ afl afterwards got away as ftst as thej coold, ia all directions; that he himself w«nt througk the beck or stream from the mill-poM, ad made for High Town, and that die reaaon be went to High Town, vras, that he met indi the prisoner Hirst, whom he had iteeii at fiff fields of sir George Armytage belbre thn went to the moor, and whom he saw afterwanb when they were forming near the utill, aod that he went homewatds with litm towaids High Town, where* Hirst was going ;^ tkatke did not himself go home that night, bat weot back to sir George Armytage*t Adds:* fit then states, that about a fortnight after tios business had taken place,- Thdmas Brook brought a hat to the shop of Joiin Wood, and told the witness to get ft to where it beknyd if he could; and tlutt Mellor woM -know to whom it belonged. -This wQl not be intdlicible, without attending in the first place to what was proved by the peoj^e beloBgibg to Mr. Cartwright's mill; that there was a hat found in the pool of the mill, so thst some one person who was there had lost a hat. Yea wiU find in the course of the evidence, that a person in going home, called to borrow a hat, and had a hat lent to him; and that a feitniglR after, a hat was brought to this shop of Mr. Wood, where the people worked, and thai Hall was desired to get it to the place where it belonged, to return that hat, which they had fbund a woman kind enough to lend thesi in their return ' from the mill. He aJbo says that Mellor, when Thomas Brook gave him that direction, referred him to the House ef Samuel Naylor, where the man had ealM aod borrowed the hat in his return.

On his cross-escaminarion. Hall sasrs that that night at ten o'clock he could see tolerably well matr it was not very dark, not so dark but he could know a man when he was near him, and that he saw the men vrfaen they were standing about in that field, that they eeenyed

a very lar^ space,, a larger sracel court. This is the evidence of William Hall, who (it is not necessary to observe to voa) was as much implicated in this mischier, as any one of the persons standing at the bar. He 6 not therefore a person taiidin^ to dkat apric^ situation, that von can receive his evideone without considerable distrust and cantioii; and therHbre you will examine and see, whether, fiom the other iact^ proved" tti the caase, and the testiinony of other witnealses, these facts or any of diem sore proved by other et ideate, so as to convince 'you that^ bad as he is» yet in this respect.he speaks the tniA. His evidence is to be left to jynxt coandetrndoB, but, firom the thccovtat of his beiay ^eligaged ia this transaetioo; he does net shew hiais»lf w

Ihatliglilt that jwi can look at his erideace without caution. You will see how the other evidenoe in the cause falls in . with his^ and if you believe that he is telling the truth to you upon this transaction, he is a witness upon whose testiiAony you will relv.

The next witness called is Joseph I>rakey who is a cloth-dresser, and worked at John Drake's. He says, that he likewise was at Mr. Cartwrisht's mill on Saturday night the 11th of Appilnly.and that he went there with ihe prisoners John Walker and Jonathan Dean^ that th^ went together from Dean's house; that he had known them both some time; that ihey set out at ten o'clock at night to go to sir George Army ti^'s fields, which was the place :hey were appointed to meet at; that, as they were going, they overtook several people who were going the same way, biit none of the ;>risoners were among those whom they overlook; that when they were all assembled together in the fields of sir George Armytaee, the number might amount from 130 to 150 persons; that in.these fie^s of sir George Armytage they were mustered into companies by lumbers, and were placed two by two; that he company to which he (Drake) belonged, was the pistol company, a company where the nen's arms were pistols; how many companies here were he does not know, but there were companies both of muskets and of pistols, and I company of men they called hatchet men; hat tney proceeded, two by two, to Cartirright's mm; that sixty yards before they irrived at the mill the^ halted, and he did not (o nearer than about sixty yards from the mill; hat there were a good many stopped behind he main body, which proceeded on to the nill; that he gave his pistol up before he lalted (he does not teU us what ue did there, n for what purpose they halted there); that a (ood many of them proceeded on to the mill; hathe heaida loud firing, and that it continued rom a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes; hat he remained within the distance of sixty rards of the mill during the whole time tins vas going on; that a good many had proceeded to the mill, he cannot say how many.

Then lie gives an account of those persons tmong the prisoners at the bar, whom he inows to have been there/ He says Jonathan ^)ean was there, and had a hammer with him; fohu Walker was there, and he had a pistol, ind a smock frock on. He says that he does lot know James Haigh; that be was soliciied o go there by Walker; that he himself did not (o to Walker alter the attack, l>ut that he saw he prisoner Thomas Brook somewhere near ^lign.Tourn, which was Uie place to which Qany of them went in their way home after the attack; that at that time he did not know lim, and that that night was the first time he lad seen him; that when he saw him near (ligh Town, he was without his hat, and his ::lothes were very wet, and he thinks he said le had been in the dam; that Mellor was with rhooai Brook at that time; that . at :Hi^

, Town they stopped at the house of one SamueJ Nay lor, where a hat was borrowed j by 'George Mellor, of a woman, for Thomas Brook; tlu^ Thomas Brook went home in that hat. Tht^ is the evidence I alluded to, when I stated to yoo, that evidence would afterwahls be given^ confirmatory of the circumstance of the hat having been found; so that it should appear that Thomas Brook was the person who had been in the water, and had lost his hat, and that he called with Mellor and this witness, and borrowed a hat, with which he went home; and it was to this house that Mellor afterwards desired the former witness to 'coiitrive the means of getting this hat back again. He then describes them as calling at another place, called Clifton, and that If ellor and brook calUd for something -to eat; it, was ^ private house, and they asked for «ome xpuffin and water, which were giwn to Qiem by a woman out of a window. Afterwards, you will recollect, that both the woman, at whose house they called at , High Town, to borrow the hat, and the woman at wliose house 'they called at Clifton, to get somelKead and some water; are called to prove that persons Mfhom they^d not know cadled, and that they ^u^ plied them, the one with a hat, and the other with some muffin-bread and some watec, out of the window. This witness says that he met with John Ogjien at High Town after the attack was over; that he then had a pistol with him, and said he had been at the attack of Mr. Cartwright's mill; that they went together to a place which he calls CaWdift^ where they parted; and that he knows him well, and, has seen him often between thai lime and this.

They next caB a man of the name of Benjamin Walker, who says that he was one of the party that went to Aawfolds mill on the hight of the attack, with Thomas Smith and Thorpe ; that he saw none of the prboners in sii' UepKC Armyiage^s fields, nor titi he go^ to the mlD, when they were called over, and he answered to Ko. 13 ; that they were formed in sir George Armytage's fields; that they then went into a; close a little >\ay before they got to the mill ; that he himself had a gun, and was in the first company, which Mellor led ; that that company was chiefly armed with guns ; that in the place where they halted just before they got to the nill, he saw the prisoner Jonathan Dean^ and he took p^ticular notice of him, because he gave him a sip of rum before diey halted, aftier they had left sir George Armytage's fields, and just before they came up to the mill; tliat he docs not know whether Dean had a hammer or not^ that after having so halted, they went up to the miU; that when they got up to the mill, there was firing on both sides ; that foe £i«d ; that he saw a man of the name of Booth there, wonnded, who is since dead ;.diat whei he got home he went into Jonathan Dean's hous^ that Dean was then in bed, and his hands were thleedisg, and he said he liad ^oi

■idly hnti, and that he had been shot in the finger. He says the penonsi with whom he went home from the mill that night were, George Mellor, Joseph Drake, Thomas Brook, and another chap from CawdifF, whose name he did not know (this answers Drake's aecount of Pgden) ; that they stopped a little while as they went along, and ^ot a hat ibr Thomas Brook (this accords with the account likewiie given % the former witness) ; that Thomas Brook told them that he had lost his own in the mill-goit, thai he had Men into the millgoit, and his clothes were very wet. The fact that somebody's hat was in the mill-goit is «lear by the evidence of the servants of Mr. Cartwright ; and this man as well as the other, speaks to Thomas Brook afterwards having his clothes wet, and calling at the house of Naylor for the purpose of getting a hat for him. This witness further says, diat in going from sir George Artayt^n fields to the place where they hailed before they got up to the mill, he saw another of the prisoners, John Walker, who had then a pistoi with him, but he never saw him afterwards ; that while they were in sir George Armytage's fields, he saw also the prisoner James Haigh there, and he thinks he was armed with a mall; that he never saw Haigh any part of the time but that ; (but, from the evidence which was given afterwards, it appears as if there was no doubt of his bieing somewhere else, as well as in these fields ; he says they stopped at Clifton, and got some bread and some water, it was what they called muffin-bread, which was

fiven them by a woman out of a window; that e himsdf had both a gun and a pistol, and he «ive the gun to a man of the name of Variey; that he had on a mask, and some of the others had masks on, which they were directed to bum when the attack was over.

This is the evidence of these three versons, Who mdy be considered as all engaged in the very same tumult, riot and felony as the pri* soners, and who have given this account of seeing the prisoners there.

The next person called was a man of the name of Sowden, who was another workman in the shop of Mr. Wood, but was not with the party at the mill. He savs that he himself was not at the attack of the mill; that he knows Jonathan Dean, John WaHier, and the three Brooks, That in the besinning of the following week after this attad upon Raw>folds, which happened on Saturday night, he heard John Walker say in Mr. Wood^ shop, that he had a horse pistol in his hand at the time of the attack, and that while looking in S)t Mr. Cartwright's window, there came a ball and struck the comer of his hat, and that he put his hand through the window with his pistol, and aimed it as Well as he could to the point from which the fia^ of the pistol, the ball from which had hit the comer of his hat, came, and he thought that if his Imnd went with it, it should go : So that this ims at least the boast which Jomi Walker hfade

the beginning of the weA aner ttt* torn skopr, where so many of the persons who had joined in this business were. This witness dao says, that John Walker and Jonathan Dean, were the first penohs that brooght any nitniisiioit to the shop, where these pMpSe woiked, thai frame-breaking was going on; tlwt Ibey cmne to them at their shop (that is the shop wlioe Sowden worked) to nxioest him and Iw Aopmates to meet, and consider and adopt pians ibr the destruction of madnnem on the sstBie principle as had been done at Nottingliav.

On his cross-examination, he says llttthe himself never approved of &e plan of framebreaking, that he detested it, that be did not join in any of it ; that he did not at that time imagine it would be brought to socb a pass as it was afterwards brought to ; that he oad not discover any of the circmnstances he has i^ lated to day, until he was asked, and he gives as a reason, because he was of a timid dsp<>sitioo, and was afraid of the comequenecs f6 hitnself ; but that the first time be was ever questioned about it (which was the t4tk of October) he told eveiy thing he had beaiA upon the subject, he never having engaged isi these transactions, bat having hem wfast had been said in the shops. That is the aooonat given by Sowden. He himself cannot ta upon any one of these persons as having been lliere^ not having been there himself, acootdijig t6 his own account. He only speiJcs as to John Walker having boasted, iht begimusig of the next week, of the part he had taken.

Hie next witness is Mary Btook, who is to substantiate the account which the witnesses have given with respect to her having delivered them the mufiin and the water out of the window at Clifton. She says, that on the night of this stir (as it is called) at Rawfolds, after she was in bed, some people came to her door, and asked to buy some bread of her. and that she gave theea some mafiln-bread and a pitcher of water through the window, and they gave her threepence for it. It is stated by the accomplices that they stopped, and had these articles in this way.

Then Sarah Naylor, who lies in High Towit, through which some of these men went in their way home, states, that she remcm\ien the night of Mr. Cartwright's mill being attacked; that in the course of that ni^a, some persons, whom she did not know, called at her house, and asked her to lend them anmn^ hat, that she saw only one poson that asked for it, and she lent it ; and diat not loa^ alter, she cannot particulariy speak to the tune, it was brought back again.

Richard Tatterson, and the two Or thne next witnesses, are ca&ed to prove eisoomstances with respect to the prisoner Haigh, for the purpose of shewing that Haigh was at Cartwright's, and that he was one of the persons who were wounded there and ealtied oit Tatterson sa^s that he psacttses suigeiy a litUe, and lives at Lepton, ii^aily four nolos and ahaifiiromHnd^enfteld. llraloitSarDdsy

The "witness says that he said nothing to Haigh, bat only dressed the wemd I that it appeared to him to be a bmise, as if it had been done by a ihll against « stone ; it was iVesh and bleeding, and the arm was bloody ; that he sfewed it up at each end and in the middle, and gare him somesalreto dress it with, and he saw him again on the Inesday ; and that is all that he knows about it. Joseph Cttlpan, who lives at- a lone house At a place called Peniston Green, at the dis^ tance of foarteen miles firom Hnddersfteld [Tatterson's being fbnr miles and a half) says, that DaltoB may be twelve nules distant from Peniston Oreen ; that a master cloth-dresser, ft relation of his, of the name of Aidron, who tives at Dahon, came with another person to this lone house where the witness Gulpan lives, at Peniston Green, on the 15tfi of April, four days after the night of the attack, at twelve or one o'clock at night ; that' he asked Aem what they came for, and Ardron said, to smoke a pipe ; that his wife knew Aidfon's voiee, and therefore desired him to open the door, which he did, and let them in ; that he bad no fire at that time ; that Aidron asked him to let them stay there tiH day^ligfat, and said the man that had come with him had got a hurt ; that be did not then know Ardron^s companhm, but he now knows it 4s the prisoner Haigh, who appeared to be lame about' Hm shouMer ; that they had bnt^nebed i^ (hebonse; ttkat after Azdron and his companion had been in a little while, the witness and his wife got up, and gave tfaem the preference of Ijrtng d^wnin their bed, and tney themselves' Ma^ up till next morhing ; that they then tiH tneakfosted together, tmd then the Witness €u)pan and Ardron went out togeHrer, leaving Haigh at this k>ne bouse at Penistion with CnTpan's wife, to stop there till Ardron eame btdt ; that Atdrm und the Wimess^ went together to a

plaee odM^nsbelf, and frtai tftat to Ardron's mother's at Wiley Bridge, and sAerwatds they came back again ; ^t iMgfar went from thetf house to the house of Ardron's mother^ al Wiley BridgCi the afternoon of the same day^; Hwt Haigh wte a- man who wovked widi Ardron, Ardron being his masier. The wi«* ness then describes &e distance fimm his boose to Aidren's mothcv's house to be about a{nHle^ and from bis^ house to Aidfon*s twelve mUeai So that according to the account he giwes, and piaricaUirly when you come to compare it with the evidence of the constable af^rwards, it iK»peais that Haigh came Uie very next day to Tailterson's bonse to have this wound dressed, md th^ afterwards he was brought to Peniston, and taken from place to place, evidenUy for the purpose of concealment; for no aooovmt Is given by evidence of what other oouid be th^ reason of his master oarrving bim in thts way ton lone house on Peniston Oreen, getting htm put to bed there, and then arrangiog for him to go to his mother's in another place*

Mr. Thomas Atkinson, who acted as a constable on this occasion, says that, ha^g a warrant to apprehend the prisoner Haigh efn the 23rd of April, he went on that day to his house at Dalton, but did not find him theiu $ Aathewasnot there himself, nor his wdfo; that he found they had been brewing, and imt the beer was in the brewing veaselS) jnst in the waf in which it had been left, without ever having been turned at the tiuM when, in the regidar order and process, it should have been turned. He pursued him from tfienee to T«tteraon*s, where he had got scent of this man* having been to be dressed; not finding him there, he then went to Peniston Green ; and not finding him there, he- then went to Mrs. Ardron's at Wiliey Bridge, and thenoe toWragby, and thence to Methlev, whereat last be found him on the evening or the 2t(fA.i that vras twelve days after the night tvben thfe attack had been made ; that this is altogethor a distance, by the shortest read, of nineteen miles from Dalton ; but going round in the way in whidi Haigh is proved to have gone^ it is much ftirther than rfiat ; and that at the time he ftrnnd him at his brother-in-laWs, he was wounded in the shoulder. So that the first object of this evidence is to show, that in the situation in which Haigh was with a wound in his shoulder, which had made him lame, he had gone away from his own bouo^ tricing this kmg circuit, and moving about from place to place; when, for a man who wanted rest — for the sake of his wound— it would have been more convenient to stay at his own house, if there was not a strong reason against it, namely, the apprehension of Ms being detected. The witness says that they took Haigh before a magistrate, and he was then examined, on the t4th ; that he ana was examined ; that something was said abont the shirt, upon which the wirt he then had on was taken off (and that shirt you, gentlemen, have seen, and that another wm^fivenMift

Hettddiy thaC) the shirt wair ti»iMtieil b^a militafj gentleaiftB who wat pivseni, M'l^ OordoBy^^ that tie hi the prisoner's preseaee said it nvas a mosket-tall that had mde that hole in the prisoner's syrt^ and that the pii^ sonar made no observation upon it« That waS} however, mere opinioo, and it was evidence only because it was stated in the pres^ice of the prisoner, and which he aught have an« sweied by explaining how it was that it had beeii occasioned.

Michael Bentley says, that he Kves at Methlev; thilt he saw the prisoner Haigh at his house the day beloie he was taken up^ when he caaae to be shaved; that when he saw him thera and shaved hko, he was lame in the edouldery he thinks it wa^ the left shoulder* This is clearly a mistake, for there is no doub^ tiiat the wound was in the right shoulder.

Fanny Milnes is called to Mpea^L respectinff ,the prisoner James Biook She s^ys she lived next door to him at Lpd&wood, and that the Sunday a^r this attadc, she saw a ff reat deal of whispering at his house ; that on that mom«ing she saw Jamea ^look, who, aceordiag to her acconnt, from the motion -of his hand appeared to be telUng some sonowful tale ; that she did not heat what he said; that there were plenty of SAen, who belonged to the cloth* oieasersy were coming to his house, and that ahe^ living next door, heard James Brook say, thai of all the dismal dius any body ever beard, that waa the most diamallGst, ana that yoanlight hear it half a mile, and he had rather be dammed to death than.be in such a •tir again. What he was aUuding to, she does not know ; this was all that she overheard, and dbe says, it was between ten and 'eleven o'clock. Upon her crosa-examination, she says that her husband had taken up this James Brook upon some foimer occasion, and ;]iad taken' him before a magistrate witboal a. arrant; that Brook was detained daring the night and then dischaiged; and that Brook then bioQght an action against him for that assault and folse imprisonment, and that he .recovered sji^nst her husband a verdict with some considerable damages. Then she is asl^ed, whether she ever said that on that aooount aha wo^d be even with him, or with the •fomily of the Bredcs, or any thing of that kind; and she denies. ever having used those . «spressionB. Her evidence only shows that her hushand, at least, had something as a matter of oomplaint against Brook, and from her evidence it appeared that she thought that Bipok had reooveied a verdict for £images against her husband which he ought not and therefore she might not owe him any very good will.

The last piece of evidence piodnoed on the part of the prosecution, is the examination of the prisoner of the name of Hirst before Mr. Seott, on the 2iid of November last. When this charge was made against him, and he was asked what he bad to say, he said, "We were ordered to meet at the obelisk i^^i Geoige

AnqQftage^s AeWa; . when- we got theie, we found- a great many men, who said that if we did not go with then they would abooi ns ; so we went to Rawfolds, aiul we saw aoow finn^ tobesuve^ I came home as for aa Hartshcad with William HalU'' That is the only aocooni he gives; he does not deny his meeting in or George Armytage^s fields with Jthe rest, aad his giHUg on, but ha attributes hia igoing oa from sir Grec^ge Atmytage's, to thair thva^eaing that they would shwt him if be did not; but he does not state any leaaon why lie aet the rest at sir Geoige Armytage'a before ifaqr proceeded to the attack of this milL

This is all the evidmoe on the paxt of tk prosecution, and it shortly consists of this; of the evidence of those persons vdio stood in the situatioa of accomplices, who were there dieoiselvas, and who meak of the priaooers atths bar being there also in diffiBrent parts of the transat^n, aad likewise give an aooonntof the diiforent drcuoMtaaces which took pboe in going to this mill, while there^ and during the tiaw when th^ were gomg honae ; and of the testimony of diffeient witnesses 6om various places, as to these separate and distinct circumstances, to confirm the accomplicei in those parts of the case to wludi th«;y have alluded. They have likewise called to yea that witnesBof the name of .Sowden, who was himself no par^ ia any of these tranamrtions, but was working in the same shop wImts the others worked, and who speaka of course to nothing that took place that night, he not having been with any one of them, bat gives evidence as to one of the prisoneis. Walker, having, the beginning of the week after, boasted of the part he had taken ia the attack of this mill. With respect to Ha^h, theie i* all that evidence, none of which b al all aplaiqed oa his part, of his having, on the very next day, been dressed for a wound in the shoulder; the account that he gave, heiag, that it was cat by a. stone in oonseqnanoe of a fall which he had had ; and then as to the manner in which he was treated, by being carried about from place to place, till he was app*** headed where the constable afterwards maud him. And then you have, as to paiticttiar prisoners, that which has been proved, aad the admissioB, in the examination of Hust himself, that he was there, and that he went £iohi the millas for as Heartohead with WilUav Hall; aad so for by his own acknoadedgmeat he confirms the aoeount .which WilUam HaH, who was one>of the accomplices exmaaiaed before you, gave, that this man Hint was oae of the pmons who went home in eompany with him.

On the part of the prisoners, they have gone into a considerable length of evidence, which, as there was so many diftsrent priaeDom, it WW of eourae to be expected th^Qr-shodld go i The first evidence gone into, was with re to some of the prisonem at the bar, to that this account,, as far as it _ must bf- fake or . iBooae6t,.beeauie (hey '

lot there at ^e time. Yon dbeerve, • aoeoidng to the evidence on the pert of the Crown, hat, on the erening when this attaek wat nade, they were appointed to meet at ten o'clock at night, in fir George Armytage'i leMs ; that they 8ta3wd thete some time, and tfterwarde marched np ; and, aeccMrdtng to the iccount giren fay Mr. Cartwight ai to the time vhen it happened, it mast h»re been a quarter, vr thereabouts, after tweWe, ivhen the attaek »n the mill began, because he fixes the time then he went to bed la be soon after twelre, ind savs that in a qoMler of an hour the attack Mgan bvtheirfiraig their pieoesat the mill, and J knocking al the windows. The evidence goes to prove that three of these prisoners were elsewhere.

The first that they begin with, is James Brook. For him there is called a man of the name of Thomas Ellis, who says that he is a wool-stapler, that he lives at Lockwood; that he knows the prisoner James Brook, who lived with his lather at Lockwood; and that on the Saturday when Mr. Cartwright's mill was ttacked, he (Thomas Ellis) had stayed at Huddersfield till about nine o'clock in the evening; that after that he had stopped at

Spring Gardens coffee-house, in his way home to Lockwood, tin half past ten; that he then went towards home about a quarter of a mile; that in going home he saw James Biook opposite his house, going the same way that he (Ellis) was going, and that it was then a quarter before twelve at night. So that he would make it a quarter before twelve at night, that he, having spent the evening as late as past nine at Huddersfield, and afterwards at Spring Gardens, overtook James Brook near his own house at Lockwood. It is perfectly clear, from the distance and the time, that if James Brook was at Lockwood at a quarter before twelve that night, he could not have been at Mr. Cartwright's mill. He says there were several other »eo^e on the road at the time that he saw him. He is then asked as to character; and he says he believes there is not a man in Lockwood, nor all round, who bears a better character than all the Brooks do. There are two other Brooks as well as James Brook, prisoners upon this occasion.

The next witness upon the same facts is George Armitage, who lives at Lockwood. ie says that on that same evening he was at Huddersfield, and retanied home at nearly twelve o'clock at night, and that he saw the 1st witness, Thomas Ellis, and afterwards rent from Thomas BUi^a in consequence of somethng Thomas Ellis had said to him, to upes Brook's father's house, and that he d^re ound James Brook the prisoner sitting by the fire, and that the father called td them while they were talking by the fire; that the next morning he heard what had been done at Rawfold's mill. Upon his cross-examination, he says, that he is a blacksmith; that he was a iritnete upon the fortnercase of George Mellor; that he saw the clock at the thna he * wae at

IMis's and ^at it was soiaei»hciB neav five minutes stfter twelve; that he never was applied to upon this subject, to recollect the transaction, or to speak to it, tiUhewas subpttnaed. The same inquiry has been made of several of the witnesses, who speak to a particular hour on that night, when thef saw particular persons. And they all of them state, that the next day they heard what had happened at Cartwnght's mill; but stUI the neat day there was no charge made against any of these prisoners, as having been engaged in any thing at Cartwright's mill, and therefore they were not asked at the time, whether they recollected this or that man betuff at home. It does not appear that any of them, except Haigh, were charged with this offence tiUkwg afterwards; and it ii an observation made with regard to the accuracy with which they speak to having seen particular persons on that evening, that they may have been in the habit of seeing them other evenings.

Hannah Tweddle is then caHed, for the per* poseoftakittgoffthe effect of (what had net periiaps a great deal) the evidence of the last witness caUed on the part of the ^frosecatiea, Fanny Milnes, who spoke to havmg hesid a declamation made by James Brook, who lived next door te her, vriiere she first saw by his action that he was telling a dismal Moiy, and aftervrards heard him say that it was one ofthe dismallest dins he ever had hesvd in his lilh. Hannah Tweddle is catted to prove some iM will on the part of Fannv Mifaies towards Brook. She says, that she lived next deer te Brook ; that she knows Fanny Milnee; that she heard her say one dav, tmtt she was detenuned to see some of the Brooks distressed before they came from this place^ and that she hoped to do it. She wasfallmeoutat that tia—

widi a young man at her doer, and' in the ofthe 1

altercation with thia young man, she made use of these expressions. She sam that this.might be a ffaw weeka back, and that she said, some of them must be hanged befbse they left this phice. That merely applies to the question, what reliance amy ae hMf plaeed upon the aoeonat Fanny Mibea mk given.

The next witnesses they called vrere wiA respect to the prisoner ThooMS Brook, in order to show that he could not have been atllM» mill that night. John Ellis, a doth^resserat Lockwood, savs, that he is acquainted widi Thomas Brook, that he vroiked for Bieek, that he did so on the day of the attaek on Rawfblds mill; that they were very bn^ at woric on the evening of that day, and that be and Thomas Elam and Jonathan Vickerman were working together; that Thomas Brook did net vrork at the sheai4xMud where thejr were working; that he saw Thomas Brook come in that evening; that they had woriLod till he came to them to ask them whether they knew what time in the evening it was they were working to, and that he UM them it was :naar twelve o^cloek; that. upon, that they im-

iB0diatdi]rl«diwvi9:» and ^cut itflo th* btKM and dfew their ^9gt»i that there was oo acarci^ of work.; ^bat he cittfiot femeaher ihe names eC -the j^^esons eomini^ in ditiing <he lime itbey wefe «t work, but ti^at they were at weik'iiU i»ear twelve that mghit; thi^they idl raceiTed their wMe*, na«i.djt# JSlajn, Vidbof* QMtat and hins^ll^ from Thomea Brook thftt ught, soon after twelw o'cloctk, after he Mi caUed them fran tfieif w^A, aakiqg them^ if th^ Jioew how iaie it was, and that he gave aaohi>f them a pound note. Then he is a«ked» what pawed when .thia money was paid; in «id»8t particular p^urt^ the xoo» it was paid» and at what tMe ; .wid describes particiiutfly that it waa on the filing table, that stands near the door as yc« %o in <m the lefik>hand .gide^ and that Brook put a pound note into aach man's hand ait the time they heard the otook strike twelve. At &rat be said iibe children were in the soon, and then that he.did not see the children ; that one of them, whi^

he says waa badl^, was on the wife's lap, and the others were in bed; that after he nad so reoeivod this money, they went a little way logtther, that they and lie then turned difleteatways. Ha la asked whether he could remember the time when first his master was taken up. He says be cannot. He says, too, that. they were working upon plain doth, inishiag it ; he cannot specif the colour. He is adted this, which is material, whether £lam and Vickezmaa are here, and he says they are bo^hei^; but they are not called. Now^ to he aure,, whon he speaks to a transaction of this yurt, pn:>ving Thomas Brook in his house, and refers himself for confirmation to two other troikmen, who must have seen eveiy thing 4hat he saw, and who, if in speaking to these pai!tienlars he has spoken truth, would agree 'frith hifti. in .these particulars; itisobvioiM to ,i«ttark, that unless it is pretty well known Ifaat th^ would not speak to those particuhurs, there appoars no reason why they should not be called.

The next witness is as to John Walker. iMhard Lee is oalted to pcolw him elsewhere ; 1m says, that he knowns John Walker of Longroyd very well, that he has lived with him nearly six years at bed and board at his house; that on this Saturday night of the attack on the mill, he himself was at home at John Walker's house; that he went home, there at eight or .tdae iia 4he evening, and stayed at home the whole of the night a&er; that Walker was not at home when first dte witness went home, but that became in between ten and eleven o'clock; that, after he came in, he went out for a little time with Jose^ Walker to fetch two bsmows of coak from Hannah Blakey's, and that at ^eren o'clock, or soon afterwards, John Watter r«ha!ved Joseph Walker, and then Joseph Walker went to his own home, and he mm no more of him. He mts that John Walker slept in the house that night that the witnoss slept in the room t «?cr hi» ; that J^hn .WaU^ vlways slept in te nKwx below with |

his wife, and that he is siiie he did not i^n eat after that time, for that he heard him in bed. If his account was a true one, it is not material to iotuire whether he went out aAorwanlib fi>r it is impoasibie he should haiF« been at Rawfolds after that period: the question is whether his account is a true one. llaaayi that after oletrea o'clock he shared t)iia Josefili Walker, and that afterwards Jonofpli went fiway, aed the prisoner John Walker stopt in bed with his wife, a»i he (loe) up sCkiirs; that Joseph Walker had been waiting for Jel« Walker'« eaaaiiv in; that Joseph Walker had come in alt ten, and had stayed till John Walker came in, and that nobody biu ka and Joseph Walker came in; that, as soon as John Walker came in, his wife told him they wanted coals,, and that John Walker asked Josajdi to go and help him fetch them, and that they accordingly went, and nothing waa said about money to pay for them. He also says, that he never hem id John Walker being taken ay till October.

Then Joseph Walker is called. He is the brother-in-law of John Walker, having married the wife's sister. He says that be was at the prisoner's house on the night of the attack ea Cartwright's mill; that he went there to be shaved about ten o'clock; and that vriian U acriTedf John Walker was at home. The other witness, Lee, had said, that Joe Walker had come in, and waited with him, and with John Walker's wife, till John came home. JfosefA Walker says, that he himself went to Jobs Widker's house to be shaved about tea o^dod^, and that, when he got there, John Walker was at home; that he asked him to asenct him in getting a few coals; that they fetched two baxTOws from Hannah Blakey's; that after they had fetched them, the prisoner shaved him, and that then he left his house at twenty minutes before twelve, and went back to Huddersfield; that he heard the town dock strike just before he got home, just as he entered the town; that Lee, the kttt witness, was in the house when he came in. He is particularly asked, how John Walker was engaged when he went in; and he says, John Walker masmtiiag in his chair, honing his raiors at the time he went in, at ten o'clock at night. To be sure, he differs materially in his recollection tern Lee, for Lee says that Joseph Walker had come in and had waited for John Walker's coming ta, Ibr that John Walker was not at home; whereas, according to Joseph Walker's account, he found John Walker sitting in a chair, boniag or whetting his razor, when he got in.

Hanm=nah Blake, the next witness, am^ tM she deals in cws; that she luaewa John Walker; that she remembers the affair at Rawfolds; that on that evening tJkti prisoner came about eleven in the evening; that she knows it Mftt the night Mr. Cartwright's mill was attacked, bcause they came so fie, from having heard early the next morning what had happened. Why she should knew it from having heard fl^eiiaxtDiprmog,9Ji9l had happened, unless this prisoner was connected with what had happened, one does not know; for there was no change against this man at that time, as having been at the attack on the mill, she says he did not pay for the coals, and she nit them dowii upon a slate; that she has always kept it in her recollection that it was this dslight. She was asked, what was the other time before that time, that the prisoner had been supplied with coals; and she says, he might be supplied every week, but it depended upon the season or the time of the year, but she cannot recollect any other time that he had been supplied, having kept no other nifl^t n her recollection but this particular night, rrfaich she kept in consequence of having heard of fhe attack on Cartwright's mill the next morning.


TO DO above

That is all the evidence given by the witnesses for the prisoners, for the purpose of showing that the account of the witnesses for the prosecution could not be true, because they were either at home or anywhere else; and it is applicable to James Brook, Thomas Brook, and John Walker.

They then call a number of witnesses as to the character of the different prisoners.

They call first, as to the charactef of James Haigh, the man who had the wound in the shoulder, Mr. Mills a cloth-dresser, who speaks to his having been apprentice with him, and that he has known him ever since, and he has always maintained a good character.

Joshua Wood, a cloth manufacturer, states, that he has known him a good while, and he has maintained a good character. As to Thos. Brook, he speaks to his character being good.

As to Jonathan Dean, they have called Joseph Brook, who states, that he has known him four years and upwards, that he has worked with him, that he is a cloth-finisher, and that his general character, since he has known him, has been a very good one.

James Garside says, that he is a cloth-dresser; that he has known the prisoner Dean six or seven years, and that his character at Longroyd Bridge, and in that neighbourhood, has been that of an honest and industrious nan.

Joshua Priestly has known Dean a dozen years, and during that time his general character has been that of a peaceable industrious man.

Joseph Riley, a tailor, has known Dean ever since he was a boy, and his general character has been very good. Then he speaks of a circumstance which seems to have nothing to do with this case; that when he was a little boy he had met with a wound in his head from the unkindness of his step-father, and that he had fits. But it cannot be pursued so as to show that he was not in a situation to know what he did, and to discern right from wrong; and, therefore, it appears to have nothing to do with the present inquiry.

Richard Beaumont says, that he is a clothier; that he knows the prisoner Ogden, who has worked for him two years last July; that he had known him five years, and that he always maintained an honest, industrious, and peaceable, character.

Abel Armitage, who is a clothier, says, that he has known Ogden five or six years, that he was always a very steady hard-working man, that he seemed very industrious, and that he has a wife and two children.

William Haigh speaks as to all the Brooks. He says he has known the three Brooks from their youth, and that they have borne a good honest character; that they are as honest people as any in the neighbourhood.

James Garside also says that he knows the three Brooks very well, and has known them seven or eight years, and that during that time, they have borne a very good character as honest industrious men.

Joshua Wood states, that, he has known Thomas Brook for many years, and he gives him a good character.

As to John Walker, William Haigh states, that he has known him for some years back, and that his general character has been that of a laborious honest man, for any thing he knows.

Then as to the last prisoner, Hirst, there are two witnesses, one of the name of Holdfield, and one of the name of Shipley; they have known him, one of them, ten or twelve years and the other during the whole of his life; and they speak of his having borne a good character during the whole of his life.

This is the evidence which has been given as to character. And with respect to the effect of character, the proper and the only proper influence it can have in inquiries into the truth or falsehood of a charge brought against prisoners, is this; that if the evidence leaves it a matter of fair and reasonable doubt whether a party is guilty or not; in common cases, if you prove that a prisoner up to that time has always maintained a good character, it will apply and balance in his favour; but if the evidence of guilt is satisfactory to the minds of a jury, evidence of previous good character cannot and ought not to have any avail.

The question in the present case will be, how far you are satisfied that the evidence which has been laid before you upon the part of the prosecution, has made out that, which they are bound for the prosecution to make out; that these several prisoners at the bar, or ainanyr of them, have been guilty of that crime which is laid to their charge; namely, beginning to demolish or pull down this mill of Mr. Cartwright's at the time stated in the indictmennt stated to you in the outset, how far all were implicated, who joined in that riotous meeting with that intent; and the question is, whether the prisoners at the bar are satifactorily pnoved to have been of that nmmber. To prove that they were so, there is the evidence of three persons standing in the situation of accomplices, standing therefore in the situation of persons, whose evidence you will receive with caution, with a degree of scrupulousness, and whom you will expect to be confinned by persons whose testimony is less suspicious, before you give credit to the account they lay before you. You will judge how far they have or have not been supported by the other witnesses who have been called. It is not necessary, that in the whole of the account they give, they should be supported by other testimony; but if you find, from the support they receive from other witnesses, that they are telling truth in some particulars, you will, of course be justified in believing that they are telling yon truth in the whole of their narration. On the contrary, if you find that they are speaking falsely in some particulars, you will then mistrust their testimony in the whole. Now the present case certainly does not rest upon the testimony of one, nor indeed of all taken together; but the facts which they have spoken to are, in many instances which I have detailed to you, and which I have observed upon as I went along, supported and confirmed by different persons unconnected with them, and who have been drawn from different parts and different places. In addition to that, you have some circumstances applicable to some particular prisoners, which do not depend at all upon that sort of testimony, I mean particularly the situation of the prisoner Haigh the very next day, applying to have a wound in his shoulder dressed and the way in which he was carried about till the time of his apprehension. With respect to the circumstance of the hat being found in the mill-stream, it is not proved whose hat it was by any of the people who found it; but it appears, not only by the testimony of the accomplice, who said he went home With Thomas Brook, that he was wet, and was without a hat, but also from the testimony of Naylor, that that same night, several people called and borrowed a hat, which hat was afterwards returned.

You will put all these circumstances together, and after the attention you have paid to this case, it will be for you to say, whether or not you are satisfied that these prisoners were of that party who began to demolish this mill; and if you are satisfied that the evidence fixes this crime upon any of the prisoners, as with respect to such against whom you think it defective, you will acquit them; as to the others, you will convict them, and if you think it does not apply to any of them you will acquit them all. If you find the account of the accomplices confirmed as to all which is more indeed than can be expected, they must all bear the fate of the same verdict. You will consider the case, and form any discrimination which in your judgment you think the case deserves.

The jury retired at six o'clock, and returned at sevem, finding James Haigh, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, Thmoas Brook and John Walker,— GUILTY.

James Brook, John Brook, and John Hirst—NOT GUILTY.

Sussex Advertiser - Monday 25 January 1813

THE EXECUTION AT YORK.

*From "The Leeds Mercury" of Saturday, January 16.*

About eleven o'clock in the morning, John Ogden, Nathan Hoyle, Joseph Crowther, John Hill, John Walker, Jonathan Dean, and Thomas Brook, were led from their cell to the place of execution; and after the usual devotional services, the dreadful sentence of the law was upon them. A few moments before the sentence of the law was executed, John Hill advaaced to the front of the platform, and said, "Friends, all take warning by my fate; for three years I followed the Lord; but about half a year since I fell by little, and at last I am come to this. Oh, take warning!"

At half past one o'clock, soon after the dead bodies of the seven criminals above enumerated had been removed, John Swallow, John Baltey, Joseph Fisher, William Hartley, James Haigh, James Hay, and Job Hay, were led to the fatal tree, and after the usual time spent in prayer, the drop fell, and they were launched into eternity.

All the prisoners conducted themselves in a manner becoming their awful situation, and made a general confession of their guilt. The spectators, particularly at the execution in the morning, were unusually numerous; and large bodies of military, both horse and foot, guarded the entrance to the castle, and paraded the front of the place of execution. Not the, slightest disorder manifested itself amongst the populace.

The Special Commission at York, has, for the present, terminated in sittings, and we sincerely hope and pray that there may never be occasion to resume them: neither the Grand nor Petit Jury have been discharged, and the Court adjoursed till Tuesday morning during pleasure. The Commission continues in force till the 1st of February—the dreadful result of these unhappy disturbances, which have so much afflicted, and so greatly disgraced certain manufaciuring districts in the West Ridiag of the County of York. The result is indeed infinitely distressing; the numbers of persons executed is without parallel in the annals of this country, except in the rebellion of 1745. The shock produced by so unexampled an exerclse of criminal justice, is not be described. We wish, and devoutly pray, that the blood of these unhappy men may not be shed in vain; but that it will induce all to avoid those illegal associations, which must sooner or later conduct them to an untimely death.

2+7+4+2+5+7+3+6+1+3+7+8+2 = 57 which appears to account for that oft quoted figure.
