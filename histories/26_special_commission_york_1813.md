YORK, WEDNESDAY, JAN. 6.

EXECUTION.

On Friday *W. Thorpe*, *G. Mellor*, and *T. Smith*, convicted on Wednesday last before the Special Commission at York, of the murder of Mr. Horsfall, were executed on the New Drop behind the Castle at York. After the usual prayers with the Ordinary, they each of them prayed a considerable time, in which they confessed the heinousness of their crime; Mellor addressing the populace, said, "there is some people there that have brought me to this, but I freely forgive them as I hope to be forgiven."— After hanging the usual time, their bodies were taken to the York County Hospital to be dissected and anatomized, agreeably to their sentence. Since their condemnation they had behaved in a penitent and contrite manner, regretting sincerely the crime for which they suffered.— Thus have perished, in the very bloom of life, three young men; who, had they directed their talents to lawful pursuits, might have lived happy and respected.— They were young men on whose countenances nature had not imprinted the features of assassins.— On the fate of these malefactors, and on the dangerous tendency (to themselves we mean) of the association of which they were members, one observation presents itself so obvious as to force itself upon the notice of all, and yet too important to be omitted at the close of the melancholy details that we have felt it our duty to lay before the public. It will from hence appear, that men confederated for the commission of crimes, can have no well grounded confidence in each other —not even when their compact is confirmed by oaths and cemented in blood. — If this be admitted; and the history of every age and country, as well as the fate of George Mellor, William Thorpe, and Thomas Smith, confirms the truth of the observation, the inference is irresistible, that all those persons who may happen in future to be invited to became members of such confederacies, should resist such invitations, as they would avoid the greatest calamity; and all those who may have been so far infatuated as to become members of such societies, should, from this moment, and by our common consent, desist from taking another step in furtherance of their objects. They must now see that they have stood on the brink of a frightful precipice, and that another step might have plunged them into that gulph that has overwhelmed their less fortunate associates.

London Chronicle - Wednesday 20 January 1813

January 10, EXECUTION OF THE LUDDITES AT YORK.

Precisely at eleven o'clock, on Saturday, the following persons suffered the sentence of the law due to their crimes, viz.—John Hill, Joseph Crowther, Nathan Hoyle, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, Thomas Brook, and John Walker. The above persons behaved in the most penitent and contrite manner we have ever witnessed, placed in the melancholy situation in which they were. During the time the Ordinary was performing the functions of his duty, the repeated and earnest prayers of the culprits might be heard at a considerable distance, supplicating the Divine Being to receive their souls into everlasting rest. Many of them, after the Clergyman had repeated "The Lord have mercy upon you," in a very audible voice articulated "I hope he will." Previous to the Drop being let down, a Hymn was given out very firmly by John Walker, to his fellow-culprits, all of whom heartily joined in singing the same. The behaviour of the whole was truly becoming their awful situation, each of them expressing their sincere repentance for the crimes they had committed, and placing their only hope of Salvation through the merits of the Redeemer.—John Hill addressed the populace nearly in the following terms:—"I hope, my good Christians, you will take warning by the punishment you will see this day inflicted upon me and my fellow companions. I lived for a number of years in the possession of vital religion, but unfortunately the fascinations of the world gained an ascendancy over my mind, and I fell away from God and the paths of rectitude about a half a year ago. I want you, who now hear me, against the commission of mine, or any other crimes, which may subject you to the ignominious death I am now going suffer."

Half past One o'Clock.—The following prisoners, viz. John Swallow, John Batley, Jos. Fisher, W. Hartley, Jas. Haigh, Jas. Hey, and Job Hay, were executed at the time specified above. The whole of them evinced a spirit of contrition which we have seldom witnessed upon a similar occasion. The concourse of spectators, as at the former occasion, was numerous. James Haigh spoke to Mr. Lancaster, a gentleman residing in the West Riding of this county, at some length; he regretted the situation in which he was placed, and earnestly exhorted his fellow-sufferers to make their peace with God. James Hey said but little; however, he evinced, by his conduct on the Drop, a sincere and unfeigned repentance for the crime the laws of his country had subjected him to. John Swallow afterwards spoke to the populace in nearly the following terms:—"Ladies and Gentlemen, the situation in which I am now placed demands your serious consideration; being led astray by wicked and unprincipled characters, I was seduced from the paths of virtue, and fell into that dreadful time for which I am now going to suffer. I beg you to take warning by my fate, and I hope that God will grant you grace to live a life of sobriety and uprightness, in order to prevent your being brought to that situation in which I am now placed." The conduct of the prisoners was truly becoming their awful situation. The bodies were let down at half past two o'clock, and delivered to respective relations.

690. Proceedings under Commission of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery, for the County of York, held at the Castle of York, before Sir Alexander Thomson, Knight, one of the Barons of the Exchequer; and Sir Simon Le Blanc, Knight, one of the Justices of the Court of King's Bench; from the 2nd to the 12th of January: 53 George III a. d. 1813.

INTRODUCTION `[From the original report of these proceedings, printed at the time, under the authority of government, but not sold.]`

...

In the Spring of the year 1811, disputes arose between the masters and journeymen employed in the trade of weaving stockings and lace, which is carried on in the south-western part of Nottinghamshire, and the adjacent parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire; and without entering into the particulars of those disputes, which would be beside the present design, suffice it to state that in the month of November 1811, the discontents had arisen to such a height, that a mob, consisting of several hundred persons, assembled at Sutton in Ashfield in open day, and broke the stocking and lace frames of various obnoxious manufacturers. Before this mob was separated, some of the ringleaders were taken into custody by a party of yeomanry cavalry, and were afterwards committed by the magistrates to Nottingham gaol. From this disaster the malcontents learnt caution; and as the frames used in this manufacture are of a very delicate texture, and rendered useless by a single blow from a heavy instrument, they seldom, from this time, carried on the work of destruction openly, or in large bodies, but watched the opportunity of effecting their purpose individually, or in small parties, undercover of the night, and in spots where the machinery was least protected. This purpose was aided by the circumstances in which the manufacture is carried on in the vicinity of Nottingham. The frames, which are of considerable value, commonly belong, not to the persons by whom they are worked, but either to the master manufacturers, or to individuals unconnected with the trade, who let them to the artisans at a weekly rent; and thus the frames ares scattered in detached houses about the country, and are usually in the custody of persons who have no interest in protecting them from violence.

p. vii-xiii

In the neighbourhood of Nottingham, which was the focus of turbulence, the malcontents organised themselves into regular bodies, and held nocturnal meetings, at which their future plans were arranged. And, probably with the view of inspiring their adherents with confidence, they gave out, that there were under the command of one leader, whom they designated by the fictitious name of Ned Ludd, or general Ludd, calling themselves Ludds, Ludders or Luddites. There is no reason to believe that there was, in truth, any one leader. In each district where the disaffection prevailed, the most aspiring man assumed the local superiority, and became the general Ludd of his own district. These petty tyrants doubtless took their tone from the centre of the operations, but not (so far as has been traced) from any individual.

Under this system the Luddites, in the winter months, destroyed a very considerable number of stocking and lace frames, and infused such a terror into the owners of all, as to drive them to the precaution of removing them from the villages and lone houses, and placing them for security in warehouses, where they could be protected from injury. The evils, which the misguided journeymen proposed to remedy by their, measures, were, of necessity, much aggravated by throwing a greater number or hands out of work.

Although detection was difficult, from the mode in which the offences were committed, yet it did in some instances take place; and in the calendar of prisoners for trial at the Nottingham Spring Assizes, there were 18 committed for offences connected with the existing disturbances in that county.

As the intimidation of the master manufacturers and owners of frames was found to render them extremely averse to prosecution, and it was therefore little likely that any prosecution would in their hands be carried on with effect, it was deemed, by the government, to be absolutely necessary for the public good, that the course of justice should be opened, by taking the indictments out of the hands of the nominal prosecutors. And accordingly the whole of the causes were conducted by the counsel for the crown. It must be admitted that great lenity was shown in those prosecutions. None of the prisoners were capitally convicted; and in many of the cases, where they were found guilty of felonies within the benefit of clergy, the punishment awarded fell far short of that which the law would have authorised. How far this lenity was misplaced, will be seen in the sequel.

Whether the Luddites were encouraged by the mildness of the punishments which their confederates received at Nottingham, or by doctrines which were broached about the same period, casting doubts on the moral guilt of destroying machinery, or from any other causes; certain it is, that immediately after the Nottingham Assizes in March 1812, a spirit of discontent, which had for some weeks been brooding in other manufacturing districts of the North of England, was ripened into acts of open outrage; and we find that the south-western part of Yorkshire, and the contiguous parts of Lancashire, and Cheshire, in which the principal manufactories of woollen and cotton are established, immediately caught the flame of Luddism. Not only did the disaffected assume the appellation of the same supposed leader, but they followed the example of their Nottinghamshire brethren, in holding nocturnal meetings, dividing themselves into societies, which communicated with each other by delegates, exacting a tribute from all manufacturers in the same trade within their district, requiring obedience from their adherents in any scheme which should be resolved upon by their self-constituted rulers, and above all ensuring that obedience by the administration of an Oath `[See p. 110, 121, 89.]`, binding the party sworn to keep secret their designs, and to punish even with death any one who should betray their counsels. After securing, as they vainly imagined, a considerable number of partizans, by means of these illegal oaths, they proceeded to the execution of those purposes which they had primarily in view, namely, the destruction of the improved machinery, which is vitally necessary to the woollen and cotton manufactures, but which these deluded men, in their folly, imagined to be prejudicial to their interests. This idea is proved to have been carried from Nottinghamshire `[Evidence of Joseph Sowden, p. 154.]` into Yorkshire. But in the latter county, and in Lancashire, the principle was acted upon to a greater degree, and with much greater boldness, than it had been among the stocking manufacturers. Two greater outrages never were witnessed in a civilized country, than the attack made on the 11th of April upon the mill of Mr. Cartwright (which is the subject of one of the succeeding trials `[Haigh and others, p. 134.]`) and the burning of Messrs. Wroe and Duncuft's manufactory at West Houghton in Lancashire, on the 24th of the same month, for which several culprits were executed at Lancaster. Yet the spirit of outrage did not stop here: for the Luddites at length did not scruple to avow, that the breaking of the machinery was of no use, while the masters of that machinery were alive `[See p. 50.]`; and from thence they persuaded themselves that they should render a service to the public by the destruction of those masters, of whom several were personally attacked, and in one instance (which will be detailed hereafter `[Mellor and others, p. 35.]`) with fatal success. About the same period the high price of provisions caused some riots in the markets at Sheffield, Manchester, Macclesfield, and a few other places, where the venders of provisions were either plundered of them, or compelled to sell their articles far below the market price. The exertions of the Magistracy in Lancashire and Cheshire, had, early in the month of May, filled the gaols of those counties with prisoners charged with the various offences before alluded to. And upon representations from thence, it was determined to send down, without delay, commissions into each of those counties, for the trial of such prisoners. Those Commissions were accordingly issued, and were opened at Lancaster on the 23d, and at Chester on the 25th of May. Under each of those Commissions numerous convictions took place for every gradation of offence; and of the capital convicts, eight at Lancaster, and two at Chester, suffered the penalty of the law.

In Yorkshire, the course of justice was slower; and although the tide of Luddism appears to have been checked by the executions in Lancashire and Cheshire, and by the Acts `[52 Geo. III. c. 17, 104, 130, 162.]` passed by Parliament relative to this subject, yet no very important discovery of the perpetrators of the more atrocious crimes committed in the county of York, was made earlier than the month of July. In that month some commitments took place, and information was obtained, which gradually led to the detection of the parties to the nefarious scenes recorded in the following pages. And it is but justice to say, that these discoveries have been in a great measure owing to the unremitting zeal and persevering courage of one magistrate residing in the very hotbed of disaffection, near the town of Huddersfield. Early in the present winter, the gaol of York having become thronged with prisoners, and some of them committed for very heinous offences, it was resolved by Government to issue Commissions for bringing them to an immediate trial; and those Commissions having been directed to Mr. Baron THOMSON and Mr. Justice LE BLANC, they appointed the 2d of January for opening them at the Castle of York. The cases which will be detailed in the following pages, will exhibit a melancholy portrait of the depravity of human nature. We see young men, capable of gaining an ample livelihood by honest industry, led to the commission of the most heinous crimes, without any adequate, it may almost be said, without any, motive. They fancy themselves aggrieved by the improvement of machinery. They take redress into their own hands. To secure their object, they form societies, linked together by illegal oaths of secresy. They thus fancy that they have secured to themselves impunity, and they proceed to the perpetration of the most horrible outrages on the property and persons of individuals, against whom they are actuated by no personal malice; and do not even stop, short of shedding the innocent blood of men, who have given no other cause of offence, than by firmly pursuing their lawful callings, not only in a harmless manner, but in that best calculated to promote the interests of the community.

We see, in several instances, that the disaffected had experienced such success, as to make them speculate on `[See pp. 89, 112, 124.]` oversetting even the Government of the Kingdom; and it is to be feared, that the embers of revolutionary principles, which had been smouldering for several years, were revived in the country where these scenes were acted, by the fancied grievance of improved machinery, and the temporary success, which its destroyers met with in the vicinity of Nottingham. Encouragement was given by the doubts cast on the moral turpitude of these crimes; and the evil was raised to its height by the religious fanaticism, which unhappily exists, in an excessive degree, in those populous districts.

The supposed grievance of which these deluded men complain, arising from the improvement of machinery, has been denominated a fancied grievance. It would be wasting time to argue upon the undoubted right of every subject of this kingdom to conduct his trade in such manner as he may deem most conducive to his own interests, unless where the wisdom of Parliament 

has controlled him by regulations. But the events of the last year prove that it may not be altogether superfluous to shew how it is that the improvement of machinery is beneficial, instead of being detrimental, to the interests of the labouring manufacturer, as well as to the community at large. It is obvious, that the demand for any commodity increases with its cheapness, and that the purchaser will resort to the market at which it is sold at the lowest rate; and therefore, that every thing which contributes to the cheapness encreases the demand, and gives an advantage to the market, where such cheapness exists, over all other markets where, from local causes, the commodity cannot be sold at so low a price. Where the demand encreases, the number of hands employed will encrease aiso. But nothing has been ever found to contribute so much to the cheapness of a manufactured article, as the use of machinery, which enables the same work to be done, not only in less time and with fewer hands, but by persons of earlier age and of less robust constitutions, than can render themselves useful while all the operations are to be performed by bodily strength. Hence all the members of a family are now enabled to contribute towards its support, instead of relying (as formerly was the case) altogether upon the exertions of the husband and father, who still has many parts of the manufacture to which he may apply his vigour, and earn ample wages. What then would be the consequence, if the endeavours of the disaffected could succeed in the expulsion of machinery? The wife and the young children would be thrown out of employ; the husband and the father must support them entirely by his own labour; the price of the manufactured goods would be raised, the purchaser would resort to a cheaper market, where the use of machinery was encouraged; the trade would decay; the manufacturer would gradually discard his journeymen, or reduce their wages; while their families would become more and more burthensome; and finally, nothing but poverty and misery would prevail.

A notion has been entertained by some, that the disturbances have been in a great degree ascribable to poverty and distress, arising from the want of foreign markets for our manufactures. It has been already stated, that at a few towns, in the spring of the last year, there were some riots arising from the high price of provisions; but in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, which was the metropolis of discontent, not the least symptom is to be discovered of Luddism having arisen from these causes. On the contrary, many of the prisoners tried at York rested their defence on stories, which depended for their credibility on the fact, that work was superabundant.

It is now time to close these preliminary remarks, and to proceed to the report of the Trials. But there shall be first given an alphabetical list of the 64 Prisoners delivered out of York Castle upon this occasion; which, by containing a statement of their residences, occupations, and ages, and of the crimes with which they were charged, will exhibit at one view the seat of Luddism, the description of its adherents, and the offences which are immediately connected with it, or are consequential on it; and by containing the result as to each prisoner, with a reference to the relevant page, will serve as an index to the book.

EXECUTION OF THE LUDDITES AT YORK

A Number of these misguided men, who had long kept the northern parts of the kingdom in alarm, by the most atrocious excesses, were at length brought to condign punishment.

A special commission was issued for their trial, and which was opened by Baron Thompson at the city of York, on Monday the 4th of January, 1813, in a most impressive charge to the Grand Jury.

On Tuesday, the 5th, the Court proceeded upon the trial of John Swallow, John Batley, Joseph Fletcher, and John Lamb, for a burglary and felony in the house of Mr. Samuel Moxon, at Whitley Upper: the jury pronounced them all Guilty.

The system of atrocity pursued by the Luddites being known to every individual, we hold it needless to enter into a detail of the evidence addressed against then, which, throughout the whole of the important trials, were nearly to the same effect—administering false oaths,—riotously assembling—destroying the frames and looms of manufacturers of cloth, breaking into houses, robbery, and murder. We shall, however, proceed more particularly to state the cases marked with blood.

On Wednesday, George Mellor, of Longroyd Bridge, William Thorp, and Thomas Smith of Huddersfield, were indicted for the wilful murder of Wm. Horsfall, of Marsden, merchant and manufacturer, at Lockwood, in the West Riding of the County of York.

It appeared from the evidence of John Armitage, who keeps a public house at Crossland Moor, called the Warren House, that Mr. Horsfall had, on the 28th of April, been at Huddersfield market, and on his return called at witness's house about a quarter past six in the evening; and got a glass of rum and water, treated two persons who were there, paid his reckoning and rode away—did not stop 20 minutes at witness's; nor did he get off his horse. Between witness's house and Marsden, there is a plantation belonging to Mr. Radcliffe, and about a quarter of a mile from Warren House. About seven o'clock, witness heard that Mr. Horsfall had been shot. Witness and the two persons whom the deceased had been treating went out together and found Mr. Horsfall about twenty or thirty yards below the plantation, sitting on the road side, bleeding very much. They got him down to the Warren-house as soon as they could. Mr. Horsfall died there.

Henry Parr was at Huddersfield on the 28th of April last; was upon the road between Huddersfield and Marsden; and, after he had passed the Warren-house, heard the report of fire-arms; saw a person riding before him; report seemed to come from Mr. Radcliffe's plantation; saw smoke arising at the same time, and four persons were in the plantation in dark coloured clothes; the person who was before witness on horseback, after the report, fell down on the horse's chine, and the horse turned round as quick as possible; Mr. Horsfall raised himself by the horses's mane, and called out, "Murder." As soon as he called out murder, one of the four men got on the wall with one hand and two feet, and Parr called out, Have you got enough yet; and he (Parr) set off to Mr. Horsfall at full gallop. Mr. H. said, "Good man, you are a stranger to me; I'm shot," Mr. Horsfall grew sick; and blood began to flow from his side. Mr. H. desired witness to go to Mrs, Horsfall's.

Bannister, a clothier, met Parr on the road, who told witness that Mr. Horsfall was shot. Witness found Mr. H. on the road-side very bloody.

Mr. Horton, surgeon, gave his testimony professionally— he extracted a ball from the deceased, and found several wounds in his body, and had no doubt they were the cause of his death.

Benjamin Walker, an accomplice, stated that the prisoners, George Mellor and Thomas Smith, worked with him at Wood's; and, in a conversation about the attack on Mr. Cartwright's mill, Mellor said there was no way to break the shears—but shoot the master. Mellor had a loaded pistol, and said he must go with him to shoot Mr. Horsfall. The pistol was loaded. Witness and the three prisoners went to the plantation. Smith had a pistol, which he shewed to the witness. Smith and Walker went together, and got to the plantation first—Thorp and Mellor came afterwards. George Mellor ordered witness and Smith to fire, if they missed Mr. Horsfall; witness did not fire, but heard Mellor say Mr. Horsfall was coming, and soon after heard the report of a pistol; they waited at a short distance till the job was done.

The prisoners attempted to prove an *alibi*.

The jury withdrew about 25 minutes, and returned a verdict of Guilty against all the prisoners.

On Friday these wretched men were brought to the place of execution behind the Castle at York. Every precaution had been taken to render a rescue impracticable. Two troops of cavalry were drawn up near the front of the platform, and the avenues to the Castle were guarded by infantry.

A few minutes before nine o'clock, the prisoners came upon the platform. After the Ordinary had read the accustomed forms of prayer, George Mellor prayed for about ten minutes. William Thorp also prayed; but his voice was not so well heard. Smith said but little, but seemed to join in the devotion with great seriousness.

The prisoners were then moved to the front of the platform; and, after saying a few words, the executioner proceeded to perform his fatal office, and the drop fell.

On the 8th, John Baines the elder, John Baines the younger, Zachary Baines, of the same family, the elder near seventy years of age, and the latter scarce sixteen, John Eadon, Charles Milnes, William Blakeborough, and George Duckworth, all of Halifax, were tried for administering an unlawful oath to John Macdonald; and all, except the boy, were found guilty.

January 9.—James Haigh, of Dalton, Jonathan Deane, of Huddersfield, John Ogden, James Brook, Thomas Brook, John Walker, of Longroyd Bridge, and John Hirst, of Liversedge, were tried for attacking the mill of Mr. William Cartwright, at Rawfolds. Mr. C. being apprehensive of an attack being made upon his mill, procured the assistance of five soldiers; and retired to rest about twelve o'clock, and soon afterwards heard the barking of a dog. Mr. C. arose; and, while opening the door, heard a breaking of windows, and also a firing in the upper and lower windows, and a violent hammering at the door. Mr. C. and his men flew to their arms; a bell placed at the top of the mill, for the purpose of alarming the neighbours, being rung by one of his men, the persons inside the mill discharged their pieces from loop-holes. The fire was returned regularly on both sides. The mob called out, "Bang up lads, in with you, keep close; d——n that bell, get to it, damn 'em, kill 'em all." The numbers assembled were considerable. The attack continued about 20 minutes. The fire slackened from without; and they heard the cries of the wounded. The men that were wounded were taken care of. They afterwards died. One of the accomplices, W. Hall, was one of those connected with Mellor and Thorp, and assembled with many other persons, by the desire of Mellor, in a field belonging to Sir George Armitage, Bart. on the night of the 11th of April last. They called their numbers, remained there some time, and then marched off: Hall's number was seven. Mellor commanded the musket company, another the pistol company, and another the hatchet company: they were formed in lines of ten each. Two of the men were to go last, and drive up the rear.—Some had hatchets, some hammers, some sticks, and others had nothing.

Another accomplice gave a similar testimony.

The jury found James Haigh, J. Dean, John Ogden, Thomas Brook, and John Walker, Guilty—James Brook, John Brook, and John Hirst, Not Guilty.

January 11.—J. Hay, John Hill, and William Hartley, were next tried for a burglary in the house of Mr. George Haigh, of Sculcoates; and found Guilty.

On Thursday the Grand Jury, after stating they had no more bills before them, inquired if any more were prepared.—Mr. Parke said—"I shall, with leave of the Court, answer the question put by the Grand Jury." Their Lordships intimated assent, and Mr. Parke 'proceeded:—"My learned friends and myself have examined the different cases which have been presented to you; and, considering that many of these people have acted under the influence of other persons, we have, in the exercise of that discretion confided to us by the Crown, declined, at present, to present any other bills before you, and I hope this lenity will produce its proper effects; and that the persons on whom it is exercised, will prove themselves, by their future good conduct, deserving of it. But if it be abused, proceedings against them can be resumed."

January 12,—James Hay, Joseph Crowther, and N. Hayle, were found guilty of taking from James Brook, a promissory note of one pound, and some silver and copper coin.

Several prisoners, were, through the, lenity of government, admitted to bail, on their entering into recognizances, the prisoners in 200l. each, and their bail in 100l. each.

Mr. Baron Thomson then passed sentence on the prisoners.—Fifteen were sentenced to death; six to be transported for seven years; sixteen were discharged on bail; and sixteen were discharged without bail.

On Saturday, the following malefactors convicted before mentioned were also brought to the same place of execution, at different times, viz. at eleven in the forenoon, John Hill, Joseph Crowther, N. Hayle, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, Thomas Brook, and John Walker, were placed upon the scaffold. Many of them, after the clergyman had repeated, "The Lord have mercy upon you," in a very audible voice articulated, "I hope he will." The bodies, after hanging till twelve o'clock, were then cut down.

At half-past one o'clock, John Swallow, John Batley, Joseph Fisher, William Hartley, James Haigh, James Hey, and Job Hay, were also executed. The conduct of the prisoners was becoming their awful situation.

Sussex Advertiser - Monday 01 February 1813

Our Huddersfield Correspondent under yesterday's date, says—"That this week the tenters of Mr. Joseph Mellor, Dungeon, near Huddersfield, one of the witnesses against the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, have been cut, and a piece of cloth in the shape of a heart, which had been cut from them, pricked full of holes, and hung on the latch of his door, with an inscription upon it, "Blood for blood, says General Ludd," and an intimation that his heart should soon be in the same situation. These infatuated men seem bent on their own destruction. (Leeds Mercury)

By His Royal Highness The PRINCE of WALES, REGENT of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
in the Name and on the Behalf of HIS MAJESTY.

A PROCLAMATION.

GEORGE P. R.

WHEREAS We have beheld, with the deepest Regret, the daring Outrages committed in those Parts of England wherein some of the most important Manufactures of the Realm have been for a long Time carried on: And being firmly persuaded that such Outrages have been, in a great Degree, occasioned by the wicked Misrepresentations and Artifices of ill-designing Persons, who have deluded the ignorant and unwary, through the specious Pretext of procuring additional Employment and increased Wages for the labouring Manufacturers, by the Destruction of the various Kinds of Machinery now most beneficially employed in the Manufactures of this Kingdom, and have thus seduced them to enter into unlawful Associations, and to bind their Consciences by Oaths and Engagements not less injurious to their own Welfare, than destructive of the good Order and Happiness of Society; and seeing that the Extent and Progress of the Trade and Manufactures of this Country, which have been continually advanced by the Invention and Improvement of Machinery, afford the best practical Demonstration of the Falsehood of all such Pretexts; WE, therefore, acting in the Name and on the Behalf of His Majesty, being anxious by every Means in Our Power to bring back His Majesty's misguided Subjects to a just Sense of their own individual Interests, as well as of their Duty to His Majesty, and of the Regard which they owe to the Welfare of the Community, HAVE thought fit, by the Advice of His Majesty's Privy Council, to issue this Proclamation; and We do hereby, in the Name and on the Behalf of His Majesty, exhort all His Majesty's loving Subjects strenuously to exert themselves in their several Stations to prevent the Recurrence of those atrocious Combinations and Crimes, by which the public Peace has been so long disturbed, and the Persons and Property of Individuals endangered and destroyed, and which have so justly drawn down upon the Offenders the severest Penalties of the Law. AND We do more especially warn those, who may be exposed to such Seductions, against the Danger of binding themselves by illegal Oaths and Engagements to obey the Commands of secret Directors, who, keeping themselves aloof, involve their deluded Associates in all the Guilt and Peril of Violence, Robbery, and Murder. AND We do further, in the Name and on the Behalf of His Majesty, earnestly recommend and enjoin His Majesty's loving Subjects, whenever it shall be found necessary, to have Recourse to the salutary Measures which the Wisdom of Parliament has provided for the Protection of Persons and Property. AND We do further exhort the Proprietors of Machinery, not to be deterred from continuing the Use and Employment of the same, but vigilantly and strenuously to exert themselves in the Maintenance and Defence of their Property, and in the Prosecution of their lawful and meritorious Callings, in the full Persuasion that due Watchfulness and Resolution, exhibited in the first Instance on their own Part, will, as has been proved by recent Experience, most effectually prevent or repel such unlawful Aggressions. AND We do, further, in the Name and on the Behalf of His Majesty, charge and command all Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Mayors, Bailiffs, Constables and other Civil
Officers, to continue their utmost Vigilance and Activity for the Preservation of Peace and good Order, the Prevention of Nightly and other unlawful Meetings of ill-designing and wicked Men, and for the Defence of His Majesty's peaceable and industrious Subjects from the secret Machinations and open Attacks of the Violators of Private Property, and the Disturbers of the Public Tranquillity: Trusting, as We do, that by the constant and active Exertions of all well-disposed Men, the Misguided may be reclaimed, and the Mischievous kept in Awe, without the Necessity of recurring to the Chastisements of the Law, which
it will be Our Duty, as Guardian of the general Peace and Prosperity of the Realm, strictly to enforce, if unhappily the Renewal of such Atrocities, as We have lately had to deplore, should again call for the Infliction of just and exemplary Punishment.

Given at the Court at Carlton House, this First Day of February 1813, in the 53d Year of His Majesty's Reign.
GOD Save The KING.
