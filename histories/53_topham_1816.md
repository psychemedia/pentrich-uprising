# Benjamin Topham's Frames Broken Again

After 1812, there were several years of relative calm, interspersed by only occasional attacks. But with midsummer, 1816, approaching, reports in newspapers across England brought news of a resurgence of frame-breaking in and around Nottingham.

A private letter from Nottingham, dated on Sunday, says, "the system of frame breaking re-commenced this morning about two o'clock; nineteen lace frames were broken at New Radford, near this town, working to Waynman; nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different people. There was an armed party, upwards of thirty, and sentinels placed at different avenues, whilst the work of destruction went forward."

The News (London) - Sunday 16 June 1816

PROVINCIAL NEWS

THE LUDDITES.—We are informed that the Luddites in the vicinity of Nottingham have again resumed their mischievous practices of frame-breaking. The following is an extract of a letter from Nottingham, dated Sunday last, on this unpleasant subject:—

"I am sorry to inform you, that the system of frame-breaking recommenced this morning about two o'clock: nineteen lace-frames were broken at New Radford, near this town, working to Waynman; nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different people. The cause assigned for destroying these frames is, that he had just sold nine to the workmen, to be worked out by stopping one-third of the work. There was an armed party, upwards of thirty, and sentinels placed at different avenues, whilst the work of destruction went forward. I have just seen W————, and, from what he says, there are great hopes they will be found out; but one of our magistrates has behaved very ill, in refusing to grant a warrant, being Sunday. There will be no security for property in our business, or any other, until the law is clearly defined, that the county, hundred, or district, *shall* make good all property wantonly or maliciously destroyed: and as the system is spreading to so many parts of the kingdom, we are surprised that the Home Secretary of State should not see it would take away every motive of revenge against personal property."
```

A more complete report of the events of the previous weekend can be found in the *Leicester Chronicle* reveals that the owner of three of the frames was a manufacturer who had suffered at the hands of the Luddites several times previously: *Benjamin Topham*.

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 15 June 1816

*Daring Outrage.*—On Saturday night last, about one o'clock, a party of men, disguised and armed with various sorts of weapons, forced the door of Mr. William Wright, of New Radford, when about seven of them, having obtained a light, rushed up stairs into the workshop, or shops, where they demolished twelve point net lace-frames; and with such vengeance did they exercise their lawless authority, that the frames, which were principally of superior worth, are rendered of very little value. It is very singular, that three of these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago, in his shop, at that village, along with a number more, two of which have made very little work, and the other none since they were repaired. One of the other frames belongs to Mrs. Platts of Nottingham, four to Mr. Wright, and three to Mr. Waynman, lace-manufacturer of Nottingham, who is Mr. Wright's principal employer, and one to Mr. Cole, lace-manufacturer. The loss thus occasioned must be very great; but this is not all, for the depredators, not content with the mischief thus done, very materially damaged or destroyed (principally the latter) about thirty-one yards of net which was upon the frames, and took away six yards. The clock face in the house was struck with great violence with a hammer, and the corner cupboard was beat in pieces. Mr. Wright was from home. Mrs. Wright and family were kept in their respective rooms while the mischief was going on, but, as these nightly violators of property and domestic repose had twice to go down stairs for a light, the guarded parties had opportunity of seeing them, and they agree in stating that seven men were in the shop, while Mrs. Wright thinks she saw twelve men that stood watch on the outside. — When the *workmen*, as those, we understand, are called that actually do the mischief, had completed their purpose at Mr. Wright's, they immediately went in the house of Mr. Mullen, close by, the door of which they broke into pieces, and then rushed up into the workshop, where they demolished seven point net lace frames, six of which belonged to Mr. Waynman above named, and one to Mr. Mullen—one was left uninjured, and is generally understood, from the watchword of alarm being given from without. They also took from Mr. Mullen's, fifteen yards of net and a shirt, and left an instrument behind them like a tomahawk; they also broke the clock. It is proper to state, that the depredators, in order to render their mischief more complete, broke many of the globes, which contain a mixture of water and aquafortis, and which are used by the workmen in winter evenings to add to the brilliancy of their light, and cast the corroding contents upon the frames. — It seems singular, that neither Mr. Mullen nor his wife heard them; the reason assigned is this, which is a very feasible one, and, from the respectability of Mr. Mullen's character, is universally believed—he had more liquor than he usually takes in an evening, which caused him to sleep very soundly, as he had been in bed about an hour: and Mrs. Mullen, who was also asleep in bed, is very hard of hearing. When these daring offenders had completed the object of their violence, they discharged several pistols — shouted, as though in triumph, and then retired. Two persons are in custody on suspicion.

A couple of weeks later, two men had been committed for taking part in the attack: *Thomas Glover* and *John Chettle*.

Stamford Mercury - Friday 28 June 1816

On Saturday se'nnight *Thomas Glover* and *John Chettle* were committed to Nottingham county gaol, for trial at the next assizes, charged with being concerned breaking frames at Radford, on the 8th instant.
```

The men came to trial at the Nottinghamshire Summer Assizes, in early August, in front of Baron Graham; they were defended by a man we might think of, at this time, as the Luddite's counsel: *Mr. Thomas Denman*.

In defence, the two men each offered their own, and different, alibis. Chettle's came from a woman named Catherine Shaw, who had seen him walking home in the early hours of the morning when the attack was supposed to have been taking place; Glover's was by way of attendees at a party he had happened to have organised for that very night.

Nottingham Assize Intelligence

Trial of Glover and Chettle for Frame Breaking

Saturday, August 3, 1816

About half-past one o'clock this day, THOMAS GLOVER and JOHN CHETTLE, were put to the bar. These two men had been arraigned in the morning, and pleaded not guilty to the three indictments preferred against them. The first indictment charged them with having, on the night of the 8th day of June last, at the parish of Radford, in the county of Nottingham, together with divers persons yet unknown, with force and arms, entered the dwelling-house of William Wright, and wilfully and maliciously broken and destroyed four lace frames, the property of the said William Wright, and eight other frames in the same dwelling-house then and there being, without consent of the said William Wright. The second indictment charged them with stealing two pieces of lace, the property of the said William Wright; and the third, couched in nearly the same terms as the first, charged them with breaking seven frames in the house of Thomas Mullen, all on the night of the 8th day of June last. The prisoners were now put to the bar on the first of these charges; and after the jury had been resworn, and the witnesses for the prisoners ordered out of court,

*Mr. Clark* leading counsel for the prosecution, then called the witnesses:—

*Eliza Wright* (examined by Mr. Reader) is the daughter of William Wright, a lace manufacturer, in New Radford—her father was not at home in the evening of the 8th of June—the family consisted of her mother, herself, her sister Ann, her sister Kezinha, three young children, and an apprentice girl, Hannah Lane—about a quarter before one was alarmed by hearing many persons before the door, and passing by; her mother, sister, servant, and the children were in bed; she alone was left up in the house; the door and windows were all fast. Witness went upstairs, and immediately heard a loud knock at the door, followed with a large stick or hammer; she shrieked out and called her mother—heard many folks go upstairs, into the workshops over the room where she slept. Her mother slept up another pair of stairs, though it was on the same floor as the room in which she slept; there were three shops up stairs, all connected or communicating together. Witness soon afterwards heard the breaking of the frames; believed the men staid in the room about twenty minutes—while the men were in the shop her sister went up to and looked out at the window of the chamber in which they were—heard no voice call that she can recollect—it was not until three or four o'clock that she went up to the shops, when she found all the frames broken, but does not recollect how many frames were in the shop—was greatly alarmed during the time the men were in the house.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Denman, counsel for the prisoners*: there was an aunt in the family; does not know her name, though her own aunt and lives with them; she is generally called aunt Kitty; was in the house at the time, and was extremely frightened, but did not go into fits, though she was very near it, and her aunt's extreme distress took up much of their attention—there was only one step between her room and her mother's—her aunt Kitty slept with her mother—when she came down stairs, the clock face was bruised, and the glass broken; it did not go then, for it had been stopped by some violence done to it.

*William Wright* (examined by Mr. Clarke) is a lace manufacturer, and carried on his business on the 8th day of June last, at New Radford; he had twelve frames in his house; four of them were his own, three belonging to William Wayman, of Nottingham, three to Benjamin Topham, of Pentridge, one to Mrs. Platts, a widow woman, and one to Mr. Cole—they were all frames to make point-net lace on; seven of them were at work, and five stood still—the house in which he lived was built for and had formerly been three houses, and the frames stood in the three workshops over the three houses—the workshops communicated one with another—witness went from home on Saturday, and returned on Monday the 10th of June—the frames were all safe and perfect when he went from home; when he came back, all the twelve were demolished, apparently with an axe, or something of that description—a person came over to Grantham to let him know of the destruction of his property—the jack-wires of the frames were drawn out, and some of them broken and thrown about the room—the frames were quite incapable of being again used—knows the two prisoners very well; Chettle lived on the right hand side of Chapel-street, witness lived on the left—does not know how long Chettle may have lived there, but above two years; ever since witness went to reside in that street—has known Glover four years—Glover lived fronting the gardens, about five hundred yards from witness's house.

*Ann Wright* was the daughter of the last witness, went to bed at a quarter before one by their clock, but the clock was half an hour too fast, leaving her sister Eliza and Hannah Lane up in the house—went to bed without a light, thinking her sister would follow her—soon went to sleep, but was awoke by a chopping at the door, and her sister shrieking—by the sound she conceived it was an hatchet with which the door was struck—jumped out of bed, and heard blows at the door for two or three minutes; ran to the chamber door and shrieked out "murder"—heard her mother's voice on the stairs, her mother said "Eliza" or "lasses," she could not distinguish which, "what's the matter"—witness stood still with the chamber door open some time—her mother went away, and the dog and the men made such a noise, that she did not hear what her mother said further—her mother was below—"I heard men speaking but did not hear what they said—but I heard after some of them say, 'men, there are two of you forgetting your voices,' this voice appeared to come from the street, from the street door; my chamber faced the street—my sister Eliza said 'that's Chettle, never mind,' I said it was Chettle and all" (a very common phrase for also)—witness thought then she knew the voice; had known Chettle eight or nine years, and was well acquainted with his voice—witness then went to the window, turned the curtain aside, and opened the sash five or six inches—she saw Thomas Glover, one of the prisoners at the bar, walking about; appeared to be walking to Waynman's yard end, about twenty yards off—he walked backwards and forwards before the door, and had on a light great-coat, with the collar tied up to his chin by a handkerchief—she then saw John Chettle go up to him from her father's door—Chettle was in a dark great-coat, tied up to the chin in the same manner as Glover's—she had a good opportunity of seeing their faces, three separate times—cannot say whether there was a light, she saw no light—"it was a dark moonlight night, although it was going to rain." Chettle and Glover talked together for a few minutes—Chettle returned towards their door, and shouted "don't you break the globes, you've done enough," at this time John Chettle and Thomas Glover, the two prisoners at the bar, looked up, and she had a good opportunity of seeing their faces—at that period there appeared to her a sound from above like the smashing of iron, as if the frames were breaking—witness had known both Glover and Chettle eight or nine years; she dare say she knew them as well as her own father; has no doubt at all of their identity; is sure it was them. To Chettle's call respecting the globes, the men above replied, "O d——n them, we have not done half enough yet," and there was a smashing of glass, as if the globes were breaking, in an instant—witness then went to the chamber door, and heard a sound as though a man was coming up stairs, she directly crept under the bed, and her sister Eliza blowed out the candle, and dropped the candlestick on the floor—when she thought the man was gone down, she got from under the bed, and went to the chamber window again. Thomas Glover was still walking about; in a few minutes he returned again towards their door, and when about half way, he met Chettle coming from the door—they talked together a few minutes—there was a light from the shops above her, a reflection against the wall opposite, by which she saw their faces—both put their hands before their mouths, and shouted, "Ned, Bill, and Joe, you're in danger;" the men in the shops replied, "who dare face us while we've pistol and shot"—the men seemed to her as if they immediately proceeded to the third shop—the middle shop is over her room—Glover and Chettle shouted again, and said, "Ned, you're in danger"—she heard a smashing in the third shop before this was shouted —the men above called out that they had had ale, and would have more yet— the men staid in the shop two or three minutes longer, and then came down stairs; when they were in the street, heard them fire two pieces, she saw about twenty men go down the street. Witness went up stairs into the shop at about a quarter of an hour after, and saw that the twelve frames were broken, the carrying bars, and other parts of the frames were lying about the room— is quite sure that she was not mistaken about the persons of the prisoners.

*Hannah Lane* was the next witness sworn on the part of the prosecution. Was apprentice to William Wright; when she had been in bed about a quarter of an hour on the night in question, she was awoke by a noise like that of iron falling— she slept over the shops, and goes up a ladder to the room; when she heard the men breaking the frames, she came down five steps of the ladder, and saw the light of a small candle, and three men in the first shop; one of the men perceiving her, pointed a pistol to her, and said, if she did not go back, he would blow her brains out; saw something like a coal hammer in one of the other's hands; the light went out soon after, and one of them went down stairs; they told him he might poke for a light; but shortly called to him, and said, they had got a lamp, and could do without it. When the men were gone, she went into the shops, and saw all the frames broken; she saw a bunch of matches lying on the floor but did not pick them up.

Mr. Denman declined cross-examining this witness.

*Mary Wright*, wife of William Wright, stated that she left her daughter Eliza and Hannah Lane below when she went to bed; in a little time afterwards heard persons at the door, and a great noise; she thought at first it was her daughter, and went and called to her; when the men had got into the house, came up the stairs, close to her room door; she heard the breaking of the iron when the men had got into the rooms above; her window looked into the turnpike-road, the Alfreton turnpike-road; her daughter's window looked into Chapel-street; their's was a corner house; plainly heard a noise at Mullen's door. Witness was on the stairs when the men forced an entrance, but instantly went into her room, shut the door, threw up the sash of the window, and called out "Murder!" intending to alarm Mullens, who lived at the next door; when she had opened the window, she saw twelve men, a pistol was snapped at her, it only flashed in the pan, it did not go off; one of the men d-———d her, and bid her shut the window, but before she had time to obey the command, a number of stones were thrown, which broke five panes of glass. She heard a voice proceeding from the workshops, "Ned, bring a light," three separate times; and from the bottom of the stairs there was a call "Ned, you're in danger!" the men did not cease then but went into the third shop; "Ned, you're in danger!" being very soon called again, they came down immediately; when the men had got into the street, she distinctly heard two pieces fired, and saw the flashes; she thought she saw another flash, but is not quite certain.— When she went down stairs, she found two pannels of the door, and the lock broken. Witness produced, in court, a quantity of the lace which was on the frames at the time they were broken; the lace was full of holes. The damage done to their own property, in lace and frames, was computed at 260*l.* 10*s.* independent of the damage done to the frames which did not belong to them.

Here the case for the prosecution ended.

Baron Graham having called upon the prisoners for their defence,

*John Chettle* declared, in a very emphatic manner, that he was an innocent man, and never did any one a "*halfpeth*" of injury in his life. He left his defence to his counsel.

*Thomas Glover* also said he was innocent of the crime laid to his charge, and he left his defence to his counsel.

The Learned Judge informed them that their counsel could not speak for them, he could only call and examine the witnesses; if they had any thing to say, they must say it for themselves.

The prisoners having declined saying any thing further,

Mr. Denman proceeded to call the witnesses, and the first witness that was sworn, was

*Mary Anne Wakerley*, who lives in Lamb's-buildings, Broad-lane, and occupies a room there, which is the next room to Jemima Hague's. Witness saw the prisoner Chettle in the course of the evening of the 8th of July; he came to her room at eight o'clock, and remained there about three quarters of an hour; he then went away, and returned about eleven o'clock; witness was not then in her own room, but in Jemima Hague's room; and did not return to her own room, till two o'clock in the morning; had no supper; there was a bit of a merrymaking, and a little ale; there was nothing else. The merrymaking was on account of her son having lately come from soldiering. Her son was there that night, as well as William Ash, Francis Poyner, and Ann Jervis; these were all present at the merrymaking—Chettle drank some ale with them, and after a little time fell asleep, and remained in that state the whole of the night till two o'clock; she let him sleep as long as she conveniently could, on account of his lameness, he had a little time before, broken his leg; she heard the clock strike two on going to her own room, and came and waked him herself; being very fresh at the time, had something to do to make him sensible, he went home; this was about a quarter after two; is quite positive he never left the room from eleven till two; is sure the clock struck two before she awoke him; recollects the day very well, for she heard of the frame-breaking the day after, being Sunday.

*Re-examined by Mr. Denman.*—Chettle pays for the three children he has by her; they were on the Saturday night in Jemima Hague's room—she could trust Chettle more safely by himself at two o'clock than she could before, because it then began to get light.

William Barrows knows Chettle very well; did not hear of the frame-breaking till Monday. Witness is a publican, and keeps the Cross Keys, in Nottingham— Chettle came to his house about nine o'clock or a little after, and staid there till about eleven.

Wm. Ash, Jemima Hague, Frederick Wakerley, Ann Jervis, Francis Poyner, Ann Dix, and Wm. Price, corroborated the evidence of the last witness, particularly as to seeing Chettle about two o'clock in Wakerley's room.

Catherine Shaw lives in Back-lane, in the way from Lamb's-building, to New Radford; her residence is about a quarter of a mile from Wright's house; saw the prisoner Chettle on Sunday morning; she was washing the children's things, in order that they might be ready to go to the Sunday School in the morning; had occasion to empty the suds into the street; it was then getting daylight; saw a person come up the lane, as far off as she could see; he was coming up the lane towards New Radford; when he got towards her, she knew it to be John Chettle; she talked to him five or six minutes; he was very tipsy; he went, when she parted with him towards New Radford; she heard the quarter jacks of one of the town's clocks strike, just before Chettle came, it went a quarter past two; she went to look, and found it a little faster. Witness knows Ann Wright, believes Ann Wright is not to be believed on her oath.

*Richard Parker* knows the Odd Fellows Arms public-house, at New Radford; he was there on the evening in question; the house is kept by Mr. Cooper; witness was in the tap-room, and there were about half a dozen people present; three countrymen sat on the right hand side of the room —there was a party in the parlour, as he understood, a party of watermen (water-carriers;)—saw Thomas Glover come into the kitchen about nine o'clock; he sat in front of the kitchen; went out in about an hour, and came in again in twenty minutes; brought some steaks in his hand, which were ordered to be cooked; they were cooked accordingly, and brought on the table, and eaten—the persons who partook were Glover, himself, Langton, Booth, Husband, Elliott, Gamble, and Wheatley;—every one paid for his bread. Witness had Glover in view most of the night—Glover never was absent while he stood there, more than a minute when he went out—when witness got home, it wanted about a quarter to two; went straight home—lives only about 200 yards, from the public-house, and the same distance from Wright's; the reason he knows it was about a quarter to two is, he has a clock in his shop, which he always draws up on Saturday night, he drew it up as soon as he got home—the waiter at the public-house wanted them to go at 12 o'clock, but the company did not then depart.

*Mary Cooper* is the landlady of the Odd Fellows Arms public-house—Glover was in the tap-room on the night of the 8th of June.—Mr. Cooper, her husband, was unwell, and sent early to bed—she refused either to serve their party or the watermen, after 12 o'clock, and had seen him at 10. Witness was not constantly in the room—after ten o'clock they departed. She cannot say that Glover never went out after 11 till two; but she never saw him go out.

*Mary Goddard* was a servant in the house, and was waiting that night on the tap-room company—saw Glover there; she was employed taking liquor in all the night—Glover came in with the stakes about ten o'clock, and never left the tap-room, only to go to the door; he was never absent above two or three minutes—in the course of the night she went out the back way for water, and heard a great noise and a pistol go off; she came back immediately, and the company were all in the house—her mistress was frequently urging both companies to go, but could not get them to go in a reasonable time, nor till two o'clock, in the morning, by their clock.

*Cross-examined*—Witness went out for the water about one o'clock, into the brewhouse—did not mention what she had heard to the company in the house, though she was so frightened as to run in without the water—some of the company went to the door, but of course she did not follow them—Glover went to the door, but never was out more than two or three minutes, cannot say exactly how often nor how long; once in the course of the night, when she went to the door, a man came by with a great coat on, and his hat slouched as though he wished to hide his face; she heard a great smash, like the smashing of slates, but never mentioned it that night. Glover might go out three or four times—three or four minutes was the longest time Glover could be absent she believes.

*Cross-examined*—Glover was dressed as usual; the bar is next to the street, and she heard no noises.

*Joshua Wheatley* is a framework-knitter; he was present; a treat was given that night by Glover, on account of his going to work in a twist machine of Mr. Kirkland's—witness never lost sight of Glover, nor saw him go to the door; he sat within three or four persons of Glover, and is sure Glover was present when the party broke up a few minutes before two o'clock.

*Cross examined by Mr. Clarke.*—Witness will swear that Glover never went to the door—neither did he. Witness and Glover sat near together, and he never lost sight of him—he sat near the window; heard no noise except some like the shake of the window.

*James Oakley* was invited by Glover that night to his treat—sat next to Glover nearly the whole of the time.—Glover never left the room, he will swear that—he left the house near upon two o'clock—Glover was then present.

*Thomas Amatt* was at Cooper's house that night; Glover never left the house from the time witness joined the party, till he departed; had Glover gone out, he must have passed by, and disturbed witness.

Simeon Barratt, Samuel Husband and George Green, were also at Cooper's, and saw Glover there about two o'clock.

*Thomas Gibson* knows Ann Wright; saw her at a quarter before two on Sunday afternoon, at the corner of her own house; she took him into the shop, and he asked her if she knew any of the offenders; she said no she did not; her sister Eliza was unlacing her boots in the house when they came to the door.

*Ann Wright* was again called, and declared she never said her sister was unlacing her boots in the house.

*Thomas Gibson* will positively swear that Ann Wright told him her sister Eliza was unlacing her boots in the house when the men came to the door; she mentioned to him that she and her sister Eliza ran up stairs; she did not know any of them, for she was under the bed all the time.

*William Leighton*, a cordwainer, remembers seeing Ann Wright on Sunday about eight in the morning. He said to her, "What! Ann, you have had Ned Ludd at your house?" She answered, "Aye, that we have." He said "Do you know any of them;" and she answered, "No! I was ever d——d frightened for that, by God!" Witness has known her for more than seven years, and does not believe that she is to be believed on her oath.

Q. Is not Mr. Smith one of the gang, one of the committee?

A. I do not know what you mean, Sir.

Q. Will you swear you don't know what is meant by the committee?

A. Yes, I will.—(Hisses from the spectators in the hall.)

Adam Nelson, framework knitter, Benjamin Moore, Nathaniel Longmire, a lace manufacturer, Wm. Bostock, Francis Tealby, grocer, Wm. Willoughby, Thos. Smith, Joseph Harper, James Fisher, John Duffy, Samuel Rowland and William Hazeldine, gave Chettle and Glover good characters, as peaceable, honest and industrious men.

At about twelve o'clock, the Learned Judge proceeded to give his charge to the Jury, and recapitulated most of the evidence from memory, regretting that he could not well see by candle-light to read the notes that he had taken. Some of the most particular parts of the evidence he read, and after a few remarks, committed the case to the Jury; recommending pointedly and indeed commanding the numerous spectators not to make any sign of approbation or disapprobation, let the verdict be whatever it might.

The Jury, after a consultation of about twenty minutes, said they had not sufficient evidence of the guilt of the prisoners, and therefore in a formal manner gave in their verdict.—Thomas Glover not guilty,—John Chettle not guilty.

On the verdict being announced, the spectators gave three times three huzza's and paraded the streets shouting and rejoicing for some hours. The court did not break up till about two o'clock on Sunday morning.

On Monday morning, at nine o'clock, the court again assembled, when the prisoners were put to the bar on the other two indictments, but Mr. Reader declined to call any evidence on either of the charges, the Jury of course under the direction of Baron Graham returned a verdict of Not Guilty.

The Learned Judge made an eloquent and sensible address to the two men who had thus been pronounced not guilty. He told them that as they were discharged by the verdict of their country, he did not design to deprive them of any benefit which that verdict conferred upon them. Nevertheless, he must say, there was, for it had been undoubtedly proved on this trial, there was something of a system in this great and populous town, of attacking the property of those persons who may in any manner have offended the lower orders; there was a conspiracy the foulest of all conspiracies, he did not mean to say it was so in this case, but such conspiracies led to perjury of the blackest die. The Learned Judge wished to impress their minds, and the minds of all who were present, with the danger of such conspiracies—it could not be endured in a land of law, in a land of liberty that property should be destroyed in such a manner; the law must have its course, for there could be no liberty if men could not be safe at their own homes, if the law could not protect them at their own firesides. He would say, not only to the prisoners, but to all who heard him, be cautious of engaging in such things; certainly offenders might for a time evade the vigilance of the law, but he would have them recollect that the law was founded in wisdom, and supported by a force which could not be overcome; the only way for men to be happy, was, to be peaceable and honest, and without these, there could be no happiness. He did not wish to be the instrument of their destruction, but while he filled the situation in which he was placed, he must and would be, the strenuous supporter of the law. He trusted this would be a lesson for them and their children, and that walking in the paths of justice and honesty, they would secure to themselves happiness both in this world and that which is to come.

```

An even more comprehensive report of the trial was given in the *Nottingham Review*, including the testimony of the witnesses mentioned *en passim* in the *Leicester Chronicle* report, although it is too long, and rather too repetitive, to include in full here.

However, it does, rather usefully, describe the opening statement by the prosecution, in which the jury are informed that the defence to be offered will be by way of *alibi*, which is an inherently untrustworthy form of defence. Remember, at the time, there was no time. The time was local time, church bell clock time, and it was easy to lose track of what time anything had happened because you didn't necessarily know what time it was. And it also records the defence counsel's cross-examination of the plaintiff, Mr. Wright, where Mr. Denman rather sets up the suggestion that Mr. Wright had brought the case in the hope of reward, and recompense.

The longer report in the *Nottingham Review*, on which the *Leicester Chronicle* report was based, also casts further doubt on Ann Wright's testimony.

Nottingham Assize Intelligence

Trial of Glover and Chettle for FRAME-BREAKING

Saturday, August 3, 1816

About half past one o'clock this day, THOMAS GLOVER and JOHN CHETTLE, were put to the bar. These two men had been arraigned in the morning, and pleaded not guilty to the three indictments preferred against them. The first indictment charged them with having, on the night of the 8th day of June last, at the parish of Radford, in the county of Nottingham, together with divers persons yet unknown, with force and arms, entered the dwelling house of William Wright, and wilfully and maliciously broken and destroyed therein four lace frames, the property of the said William Wright, and eight other frames, in the same dwelling-house then and there being, without the consent of the said William Wright. The second indictment charged them with stealing two pieces of lace, the property of the said William Wright. And the third, couched in nearly the same terms as the first, charged them with breaking seven frames in the house of Thomas Mullen, all on the night of the 8th day of June last. The prisoners were now put to the bar on the first of these charges; and after the jury had been resworn, and the witnesses for the prisoners ordered out of court,

MR. CLARK, leading counsel for the prosecution, addressed the jury. He observed, that this indictment charged the two prisoners with entering the house of William Wright, and destroying a number of frames, a crime which subjects the offenders to transportation for the term of fourteen years. He did not intend to make any observations on the crime itself, for the lamentable frequency of its recurrence, must have rendered it quite unnecessary. The prosecutor, Mr. Wright, was a point net lace manufacturer, in New Radford, near Nottingham. He left his house, on purposes connected with his business, on the morning of the 8th of June, leaving his family and his property all safe; he returned again on the 10th, when the little property he possessed, the hard earnings of his honest industry, was entirely destroyed by the hand of violence; four of the frames were his own, the others he rented. The Learned Counsel should now relate a few of the leading circumstances relative to the destruction of this property. On the 8th of June, about one o'clock, being Saturday night, one of the daughters of the prosecutor Wright, was alarmed by noises before and about the house; she took a candle and went to the window, plainly heard the sound of hatchets at the house door, and afterwards heard persons enter the house and destroy the frames. She heard some of these men call out for lights and timber, what they meant by the latter expression, TIMBER, he could not tell, possibly they might mean something heavy wherewith to destroy the frames. This young woman heard Chettle's voice below, she knew Chettle's voice very well, and was confident as to his voice; Glover she saw, for when she looked out at the window, he was walking about, in front of the house, as a watchman. She heard them call out, "two of you are forgetting your voices." The work of destruction continued a considerable time; Chettle came to the door, while she looked out, and spoke to Glover; the lights they had with them made their persons distinguishable; this will be spoken to positively, without any kind of doubt, but the detail of the affair would come better and more properly from the witnesses than himself, it would be sufficient on this head for him to observe, that the persons of the prisoners were well known, and would be positively sworn to. The Learned Counsel stated, that he understood the defence against the charge would be, what was generally called an *alibi*; this was a defence easily made, and very difficult indeed to detect; an hour sooner, or an hour later, or indeed half an hour sooner, or half an hour later in such cases, will frequently make all the difference, and perfectly answer the end proposed by persons who set up such a mode of defence. But he could not think such a defence would answer the end in this case, because their persons would be sworn to, as well as the voices; and their dress would be particularly described by the witnesses he should bring forward. He would especially impress upon the minds of the jury, that the inevitable consequences of such proceedings as those now about to be described, would be, to drive the trade away from the town to other parts of the country, by which means this populous town would be very materially injured, both as to its trade and its population. He would now call the witnesses.

...

WILLIAM WRIGHT, *(examined by Mr. Clarke)* is a lace-manufacturer, and carried on his business on the 8th day of June last, at New Radford; he had twelve frames in his house; four of them were his own, three belonged to William Wayman, of Nottingham, three to Benjamin Topham, of Pentridge, one to Mrs. Platts, a widow woman, and one to Mr Cole—they were all frames to make point net lace on; seven of them were at work, and five stood still. ...

*Cross examined by Mr. Denman*—witness had never said "that he cared not if all his frames were broken, for if they were he should get money for them"—knows not of any reward on conviction of the offenders—is well acquainted with a man named Barrett, Barrett worked with him—had never said he would make his daughter Eliza appear against Barrett, nor ever said any thing of the kind—there never was a reward offered for the conviction of the person or persons who broke his frames—he is no scholar.

On his re-examination, Mr. Wright stated, that the four frames had stood him to £270; therefore it was never likely he should wish them to be broken, for the sake of the reward.


...

CATHERINE SHAW lives in Back-lane, in the way from Lamb's buildings to New Radford; her residence is about a quarter of a mile from Wright's house; saw the prisoner Chettle on Sunday morning; she was washing the children's things, in order that they might be ready to go to the Sunday School in the morning; had occasion to empty the suds into the street; it was then getting daylight; saw a person come up the lane, as far off as she could see; he was coming up the lane towards New Radford; when he got towards her, she knew it to be John Chettle; she talked to him five or six minutes; he was very tipsy; he went, when she parted with him, towards New Radford; she heard the quarter jacks of one of the town's clocks strike, just before Chettle came, it went a quarter past two; she went to look at her own clock, and found it a little faster. Witness knows Ann Wright; believes Ann Wright is not to be believed on her oath.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Reader*—Had heard Ann Wright's father and mother say, at different times, in witness's house, that she was not to be believed; her own experience, and what the girls in the neighbourhood said of her, led her to form the same conclusion. Chettle had a dark coloured great coat on, buttoned, and a handkerchief tied in the usual way."

...

THOMAS AMATT is a point net hand— worked with Mr. Walcot, was at Cooper's house that night; was not at the supper— he and another person had first some ale by themselves, and afterwards they joined the party—Glover never left the house from the time witness joined the party, till he departed; had Glover gone out, he must have passed by, and disturbed witness. 

*Cross examined*—Witness lived in Chapel-street, about thirty yards from Wright's— he went to Cooper's about eleven o'clock — cannot say how many were in the tap room, perhaps five or six—in the course of the night, a woman came in, and told the company there was something wrong going on in the street, that people were going about the street in disguise—this much surprised them all, but no one moved—he never heard a gun go off–the woman who told them this, was Mrs. Lees— never asked Mrs. Lees whereabouts these men were–had no suspicion of framebreaking— they were all afraid, and durst not go out; nevertheless the woman went out; she had more courage than all of them put together—had worked with Mr. Wright, but had then left him; cannot say how long, whether three or four days, or a week, or how long; really cannot tell—was not angry at leaving Wright's, and never said, "if he did not work in the frame, who durst?"— he did not go home that night by Mr. Wright's house. 

...

THOMAS ROWLAND knows Ann Wright, and swears he saw her on Sunday morning at William Welthdales.—(Ann Wright having sworn she was not there on that morning.)

...

CHARLOTTE KING is a tambourer; her husband is a framework knitter; saw Ann Wright on Sunday morning about nine o'clock; in reply to a question as to her knowledge of any of the men, Ann Wright replied, "How the devil was it likely when her mother was holding her aunt under in fits, herself under the bed, and her sister crying." Ann Wright told her, an hatchet was left in the workshop, and she hoped there was a name upon it, for if not, they should not know who it was that had done it; witness's husband was in bed at the time the frames were broken; they live in an house adjoining to Wright's, but heard nothing of the matter till three o'clock in the morning.

...

WILLIAM WRIGHT was again called on the part of the prosecution; knows Catherine Shaw; he never told her that his daughter was a liar, and that he could not believe a word that she said; he might have said that she could not be believed as to their own family affairs, but was not in the habit of telling lies about other people's business; she is not a notorious liar; certainly has told him lies about her own concerns, same as other children; but he never said any thing about her being a liar, to any person but his wife.

JOHN FISHER knows Mr. Wright, and worked with him; Thomas Amatt also worked with Wright; had heard Amatt say, "If he had not his frame, who durst take it?" Witness works now with Mr. Wright, and believes Ann Wright is to be believed on her oath.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES. The business of primary interest at these assizes was the trials of James Croft and James Brawfield, for arson, and *Thomas Chettle* and *Thomas Glover*, for frame-breaking and burglary. The following particulars will convey a general idea of the leading facts, as they came out evidence.

...

John Chettle and Thomas Glover, *for frame-breaking*.— The prisoners were charged with having, on the night of the 8th of June last, at the parish of Radford, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling house of Wm. Wright, and therein broke and destroyed four lace frames, the property of the said Wm. Wright, and eight other frames in the same dwelling-house. They also stood charged with burglariously entering the said dwelling-house, and stealing two pieces of lace; and likewise with having, on the same night, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling-house of Thomas Mullen, in the said parish, and maliciously and feloniously broke and destroyed therein one lace frame, belonging to the said Thomas Mullen, and six other frames in the same dwelling-house. To these several counts the prisoners pleaded not guilty.— Wm. Wright and others, in their examination before the Court, gave an account of the breaking of the frames, between twelve and one o'clock on the night mentioned in the indictment, by a party of men, in disguise, who made their way into the house, chopping the door with an axe, and forcing it open. The four lace frames were in full employ. Mrs. Waynman stated the extent of the damage sustained, including the lace pieces, at £263. — Ann Wright appeared as principal witness for the prosecution. She said, that she was in bed and was alarmed the noise of some persons chopping the door open: that in her fright she "screeted out murder!" She looked out of the window and saw Chettle and Glover, whom she had known for some time; that she distinctly recognised their features and dress, by the light of the moon, and of a candle which stood in the room. She was quite certain as to their persons. That she heard Chettle say, in his own natural voice, when the men were breaking open the door, "Now you may get in;" and in going through the house, he cautioned the rest, saying to them "mind, you are forgetting your voices." The men were in the house about twenty minutes. On her cross-examination she admitted that she had told different stories about the matter, but that what she had before said was under the influence of fear.—The prisoners, in their defence, set up an *alibi*, which was supported by the testimony of a great number of witnesses. On the part of Chettle it was proved by a woman of the name Wacherley, or Waggerley, who had had children by him, that he was present with her, from 10 o'clock at night on the 8th of June, until two the next morning, in company with several other persons, who had met at a room, in Lamb's buildings, Broad Lane, in that town, to make merry on account of the return of her son, who had been just discharged from the army. J. Ash, —— Price, Frederick Wacherley, Jemima Hunt, Ann Jarvis, and another, who were of the party, corroborated this statement; which was further confirmed by Ann Dry and another, who inhabited adjoining rooms, and had seen the prisoner there at the several hours of one and two in the morning. All the witnesses agreed as to the prisoner being fresh in liquor, and that he had slept on a chair in the room from one to two hours. In addition to this, the wife of a person named Shaw, swore that she saw and spoke to Chettle, at her own door, in Back Lane, about 20 minutes past two in the morning; that he appeared quite fresh, and was going towards home, at New Radford. Witness had been washing and preparing her children's clothes, for them to go to the Sunday School in the morning, and she happened to go to the door at the moment Chettle was coming up the lane. Witness knew Ann Wright; but such was her character, that she would not believe any thing she said upon oath.— On the part of Glover, Mrs Cooper, her servant, and several other persons swore, that he was sitting in the tap-room, at the Odd Fellows' Arms public-house, New Radford, in company with four or five more, who had been partaking of a beef steak with him, from half-past nine or ten o'clock at night of the 8th of June, till two the next morning, and that they never lost sight of him.

The Learned Judge (Graham), in summing up, made some pointed remarks the nature of the evidence brought forward in favour of the prisoners; when the Jury retired, and after consulting together some time, returned a verdict of *not guilty*.

As soon as the Jury had pronounced their verdict, loud shouts of approbation were set up by the crowd assembled in and about the hall.

The trial lasted thirteen hours, and did not terminate until past two o'clock on Sunday morning.— Soon after night-fall, such was the impatience manifested by the crowd for the issue of the trial, that it was with the greatest difficulty that they were restrained from offering personal violence to the members of the Court; and insulting language was several times addressed to the Judge.

On Monday morning the prisoners were again brought up, and after a short hearing, were acquitted on the other two charges.

ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE.

...

NOTTINGHAM. Thomas Glover and John Chettle were charged upon the oath of Wm. Wright and others, with having, in company with divers other persons, on the morning the 9th of June, with force and arms entered the dwelling house of the said Wm. Wright, at Radford, and wilfully broken and destroyed 12 lace frames. Upwards of 70 witnesses were examined their trial, which occupied the Court for 13 hours; and in the end the prisoners were acquitted. They were also acquitted upon another indictment for breaking seven frames on the premises of Thomas Mullen, at Radford, and a third indictment for stealing lace upon the premises of Wright.
```

## Public Sentiment Around the Trial

The behaviour of the crowd, and the formation of an escort for the members of the judiciary, was also the focus of attention in several other reports:

Saturday morning presented a most interesting and grateful spectacle; the violent and disgraceful proceedings which are stated to have occurred during the late Assizes at Nottingham, and which were said to have intimidated the Jury, from a conscientious discharge of their duty, induced a large portion of the most respectable inhabitants of this town, to rally round the Constituted Authorities, and give their aid towards the administration of Justice. At 6 o'clock between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange, each receiving a white wand and a club, and headed by the Chief Magistrate, proceeded in fours to the Judges lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street, after the Judges had entered their Carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in.
```

Public support in favour of the prisoners had been evident, and as the proceedings had continued into the evening, the crowd appears to have done what it could to put an end to them.

The late trial at Nottingham of the Luddites lasted till half-past two o'clock on the Sunday morning! As the evening advanced, the conduct of the audience, particularly in the outer hall, became very tumultuous: the lights were put out by the crowd, who called out "No lights here!!" Every thing in favor of the prisoners was applauded by clapping of hands; and when the prisoners were declared *Not Guilty*, the verdict was received with three cheers within the hall, and three times three without. Upwards of *two thousand* men were collected, the *major part* of whom had sticks, and some are supposed to have had *pistols* concealed. What the effect would have been had a verdict of *Guilty* been pronounced against the prisoners, it is shocking think!—It is confidently said that no more assizes will held at Nottingham, but that Newark will in future be the assize town for the county.

At *Nottingham*, James Croft and James Brayfield, charged with setting fire to the house of the said James Croft, were acquitted. The Town-hall was crowded to excess; and the public mind was very much agitated in consequence of the verdict of their acquittal.— At the County Hall, Glover and Chettle were also acquitted of the charge of breaking Mr Wright's frames. The trial occupied from Saturday afternoon till half-past two on Sunday morning; and as the evening advanced, the conduct of the audience, particularly in the outer hall, became very tumultuous. The lights were put out by the crowd, who called out, "no lights here." Every thing in favor of the prisoners was applauded by clapping of hands; and when they were declared not guilty, the verdict was received with three cheers within the hall, and three times three without. Upwards of 2000 men were collected, the major part of whom had sticks, and some are supposed to have had pistols concealed.— Many of the members of the Court were insulted: and the Learned Judge (Graham) who tired the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going and returning from the Court: yet a more humane and amiable man, or one of more urbane manners, and in whom the desire to acquit himself as becomes his difficult and hight station, more clearly appears, does not exist.
```

For some, however, the behaviour of the crowd towards the Judge and other members of the Court was met with indignation.

We regret to observe that the pernicious spirit of Luddism still exists in Leicester, Nottingham, Lincoln, and other manufacturing counties. At the late Nottingham Assizes several desperate characters of this gang were tried, but acquitted. During the trials, says the Lincoln Paper of the 16th instant, Mr. Justice Graham, who tried the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going to, and returning from Court, and many members of the Court were also grossly insulted. There is no member of the Bench more distinguished for mildness, urbanity, and genuine humanity, than Mr. Justice Graham; and it must fill every person with indignation who hears of this infamous conduct.

## Chettle and Glover Remembered

Messrs. Chettle and Glover are, perhaps notable amongst the Luddites in that they both had brief obituaries published when they died two decades later, in 1838 and 1839, respectively, with particular reference to their court appearance.

On Chettle's death, the following appeared widely syndicated across the English local and London press: the part of the story that seems to have been most strongly remembered related not to the attack, or Topham, but to the manner in which the court proceedings seem to have been held; of the threat of popular, or perhaps that should be, protection racket, violence, felt inside the court room when it came time for the jury to give their verdict.

A Reminiscence.— *John Chettle*, one of the persons tried for frame-breaking in the year 1816, died a few days ago, at Radford, Nottinghamshire in the 64th year of his age. It is a well-known fact that during the trial of Chettle numbers of men who actually broke the frames assembled in the hall, armed, with the determination to destroy both judge and jury in case of the verdict going against the prisoner; he was, however, acquitted; and after his Majesty's pardon had been granted, the real offenders solemnly declared that Chettle never had any concern whatever in the outrages for which he had been tried.

When Thomas Glover's death was announced a year later, originally in the *Nottingham Review* of [Friday 25 January 1839](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18390125/030/0004), the *Leicester Chronicle* republished it with a far more evocative title:

Death of an alleged Luddite.

On Friday, Mr. Thos. Glover, lacemaker, died at Nottingham, aged 54. His death was very sudden; he fell down in a fit, when at work, and an inquest was held upon his body. The deceased was well known, in consequence of being tried, along with John Chettle, before Baron Graham, in the county hall at Nottingham, on Saturday the 3rd of August, 1816, charged with breaking the lace machines of Mr. Mullen and Mr. Wright, at New Radford. That memorable trial commenced on Saturday afternoon, and did not terminate until after two o'clock on Sunday morning. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Reader were counsel for the prosecution; the present Lord Chief Justice, then Mr. Denman, was the sole counsel for the prisoners, and added to his well-earned reputation by the ability with which he conducted and established the *alibi* set up, unquestionably the most complete of any it was ever our lot to witness in a court of justice. Fortunately for the public peace, the result of the trial was the acquittal of both prisoners. Had it been otherwise, the most fearful consequences would doubtless have ensued, for the body of the hall was for hours in possession of a number of men, who would not suffer a light to appear in court, excepting on the bench and the counsel table. It is notorious that armed men were in the outer hall, and the constables and javelin-men were quite unable to maintain order. Never shall we forget the shout with which the verdict of Not Guilty was received, and the unavailing attempts of the Judge to silence it. Since that period, Glover has sustained many vicissitudes of fortune, but latterly he has been much reduced in consequence of the great depreciation in the value of lace machinery. John Chettle, his fellow prisoner, died on the 15th of July last.— *Nottingham Review*.

The story, it seems, is what gets remembered, after the facts have been forgotten.

And as for Benjamin Topham? He had died a few years earlier, in 1832. And in some reports at least, he was *mis*-remembered as a man whose will had been broken, along with his frames, in the "Brandreth revolution" of Pentridge, in 1817.

On Thursday week, at Pentridge, of which place he was a native, Mr. Benjamin Topham, aged 67. He some years ago resided in Nottingham, where he was well known. His polities were liberal; yet at the Derbyshire, or Jerry Brandreth *revolution*, in June 1817 `sic`, all Topham's frames were broken. The disturbances broke out at Pentridge, where Topham was then living. He was an upright, industrious man, but he laid the breaking of his frames so much to heart, that he lost his energy of spirit, and almost sank under it.
