Nottingham Journal - Saturday 25 April 1812

We have forborne, as mochas possible, to notice the reports of riotous proceedings in various parts of the country, wishing rather to expose ourselves to the charge of tardiness, than with uncertified promptness to give currency to reports calculated to give pain to every thinking mind, and to extend the calamity by holding out example.—This forbearance we by no means regret, as in many instances reports of disturbances have been circulated, which really had no existence but in the wicket minds of their propagators, and others have been grossly exaggerated, with what view it is not difficult to determine. We think it our duty, however, to lay before our readers the following extracts, quoting their authorities:—

MANCHESTER, April 21.—The potato market, in Shude Hill, was on Saturday morning the scene of great disorder and confusion, owing to the much increased price in that indispensible part of the sustenance of the poor. Between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, a number of ignorant unthinking people, most of whom were women, failing in their endeavour to purchase the potatoes at the reduced rate which they required them, immediately put themselves in possession of most of the produce in the market, and never did we behold industry more conspicuous than in the seizure and conveyance of this spoil to the various abodes of the busy depredators. Their labours, however, were soon arrested by the interference of the military, when several were taken into custody (chiefly women), and no more violence ensued.

Yesterday afternoon, betwixt the hours of two and three, a cart laden with meal, going to Oldham, was stopped at Miles Platting and overturned, and the contents seized by the multitude. In consequence of which, a number of women have since been apprehended, and conducted to our New Bailey prison. Some disturbances have taken place at the upper end of Deansgate, but by the exertions of the military and civil power at present all appears quiet.

*Monday Evening, 7 o'clock.*—Accounts have just reached us of alarming disturbances at Middleton. Mr. Burton's factory is said to be an object of the fury of the riotous multitude, five of whom, it is added, have fallen by the hands of the defenders of the premises. When the last accounts came away, every thing however was quiet. *Manchester Mercury*

Stockport, April 16.— On Tuesday morning last, about eight o'clock, a mob began to collect at the outskirts of this town.—The first act of outrage was on the mansion of Peter Marsland, Esq. in Eaton-lane; the windows of which they completely demolished. They then attacked a house in the Underbank, and proceeding up the Hill-gate, destroyed the windows in Mr. Hindley's house; after which Mr. Radcliffe's factory shared the same fate—some ruffians had, on the preceding Saturday evening, fired into the latter gentleman's house. At the same time, and in concert, another party destroyed the machinery, and gutted the factory of Mr. J. Goodair, of Edgeley, and entering his house, seized the furniture, and set it on fire in the middle of one of the rooms, but the cavalry coming up at this moment, saved the house from being consumed.—An attempt made on Mr. Sykes's property was also frustrated by the approach of troops.

"The Magistrates ordered all public-houses to be shut up, and this preserved peace in the evening.—On Wednesday the mob again assembled Cheadle Heath, but after some deliberation, dispersed in various directions.

"Nine of rioters are committed to prison. I do not hear of any lives being lost; but several were severely cut and much injured by the mob." *Ibid.*

RIOTS

Carlisle, April 18.

We are sorry to state, that the perturbation of the popular mind, excited by the buying up of provisions, has not subsided. During the whole week, carts have been conveying grain, and other articles of provisions, to be shipped; but such was the dread of popular feeling, that they were compelled to make a circuit by Rockcliff, and to cross the river. On Monday evening, the premises of Denton-mill, near this city, were assailed, in consequence of a suspicion that the miller had been buying grain for exportation. Several windows were broken. In the mean time, the indignation of the mob, which had been prevented from openly exhibiting itself, has been indicated by more wary operations, the effects of which were apparent on Thursday night. On that night, persons assembled from several parts of Carlisle, to the appointed place of rendezvous, armed with various offensive weapons. They proceeded thence to a place where a vessel was lying some distance below Port Carlisle, laden with, bacon, cheese, and flour—we understand on the account of Messrs Porters, of this city. The vessel was instantly boarded, and, in a very short space of time, the mob cleared the cargo, and, "dividing the spoil," carried off the whole.

Sheffield, April 18.

About twelve o'clock on Tuesday last, (being market day) a number of mischievous persons assembled in the Market Place, where they seized the potatoes, fish, and some other commodities exposed for sale, and threw them about the streets in a most tumultuous manner; and though these infatuated people were early admonished by the magistrates to disperse, they afterwards broke open several cellars in which potatoes were deposited, and threw the contents at each other, in doing which many windows were broken.

In consequence of these violent outrages, the magistrates read, in different parts of the town, the Riot Act; and, we are sorry to say, they were greatly annoyed by the populace in fulfilling this essential function of office.

It was now insinuated by some evil disposed persons, that the fire-arms belonging to the Sheffield Local Militia should be destroyed. No sooner was the hint given, than hundreds of the mob proceeded to the place in the Wicker, where the said arms were deposited, and, after having met with considerable resistance in their attempts to gain admittance, the serjeants on duty were at last overpowered by vollies of stones, which broke the windows, and at which some of the rioters gained an entrance into the building. About one hundred stand of arms and the drums were quickly broken, and other damage committed. Whilst the mob were engaged in this daring work of destruction, a party of the 15th Light Dragoons arrived from the barracks, apprehended several of them, and dispersed the remainder.

No lives were lost during this short but shameful disturbance; and it was a most fortunate circumstance that Hugh Parker, Esq. S. Wortley, Esq. and the Rev. S. Corbett, the magistrates of the district, were on this occasion engaged in their usual official duties at the Tow~n flail, by whom the most prompt measures were adopted, and, before three o'clock in the afternoon, the final peace of the town was secured" and confirmed.

The Sheffield, Rotherham, and Kiveton troops of West Riding Yeomanry Cavalry, and the Shefflield Regiment of Local Militia were soon under arms.

THe acting and auxiliary constables were also  in attendance; and it gives us pleasure to state, that the Magistrates, the 15th Dragoons, the Yeomanry Cavalry, and the Local Militia, have all done their duty.

About seven o'clock in the evening of the disturbance, four of the rioters were sent off to York Castle, to take their trial at the next Assizes. They were conveyed from the Town Hall in two chaises, and escorted by a guard of the 15th Light Horse a considerable distance.

About dusk the cavalry dismissed the people who were assembled in the streets, and remained on during the night.

Stockport, April 14.

As in other places, most alarming disturbances have broken out here—chiefly on account of the excessive dearness of provisions, and the almost total dulness of trade, which has thrown several hundreds out of employ. Among other acts of violence, a large weaving factory in the Highgate, commonly called Radcliffe's factory, and Goodly's factory, (still larger) in Edgley, had the windows broken, the cloth cut out of the looms and destroyed, the household furniture of the adjacent dwelling-house broken in pieces, and the house itself set on fire, as were several others. Marsland's factory, (one of the largest in England) with several others, were either burnt down, or entirely destroyed.

Macclesfield is still in a worse state. The rioters have pulled down the gaol, and set the prisoners free.

"Buckley Arms, Stockport, April 14.  
"We had been for some days under great apprehension of the mob. This morning about nine o'clock, the people began to assemble in considerable numbers. They halted at our large gates, (at Edgeley), and remained there for nearly an hour, calling to us at intervals to open our windows, and throwing stones in order to compel us to comply with their wishes. Finding neither of any avail, they proceeded towards this town, their numbers increasing as they proceeded along. Instead of entering by the usual road, they visited several houses and factories, where they broke all before them. They then returned to Edgley, in number about three thousand. On perceiving them from our cottage coming down the road, I assembled the children and nurse in the parlour, and fastened the windows and doors; the gardener presently rushed into the room, and conjured us to fly that moment, if we wished to save our lives. It was with difficulty I could speak; but each snatching up a child, we escaped at the great gate just in time to avoid the rabble. We proceeded to Mrs. Sykes's; but before we reached our destination, we saw our cottage enveloped in flames. Every thing, I have since learnt, was consumed by fire, and notihng left but the shell. The mob next proceeded to the factory, where they broke the windows, destroyed the looms, and cut all the work which was in progress; and having finished this mischief, they repeated the three cheers which they gave on seeing the flames first burst from our dwelling. The cry was, "Now for Sykes!" but, before they could accomplish their wicked purpose on our friend, same military arrived, accompanied by Mr Turner, whose exertions have been indefatigable. He had been much distressed on seeing our house in flames and had seen nobody to inform him of our escape. The post-chaise in which we came was escorted by four of the Scots Greys. The rioters were headed by two men, dressed in women's clothes, which were called *General Ludd's wives*. We are again left without apparel, but such as the kindness of our friends supplies. Mr Sykes has been trying to get more soldiers at Edgeley, for the rioters appear worse than ever. Marsland and other families have taken shelter at Manchester. Mr Garside, who endeavoured to protect our property, and even ventured to reproach the mob for their conduct, has been severely beaten and bruised.

"It is now nine o'clock at night, and I learn the mob are more outrageous than ever at Edgeley. Fresh soldiers have been just sent there. Another troop of horse are expected to-night."

Stamford Mercury - Friday 19 June 1812

MANCHESTER. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on Thursday night, Mr. Nadin, assisted a Picquet of Military, took into custody (and seized the papers of) *thirty-seven persons*, unlawfully assembled at a public-house in Ancoat's-lane, Manchester, and lodged them in the New Bayley prison. They were examined on Friday before the Magistrates, when it appeared, by their own confession, that they came from different townships, comprising a circuit of at least eight or ten miles.— The Magistrates remanded them for a further examination on Saturday, when they were all fully committed for trial for having administered an unlawful and infamous oath, called "twisting in."

A man was taken up at Preston, on Thursday last, charged with the murder of the Serjeant in the Local Militia and his female Cousin, in Manchester. The Police having obtained possession of a letter in which the man desired he might be addressed under a feigned name, to he left at the Post-office till called for, sent him a blank cover, directed as desired, and at the same time sent a person to secure him as soon as he made his appearance. The man thought he was taken for *twisting in*; but on being given to understand that it was for murder, he asked if his wife was taken? when he was told she was, or they should not have apprehended him.
