Nottingham Review - Friday 09 August 1816

Frame-breaking and Arson.

The Public are respectfully informal, that in consequence of the great Interest which the Trials of JOHN CHETTLE and THOMAS GLOVER for FRAME-BREAKING, and JAMES CROFFS and JAMES BRAYFIELD for ARSON, have excited in the Town; their Trials at Length, as given in this Paper, will be printed (at the Review Office) in a pamphlet, as being more suitable for after-reference than the Columns of the Newspaper. It is also intended to attach thereto, as large a Report of the Trials of TOWLE, BADDER, and SLATER, who will take their Trials at Leicester, for Framebreaking, as can be procured.

The Day of Publication, and the Price of the Pamphlet, which must necessarily by regulated by the Length of the latter Trials, will be announced in next week's Review.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 24 August 1816

We regret to observe that the pernicious spirit of Luddism still exists in Leicester, Nottingham, Lincoln, and other manufacturing counties. At the late Nottingham Assizes several desperate characters of this gang were tried, but acquitted. During the trials, says the Lincoln Paper of the 16th instant, Mr. Justice Graham, who tried the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going to, and returning from Court, and many members of the Court were also grossly insulted. There is no member of the Bench more distinguished for mildness, urbanity, and genuine humanity, than Mr. Justice Graham; and it must fill every person with indignation who hears of this infamous conduct.

Leicester Journal - Friday 16 August 1816

Also appears as: Stamford Mercury - Friday 23 August 1816

Saturday morning presented a most interesting and grateful spectacle; the violent and disgraceful proceedings which are stated to have occurred during the late Assizes at Nottingham, and which were said to have intimidated the Jury, from a conscientious discharge of their duty, induced a large portion of the most respectable inhabitants of this town, to rally round the Constituted Authorities, and give their aid towards the administration of Justice. At 6 o'clock between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange, each receiving a white wand and a club, and headed by the Chief Magistrate, proceeded in fours to the Judges lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street, after the Judges had entered their Carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in.

Stamford Mercury - Friday 23 August 1816

[widely syndicated]

The late trial at Nottingham of the Luddites lasted till half-past two o'clock on the Sunday morning! As the evening advanced, the conduct of the audience, particularly in the outer hall, became very tumultuous: the lights were put out by the crowd, who called out "No lights here!!" Every thing in favor of the prisoners was applauded by clapping of hands; and when the prisoners were declared *Not Guilty*, the verdict was received with three cheers within the hall, and three times three without. Upwards of *two thousand* men were collected, the *major part* of whom had sticks, and some are supposed to have had *pistols* concealed. What the effect would have been had a verdict of *Guilty* been pronounced against the prisoners, it is shocking think!—It is confidently said that no more assizes will held at Nottingham, but that Newark will in future be the assize town for the county.

Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette - Thursday 22 August 1816

At *Nottingham*, James Croft and James Brayfield, charged with setting fire to the house of the said James Croft, were acquitted. The Town-hall was crowded to excess; and the public mind was very much agitated in consequence of the verdict of their acquittal.— At the County Hall, Glover and Chettle were also acquiited of the charge of breaking Mr Wright's frames. The trial occupied from Saturday afternoon till half-past two on Sunday morning; and as the evening advanced, the conduct of the audience, particularly in the outer hall, became very tumultuous. The lights were put out by the crowd, who called out, "no lights here." Every thing in favor of the prisoners was applauded by clapping of hands; and when they were declared not guilty, the verdict was received with three cheers within the hall, and three times three without. Upwards of 2000 men were collected, the major part of whom had sticks, and some are supposed to have had pistols concealed.— Many of the members of the Court were insulted: and the Learned Judge (Graham) who tired the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going and returning from the Court: yet a more humane and amiable man, or one of more urbane manners, and in whom the desire to acquit himself as becomes his difficult and hight station, more clearly appears, does not exist.
