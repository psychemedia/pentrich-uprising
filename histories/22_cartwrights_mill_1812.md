THE WOOLLEN TRADE.

For the DAILY ADVERTISER AND ORACLE.

Respecting the discordant matter's in the Woollen Manufactories, it is a pity Gentlemen in Parliament, who are to decide on the merits of a Bill to regulate trade, should not receive better information, or understand enough of the principle's to prevent so many misconstructions on Acts of Parliament, which, instead of rendering them clear and decisive, are too often found ambiguous and unintelligible, and this occasions much contention.

A few years since the Sheermen brought actions against the Clothiers for using the gig-mill to abridge their labour; and herein they failed, because in the Act of Parliament on which they proceeded it was described as a "burling machine," and Sheermen are not Burlers. This was tried at Salisbury.

It is now represented to Parliament that the Sheermen oppose "a certain chemical process;" this is wrong. It 'should have been said mechanical; for, it is machinery only which they oppose.

Manual labour is much taken off, and laws established by idle labourers, in clubs and secret committees, supported by compelling every individual to contribute a regular and equal portion, or be expelled from his trade. That the employer suffers much injury in his property, is cheated of labour for which he pays, and the credit of the cloths are affected to a serious degree in those countries where nocturnal depredations have prevented the use of gig-mills. This must introduce the sheering machines, which would render the manufacturers, in some degree, independent of these combinations, and greatly reduce manual labour. But the gig-mill has a contrary effect; for though it is a substitute for labour in raising wool on the face of the cloth, it produces so much more than Sheermen, by labour, will raise, that they are fully repaid in the extra business of cutting it off; and the cloth has a much more soft and delicate appearance.

A FRIEND TO TRADE, AN ENEMY TO COMBINATIONS, BUT NO MANUFACTURER, AND A CANDID OBSERVER.

N. B. Gig-mills in some parts of England have been in constant use for time immemorial, though so violently opposed in others.

Through every combination amongst workmen, none is so desperate, secret, or systematic as that of the Sheermen.

We trust that the disturbances in Nottingham and to Vicinity are at an end: the Nottingham Paper of Saturday, which we received this morning, does not make any mention of disturbances during the last week. But a disposition to riot, we regret to state, has manifested itself near Huddersfield, in Yorkshire. Last Saturday week a number of persons assembled near the premises of Mr. Joseph Hirst, of Marsh, with their faces blacked, and their persons in other respects disguised, and having forcibly obtained admittance into the dressing-shops, proceeded to destroy all the machinery used in the dressing of cloth, such as dressing frames, shears, and other implements used in what is commonly called Gig Mills, the whole of which they completely demolished. The same, or a similar party then proceeded to the workshops of Mr. James Balderson, of Crossland Moor, where machinery of a similar description is employed, upon which they committed similar depredations, completely destroying or rendering useless the whole of the machinery. The depredations appeared to Magistrates to be of that alarming nature, to induce them to apply to Gen. Vyse, of Beverley, for military aid, who dispatched an express to Leeds, with an order for the troop of Scotch Greys stationed there, to proceed immediately to Huddersfield, and which marched at eleven o’clock Monday night, for that place. It not being thought expedient to leave Leeds without military, a squadron of cavalry was marched from Sheffield, and arrived about nine o’clock on Tuesday morning, and in the afternoon of the same day a squadron of the 2d Dragoon Guards stationed at the Barracks near York, were dispatched to Huddersfield, to relieve the Scotch Greys who returned to Leeds on Thursday.

We have not heard that any disposition to disturbance has manifested itself in any other part of Yorkshire.

Nottingham Review - Friday 06 March 1812

We understand that the disturbances have ceased, at least for the present, at Huddersfield. Small parties of the military guard all the gig mills near Leeds every night as a precautionary measure.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 March 1812

No further depredations were committed in the neighbourhood of Leeds last week; but so much alarm prevails amongst the proprietors of gig-mills, that a military guard is stationed for their protection. The Scots Greys, which have been in Leeds some time, have received an order to march to Manchester, in which neighbourhood there is collected a large military force, not less than 6000 men.

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18120327/040/0004
Nottingham Review - Friday 27 March 1812

We have received a letter from our Correspondent at Leeds, this morning. He says, "Contrary to my expectations, I have to inform you of further depredations committed by the populace. On Tuesday night, the warehouse of Messrs. Dickenson and Shann, in the Meadow_lane, of this town, was entered by the roof, and cloth to the value of £500 was cut and damaged. Messrs. Thompson and Co. thought it necessary to guard their gig-mill at Rawden, but on Monday evening, the watchmen were all surprised and secured, and the obnoxious part of the machinery was destroyed. Various reports are in circulation of damage done in other places, one report states that cloth to the amount of £4000 has been destroyed at Elland, near Halifax; most probably this is an exaggeration, but I believe there is some truth in it."

In the Huddersfield area, the attacks on machinery started at the end of February, 1812.

We learn with extreme concern, that in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, within a short distance of that town, no fewer than twenty frames or machines have been broken, employed exclusively in the operation of cropping cloth. Serious apprehensions are entertained that further mischief will be committed, and the principal manufacturers who have availed themselves of this species of mechanism, are provided with arms and watchmen, to prevent such depredation.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 29 February 1812

MACHINERY DESTROYED

It is with deep regret we have to state that outrages of a most alarming description and extent, have been recently committed in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. On the night of Saturday last, a number of persons assembled near the premises of Mr. Joseph Hirst, of Marsh, with their faces blacked, and their persons in other respects disguised, and having forcibly obtained admittance in to the dressing shops, proceeded to destroy all the machinery used in the dressing of cloth such as dressing frames, shears, and other implements used in what is commonly call Gig Mills, the whole of which they completely demolished. The same, or a similar party then proceeded to the workshops of Mr. James Balderson, of Crossland Moor, in which machinery of the same description was employed, in which they committed similar depredations, completely destroying or rendering useless the whole of the machinery. The manner in which these outrages were perpetrated, was this—The depredators, or to use the cant terms, Luddites, assemble with as much privacy as possible, at the place marked out for attack, and divide themselves into two parties, the more daring and expert of which enter the premises, provided with proper implements for the work of destruction, which they accomplish a with astonishing secrecy and dispatch. The other party remain conveniently stationed at the outside of the building, to keep off all intruders, or to give the alarm, if a superior force, was likely to be opposed to them. As soon as the work of destruction was completed, the Leader drew up his men, called over the roll, each man answering to a particular number instead of his name; they then fired off their pistols, (for they were armed,) gave a shout, and marched off in regular military order. They do not appear to have done any mischief besides breaking the machinery; and one of the party having asked the Leader what they should do with one of the Proprietors, he replied, not hurt a hair of his head; but that should they be under the necessity of visiting him again, they could not shew him any mercy.

The depredations appeared to the Magistrates to be of so alarming a nature, as to induce them to apply to General Vyse, of Beverley, for military aid, who dispatched an express to this town, with an order for the Troop of Scotch Greys stationed in this town, to proceed immediately to Huddersfield, and which marched at 11 o'clock on Monday night, for that place. And it not being thought expedient to leave this town without military, a squadron of Cavalry was marched from Sheffield, and arrived about nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, and in the afternoon of the same day, a squadron of the 2nd Dragoon Guards, arrived from York, and on Wednesday proceeded to Huddersfield, to relieve the Scotch Grey's who returned to this town on Thursday. The Cavalry from Sheffield left this place on Thursday morning. These military movements have naturally created much anxious curiosity, but no disposition has been evinced in this neighbourhood, to disturb the public peace.

On Wednesday night, notwithstanding the presence of the Military, a party broke into a Mill situated between Slaithwaite and Huddersfield, and carried on their work of destruction there in a similar manner.

```

A leader column in the *Leeds Mercury* repeated the call it had made previously in the context of the attacks in Nottingham and Derbyshire, recommending instead that those responsible eschew violence and machine breaking, and instead lobby against see the Order in Council as a major cause of their concerns.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 29 February 1812

The Mercury

We have more than once adverted to the unhappy disturbances at Nottingham, and as far as our influence and efforts could extend, endeavoured to convince the deluded people concerned in these outrages, that they had grossly mistaken the cause of their distress which originated, not in the use of machinery, but in the decay of trade, the unhappy effect of war, and the Orders in Council; we advised them to petition not for Peace, for we considered that as hopeless, but for the removal of the Orders in Council. For this conduct we were denounced as traitors, and branded as incendiaries; but it is a conduct we do not repent of: We offer the same advice to those mistaken persons who are now disturbing the peace of this county by similar outrages. The destruction of all the machinery in the kingdom would not contribute an iota towards relieving their distress. The proceedings they have adopted are most reprehensible and destructive, they tend to destroy the very bonds of society, they introduce into the very heart of the country a species of Civil War, they put those in a state of hostility with each other, who ought to be the best friends, and ultimately tend to introduce either general anarchy or complete military despotism. We would conjure them as they value their country, their wives, their children, their own lives, to pause in this destructive career, and to abandon, before it is too late, a system which can terminate only in misery and ruin.

```

In Huddersfield the magistrates and mill-owners formed a committee against the outrages, and offered a reward for the arrest of those who were responsible.

Huddersfield.

AT A GENERAL MEETING OF THE MAGISTRATES,  
Merchants, Manufacturers, And Inhabitants  
Of Huddersfield, and its Vicinity,

Convened by Notice, to be holden at the House of Mr. John Townsend, the George Inn, in Huddersfield, aforesaid,

On Thursday, the 27th. Day of February, 1812,

The following Resolutions were agreed to:

IT appears to the Meeting, that violent and determined Spirit of Insubordination has gained much ground amongst the Workmen employed in various Trades and Manufactures, and particularly amongst the Shearmen; and that the same is organized and supported in a Manner, not only alarming to Trade in general, but to the Peaceable Inhabitants of this Town and Neighbourhood in particular.

THAT We cannot sufficiently deprecate all Attempts to limit the Ingenuity of our Artificers, the employment of our Capital, and to proscribe the mode in which which the different operations of our Trade shall be conducted, and particularly those now making in this Neighbourhood, for the Destruction of the Machinery used in the finishing of Woollen Cloth.

THAT the Destruction already Committed upon this kind of Machinery in this Neighbourhood, and the Threats of future Depredations, evidently proceed from an illegal Combination of Desperate Men. And We conceive it the duty of all Men to suppress, as much as lies in their power, such Vicious and Unlawful Combinations, and to assist and use their utmost endeavours, to detect and bring to Justice, not only the Perpetrators, but such as Countenance and Support them.

THAT a Subscription be immediately entered into, for the purpose of procuring Information of the Proceedings of any illegal Combination, and of liberally Rewarding any Person, giving such Information as may lead to the Detection and Conviction of any such Offenders.

THAT the Management of this Subscription be under the Direction of a Committee, any Five of whom shall have power to act, as Occasion may require.

In Pursuance of the above Resolutions,

A Subscription has been entered into; and the Committee hereby offer a Reward of

One Hundred Guineas

To any Person or Persons who will give such Information, so as to lead to the Conviction of any of the Parties recently concerned in Destroying the Dressing Frames of Mr. Joseph Hirst, of Marsh; Mr. James Balderston, of Crosland Moor; and Mr. William Hinchliffe, of Ley Moor, all near Huddersfield; and also the same Reward will be given to any Person or Persons who will give *Private Information* of the intention of the Depredators to commit any further Mischief, so as such Information shall lead to the Apprehension and Conviction of any of the Offenders, and *Inviolable Secrecy will be observed*.

## Attack on Foster's Mill

At the start of April, the operations mounted by the machine breakers became increasingly ambitious. Following several smaller actions, on the night of Thursday, April 9th, 1812, there was a concerted attack on Foster's Mill at Horbury Bridge, a 10 mile walk or so from Huddersfield. In all, a reported 300 men or so, men who had marched in not just from Huddersfield, but also from the surrounding valleys, assembled with a single aim in mind.

Stamford Mercury - Friday 17 April 1812

RIOTS IN YORKSHIRE.— We are sorry to have to notice some fresh outrages in the West riding of the county. In the early part of last week, the work of destruction re-commenced in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. The first sufferer was Mr. Smith, of Snowgate-Head, near Holmfirth: the rioters broke all his shears and dressing-frames. Horn Coat, about mile distant, was the next place of action: there they destroyed the frames and shears of Mr. Joseph Brook, broke his windows and demolished his furniture. Mr. James Brook, of Reins, near Honley, three miles from the last place, had also one frame broken, the only one he had, and which had been taken down several weeks.—But the most desperate riot was on Thursday night last, when upwards 300 depredators, armed with fire-arms, hatchets, and clubs, entered the cloth manufactory of Mr. J. Foster, of Horbury, near Wakefield; destroyed and injured every thing they could lay their hands on, whether belonging to the manufactory or not; ill-used the persons found on the premises; and lastly set fire to the building, but which was fortunately afterwards extinguished.—The damage is estimated 700*l.*

Riots and other Outrages.

*Leeds, April 11.*—On Thursday night, about twelve o'clock, the extensive cloth manufactory of Mr. Joseph Foster, of Horbury, near Wakefield, was surrounded by a large body of armed men, who, after securing all the approaches to the proceeded to break into that part of the mill appropriated to the dressing of cloth, where they completely destroyed all the shears and frames; the former were not merely snipped, but absolutely broke pieces. They then demolished all the windows, and, as if actuated the most diabolical frenzy, broke into those parts of premises, against which these depredators do not pretend to have any ground complaint, the scribbling mill and weaving shops, and materially injured the machinery and wantonly damaged a quantity of warp ready for the loom, destroyed not merely the glass of the windows, but the frames which were of cast iron, the windows of the dyehouses, the counting-house, and even the dwelling-houses contiguous to the workshop shared the same fate. At the commencement of these dreadful outrages, a detachment from the main body invested the dwelling-house occupied by Mr. Foster's sons; they literally shivered the door in pieces, and broke both the windows & frames, and proceeded to the lodging-room of the young men, and demanded the keys of the building under pain of instant death. They dragged two of them out of bed, and tied them together, leaving them naked upon the floor; the other they compelled to accompany them with the keys, but this last outrage was quite unnecessary, as many practicable breaches had been already made in the building, and a considerable progress made in the work of destruction. The dwelling-house occupied by the book keeper was also broken into, and his family treated with the most brutal violence, and to complete the full measure of their guilt, they afterwards set fire to the building, but which was happily extinguished, After their departure before it communicated to the main body of the building, but not before very considerable damage had been done. The lawless men having accomplished their object, assembled in a neighbouring field, when the leader called over their numbers, to which each individual answered. Having ascertained that their whole number was there, said, "the work is done, all is well, disperse:" which order was obeyed.

*Leeds, April 13.*— The following account of the affair at Mr. Cartwright's mill, at Rowfold, between Cleckheaton and Littletown, may be depended upon as correct. About 20 or 30 minutes after twelve o'clock, on Saturday night, the Gig-Mill was attacked by the Luddites or Snappers, and the windows and door of the mill were assailed by a furious mob, who commenced their attack by the firing of arms and the beating of hammers and hatchets. The guard in the mill instantly repelled the assault by steady, firm and well-directed discharge of musquetry from within. A regular engagement succeeded, which continued from 15 to 20 minutes, during which time, not fewer than 140 shot were discharged from within. The assailants were foiled their attempt to force the windows or doors, and did no other damage than break the glass windows of the mill. The deluded mob did not escape unhurt. Two of the unhappy men were left wounded upon the spot, and there is great reason to believe that several more received the contents of the defenders' muskets, as traces of blood have been observed. The two wounded men were put under the care of surgeons as soon as could be done; one of them, John Booth, a tinner's apprentice, at Huddersfield, died after having had his leg amputated. Samuel Hartley, a cropper, Huddersfield, who worked with one Web or Webster, at the same place, (and formerly with Mr. Cartwright, at Halifax) was shot trough the breast; he died yesterday afternoon. From the direction of the shot, it is conjectured that he received his wound in the act of firing into the mill, or in an attitude similar to that of firing a musket. Several hammers, masks and picklock key were left upon the premises. Both of the men died without making any confession of their accomplices; but several must have been so wounded as to lead to the knowledge of them.

## Attack on Cartwright's Mill

Emboldened by the attack on Foster's Mill on April 9th, 1812, another ambitious affair was planned that would bring together men from Huddersfield and the Spen Valley in an attack on Cartwright's Mill at Rawfolds.

A round up of news in the *Hampshire Chronicle* summarised not just the attack on Foster's Mill, but also reported the attack on Cartwright's Mill.

RIOTS IN THE COUNTRY.

On Thursday night, about 12 o'clock, a large body of armed men broke into the cloth manufactory of Mr. Foster, near Wakefield, and destroyed all the shears and frames, materially injured the machinery of the scribbling mill and weaving shop, damaged a quantity of warp ready for the loom, and committed other acts violence. They likewise broke into the dwelling-house occupied by the sons of Mr. F, dragged two of them out of bed, and tied them together, making them lie naked upon the floor, the other they compelled to accompany them with the keys. The dwelling-house occupied by the book-keeper was also broken into, and his family treated with the most brutal violence; and they afterwards set fire to the building, but which was happily extinguished, after their departure, before it communicated to the main body of the building, but not before very considerable damage had been done.

Sunday sennight, about twelve o'clock, a number of armed men, with their faces covered, entered the workshop of Mr. Smith, of Snowgate-head, Huddersfield, and broke all his dressing frames and shears. They next proceeded to Horn Coat, entered the dressing-shop of Mr. Joseph Brook, and not content with breaking his frames and shears, demolished his household furniture and all the windows. At Reims `(sic; Reins)`, near Honley, about three miles further, they arrived about two o'clock, and entered the workshop Mr. James Brook, and broke one frame, which was all he had, and which had been taken down 5 weeks.

...

Littletown, *(near Leeds), April 13.* — "I thought, after the recent trials and punishments, we should hear no more of the *Luddites*, at least for some time; but we had warm work in this neighbourhood on Saturday night last. The *Croppers* alias *Luddites* assembled to the number of from 150 to 200 men, with an intent to destroy Cartwright's cropping machines at Rawfold, not far from this town, and proceeded to break open the doors, but without effect, as they, as well as the windows, were extremely well secured with iron bars, and breast-works of flag-stones, and every precaution taken to frustrate their attempts. Cartwright is a resolute man, and having reason believe that his property would be attacked some night when he least expected it, took the resolution of sleeping the mill every night, with a little garrison consisting of six men. At the time the attack was made, two of the chosen band, (one of whom was soldier) refused to fight. Firing was kept up on both sides for a considerable time, and as it will appear not without effect. The rioters finding they could not get the door down with their hatchets and hammers, nearly shot it down. It was expected they would soon enter, but the invaders drew off and disappeared. Some are supposed to be thrown into the dam, and two wounded were lying near the building, one with leg broken (by a shot), which was soon after amputated, and he survived but a very little time. It is said he is a clergyman's son, about 19, apprentice to a tinner, at Huddersfield. The other was from Halifax, and had a bullet which took off part of the flesh of his arm, entered his chest, and went through. Mr. ———— saw him about 12 o'clock, when he seemed dying, and it is said he is since dead, but made no confession. They are known to each other by numbers, not by name. Other mills in the neighbourhood are guarded in a similar manner; and the proprietors, encouraged by this example, are determined to make the most vigorous resistance."

EXTRACT OF ANOTHER LETTER.

*Littletown, April 13.*—We had some warm work in this neighbourhood on Saturday night last. The Croppers alias Luddites assembled to the number of about 150 or 200 men, with an intent to destroy Cartwright's Cropping machines at Rawfold, not far from this town, and proceeded to break open the doors, but without effect, as they as well as the windows were extremely well secured with iron bars, and every precaution taken to frustrate their attempts. Cartwright is a resolute man, and having reason to believe his property would be attacked some night when he least expected it, took the resolution of sleeping in the mill every night, with a little garrison consisting of 6 men. At the time the attack was made, two of his chosen band (one of whom was a *soldier*) refused to fight. The contest began with an unequal force of five men against 150—but *"Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just."*— Firing was kept up on both sides for a considerable time, and it will appear, not without effect: Cartwright and his party fired 140 times from his windows; some of the Luddites were killed, and several wounded, I have seen two of these poor deluded men dead, who have fallen a sacrifice to their temerity; another is reported to have since died of his wounds, and how many more are languishing remains to be ascertained. Cartwright and his men were so well protected behind the walls, that they escaped unhurt, but they frequently exposed themselves and fought like heros, particularly the GOVERNOR.— Cartwright and his guard kept watch every night in the event of a renewal of the attack.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 18 April 1812

We lament to state new disorders in the neighbourhood of Leeds. The following are the particulars, given in a letter:

"Heckmondwike, April 12.—On rising this morning found the rioters had attacked Mr. Cartwright's mill at the Rawfolds, just beyond Little Town, who is, it seemed, a very spirited man, and was well prepared for them, having himself, with eight soldiers, slept in the mill for some time, and had well barricaded it. It was secured on the back by the dam; breast-works of large flag-stones were put before the windows, leaving apertures for those inside to put their firelocks through. A sentinel was placed on the outside, whom the rioters surprised and disarmed. In the mill all were asleep, bus one, when the attack commenced. Mr. C. with true courage, said, "Now, my lads, they are come, be steady." His party being placed behind the flag-stones, he went to the middle window and fired (as he saw occasion) from side to side. The soldiers say, they never saw a man fire and load so fast. The rioters finding they could not get the door down with their hatchets and hammers, nearly shot it down. It was expected they would soon enter, when Mr. C. ordered the soldiers to fix bayonets, declaring he would shoot the first that flinched; but the invaders soon drew off, and disappeared. Some are supposed to be thrown into the dam, and two, wounded, were lying near the building, one with a leg broken (by a shot), which was soon after amputated, and he survived but a very little time. It is said, he is a clergyman's son, about 19, apprentice to a tinner, at Huddersfield. The other was from Halifax, and had a bullet, which took off part of the flesh of his arm, entered his chest, and went through. Mr. ——— saw him about 12 o'clock, when he seemed dying, and it is said he is since dead; but made no confession. We hope this will deter from further proceedings. They are known to each other by numbers, not by name. Other mills in the neighbourhood are guarded in a similar manner, and the proprietors, encouraged by this example, are determined to make the most vigorous resistance."

Another letter from a gentleman at Halifax, to his friend in this neighbourhood, dated April 14, says, "The *Luddites*, for so we have begun to call them, have met with a rebuff in this neighbourhood: Mr. Cartwright, late of this town, now of Cleckheaton, has had his mill in a state of defence for some time past; on Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, it was attacked; Mr. Cartwright and his friends were prepared, and a smart engagement took place for about eighteen minutes, in which time Mr. C.'s men fired 140 cartridges. The cavalry then came up, and the assailants were dispersed. Two of them were left severely wounded, one in the thigh, the other in the breast. The former submitted to amputation, but died in an hour after the operation; the other died also in the course of the day: both sullenly refused to give any information.—Blood has been traced two or three miles from the place, in various directions, since the flight of the insurgents, and a finger has been picked up. It is hoped that so firm and successful a resistance will stop the progress of these deluded men in their lawless aggressions.—Mr. Cartwright is a spirited man, and has been in the army."

A spirit of riot and disorder has been manifested at Sheffield, in consequence of the high price of provisions and want of employment. On Tuesday last a large mob of men, women, and children, assembled in the principal streets, and as if conformity to some previously concerted plan, the whole body rushed with violent exclamations to the Town Magazine, which they forced open, and carried off, or destroyed, in a few seconds, the whole of the arms and ammunition, &c. on which they could lay their hands, belonging to the Local Militia. The Magistrates, however, exerted themselves so successfully in quelling the tumult, that no further mischief has been done. A strong military force is kept on duty.

Some acts of violence, from the same causes, lave also this week been offered by the weavers - at Stockport.

RIOTS

FATAL CONFLICTS

We have made it our business to collect a faithful narrative of the sanguinary contest that last Saturday night took place at Rawfolds, between the men calling themselves the army of General Ludd and the persons employed in guarding the property of Mr. Cartwright, in order to place upon record the particulars of an event that will survive in local remembrance the present generation; and we can undertake to say, that the following narrative may be implicitly relied upon: —

It is known to our readers that the use of machinery for raising and dressing woollen-cloth has of late become very unpopular amongst the shearmen in this part of the country; and that all mills where machinery this kind is in use have been marked out for destruction, and that in several of them the obnoxious machines have been destroyed.

At Rawfolds, near Cleckheaton, a place at an equal distance from Huddersfield and Leeds, from each of which it is about eight miles, a gentleman of the name of William Cartwright has a mill used for the purpose of dressing cloth in the way objected to by the men; on this mill it was understood that an attempt was to made, and on Thursday night, the 9th inst. the centinel at the mill observed several signals that were supposed to indicate an approaching attack, though both that and the following night passed over without molestation. On Saturday night, about half-past twelve o'clock, there was a firing heard from the north, which was answered from the south, and again from west to east; this firing was accompanied by other signals and in a few minutes a number of armed men surprised the two centinels without the mill, and having secured both their arms and their persons, made violent attack upon the mill, broke in the window-frames, and discharged a volley into the premises at the same instant. Roused by this assault, the guard within the mill flew to arms, and discharged a heavy fire of musketry upon the assailants; this was returned and repeated without intermission during the conflict, the mob attempting all the time to force an entrance, but without success, a number voices crying continually "Bang up!" Murder them!" "Pull down the door!" — and mixing these exclamations with the most horrid imprecations. Again and again the attempts to make a breach were repeated, with a firmness and constancy worthy a better cause; but every renewed attempt ended in disappointment, while the flashes from the fire-arms of the insurgents served to direct the guards in their aim. For about 20 minutes this engagement continued with undiminished fury, till at length, finding all their efforts to enter the mill fruitless, the firing and hammering without began to abate, and soon after the whole body of the assailants retreated with precipitation, leaving on the field such of their wounded as could not join in the retreat. An attempt was made to rally their scattered forces, to carry off their wounded, but it was in vain; the fire from within had been kept up with so much steadiness and perseverance as to produce universal dismay; during this spirited engagement 140 balls were discharged from the mill; what number of shots were fired by the mob, it is impossible to say, but the doors and windows were perforated with a vast number of pistol and musket balls, though none of them took effect, not one of the guards having sustained the least persona] injury. During the principal part of the engagement the alarm-bell was rung, and a quantity of large stones were hurled from the roof, which had an instantaneous effect, otherwise a quantity of oil of vitriol, in reserve, would have been poured down.

On the cessation of the firing, the ears of the guards were assailed with the cries of two unfortunate men, weltering in their blood, and writhing under the torture of mortal wounds:— "For God's sake," cried one of them, "shoot me— put me out of my misery!" — "Oh!" cried the other, "help! help!—I know all, and I will tell all." On the arrival of a detachment of the Queen's Bays, which took place about an hour after the attack commenced, these ill-fated men were removed on litters from the field to the Star Inn, at Robert Town, and medical aid was called in with all possible dispatch. One of them proved to be a cropper, of the name of Hartley, formerly in the employment Mr. Cartwright; a fine-looking young unmarried man, about 24 years of age, and a private the Halifax Local Militia, in which regiment Mr. Cartwright is Captain. The other was John Booth, a youth about 19 years of age, son of a clergyman in Craven, and an apprentice to Mr. Wright, of Huddersfield, tinner. Hartley had received a shot in his left breast, apparently while making a blow at some part of the mill, which, passing through his body, lodged beneath the skin at the left shoulder, from whence it was extracted with a portion of bone. In this situation he languished till three o'clock on Monday morning, when he expired. Booth's wound was in his leg, which was shattered almost to atoms; it was found necessary that he should submit to have the leg amputated, but owing to the extreme loss of blood before the surgeons arrived, spasms came on during the operation, and he died about six o'clock on Sunday morning; having previously observed, that if he should recover, "he would never be brought into such a scrape again." It was observed that neither of these victims of lawless violence manifested any sense of religion. Booth was interred at Huddersfield, on Thursday morning, at six o'clock and Hartley at Halifax, on Wednesday; and they were both attended to their graves by a vast concourse of spectators. `[In the Chester Courant, this last sentence is replaced by: "On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered."]`

On the morning after the engagement a number of hammers, axes, false-keys and picklocks, with two masks, a powder-horn, and a bullet-mould were found upon the field, which was stained in several places with blood: and it is evident that many others besides those left on the field were wounded, as traces of gore were distinctly traced in almost every direction, and in one place to the distance of four miles. The assailants have much to rejoice that they did not succeed in entering the building, from we speak from our own observation when we say, that had they effected an entrance, the death of a vast number of them from a raking fire which they could neither have returned nor confronted, would have been inevitable. It is unnecessary to speak of the heroism of the little band that guarded these premises, there is not perhaps upon record a more distinguished instance of cool intrepidity; but it may be proper to add, that the number of military on the mill was very small, and one of that number conducted himself in so unsoldierlike a manner, that he was on the following morning placed in a confinement, and now awaits the issue of a Regimental Court Martial. `[The Chester Courant differs slightly: *though the assailants exceeded hundred, the numbers opposed to them were very inconsiderable*.]`

A number of reflections arise out this narrative, but we shall content ourselves with one remark: we have of late frequently deemed it our duty, from the regard we feel to the labouring classes, and to the laws of our country, to warn those that are engaged in these violent proceedings, of the fatal consequences that await them in the unequal contest in which they are now waging with the civil and military power of the country. —Let them reflect deeply on the fate of Hartley and Booth—let them recollect that they themselves may be the next victims, and let them stop this desperate career before it is too late.— On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered.

On Thursday se'nnight about twelve o'clock at night, the extensive Cloth Manufactory of Mr. Joshua Foster, of Horbury, was surrounded by a large body of men, armed with muskets, hatchets and clubs, who broke into the Dressing-shops and totally destroyed all the shears and frames and other utensils used in the finishing of cloth; but not content with this, they did considerable injury to the machinery employed in the other part of the business, and respecting which they do not profess to have any ground of complaint. The doors and windows were also broken in pieces, and the damage done to the latter is estimated at 100*l.*. and to conclude the whole, set fire to the premises, but which was happily extinguished before it communicated to the main body of the building At the commencement of these outrages, a party of about twenty broke into the Dwelling-house by the sons of Mr. Foster, whom they treated with the utmost indignity, compelling two of them to get out of bed and lie upon the floor tied together, and obliged the other to give up the keys and go with them to unlock the doors; but this ceremony they might have dispensed with, as the great body of the depredators had already effected many practicable breaches and made an considerable progress in the work of destruction, The Dwelling-house of the Book-keeper was also broken into and his family treated with the most brutal violence. Previous to the assault these assailants had the precaution to secure all the approaches to the premises, and after the work of destruction was completed, their leader assembled them in a neighbouring field, called over the muster-roll, and each man having answered to his number, told them "that their work was done, and all was well, and might disperse." The number assembled on this occasion was about 400, about eight of whom were mounted on horses. Several discharges of fire-arms took place; but it is imagined to be only with powder, as no marks of any shot were observed.

HUDDERSFIELD- This place has been all hurry and confusion during the present week, but no depredations have been committed.— A special sessions was holden here on Monday last, and several persons underwent examinations before the Magistrates respecting the late desperate attack at Mr. Cartwright's mill, but nothing material could be discovered. — The Magistrates came to the resolution of enforcing the Watch and Ward Act in this town.—Booth, who died of his wounds, was interred here at 6 o'clock on Thursday morning, great numbers of people poured in from all quarters during the morning in expectation of seeing the funeral which was over before the majority of them arrived; all is now quiet.— Huddersfield wears the aspect of a town under military power night and day.— What will Napoleon say to this?`[This paragraph was widely syndicated, but the last sentence is typically replaced by "Hartley was interred at Halifax the preceding day with considerable parade; a number of the persons who followed him to his grave were dressed in mourning and wore round their arm a bandage of white crape."]`

Hull Packet - Tuesday 05 May 1812

A person of the name of Haigh was apprehended at Methley on Saturday se'nnight, on suspicion of having been concerned in the late attack upon Mr. Cartwright's mill. This man, who appears to have received a wound from a musket-ball in his shoulder without being able to give any satisfactory account of the cause of that wound, has undergone several examinations before Mr. Radcliffe, of Milnsbridge, and was on Thursday committed to York Castle. On Thursday he passed through Leeds, in a chaise and four, on his way to York, escorted by twelve dragoons. Two other wounded men `[elsewhere (e.g. Pilot (London) - Tuesday 05 May 1812 ) named as "Charles Cockroft and one Stocks"; Stock (sic) was liberated, but Cockroft remanded.]` have been in custody all the week on a similar charge, but we have not heard the result of their examination.

## Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 May 1812

ATROCIUS MURDER. On Tuesday evening last,  at about half past six o'clock, as Mr. WILLIAM HORSFALL a very extensive Wollen Manufacturer at Marsden, about seven miles from Huddersfield, was returning from the market at that place, he was assassinated on the public road, on Crossland Moor.

The circumstances, as stated to us by an eye-witness of this most barbarous Murder are these:— Mr. Horsfall and a Manufacturer, of the name of EASTWOOD, had left Huddersfield together, and at a short distant before they came to the fatal spot, Mr. Eastwood stopped to water his horse, while Mr. Horsfall rode leisurely along the road; when he had came within about 500 yards of the Warren Inn, a distance of about a mile and a half from Huddersfield, on the Manchester road, four men, each armed with a horse pistol, who had just before stepped out of a small plantation, placed the barrels of their pistols in appertures in the wall, apparently prepared for that purpose; the muzzel of two of these pieces Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw, but before he had time to extricate himself from his perilous situation, they all four fired, and inflicted four wounds in the left side of their victim, who instantly fell from his horse, and the blood flowed from the wounds in torrents. A number of passengers both horse and foot rushed almost instantly to the spot, and, after disentangling his foot from the stirrup, he was some difficulty got to the Inn.

The Murderers, after they had perpetrated the sanguinary deed, walked to the distance of some yards, and soon after briskening their speed, they ran towards Dungeon Wood, and entirely escaped undiscovered, no pursuit or search having been made after them, till the arrival of a troop of the Queen's Bays, about three quarters of an hour afterwards. One of the Assassins is described to us as about six feet high, another as a low portly man, and the two others as about five feet six or seven inches high, and rather slender; they all wore dark coarse woollen coats, and appeared to be working men.

From a professional Gentleman, who was called in to visit Mr. Horsfall, we learn, that three of the wounds, out of the four, were slight, and unattended with danger, but the fourth made by a musket ball, which entering the abdomen on the left side had taken a downward direction, and lodged in the back part of the right thigh, from which it was extracted on Wednesday, along with a pistol ball, at which time, some faint hopes were entertained of the patient's recovery; but on Thursday morning, about five o'clock, a profuse bleeding came on, accompanied by mortification, by which the thigh was swollen to an enormous size, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning, he expired, in perfect possession of his faculties.

Mr. Horsfall had a very large Woollen Manufactory at Marsden, wherein about 400 work people were employed; and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting, and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds, and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious in a high degree to the machine destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack on his property, committed a crime against his person, that will embitter every future day of their existence, and, that will, in all probability through the retributive justice of that Being, from whom no secrets are hid, bring the blood-stained perpetrators of this worst of crimes, to an ignominious end.

A reward of £2000 will, we understand, be offered immediately to any person who will give such information as will lead to the conviction of any one or more of the four men concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall.

On Saturday se'ennight a regimental court-martial was held at Huddersfield, on a private who misconducted himself at the attack on Rawfold-mill, in refusing or neglecting to defend it in the manner he might have done. He was found guilty of neglect of duty, and was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. On Tuesday morning he was marched, escorted by a detachment of dragoons, to Rawfold, the scene of action, where he was tied up, and received about 25 lashes, the remainder of his punishment being remitted at the earnest and repeated intercession of Mr Cartwright.

On Saturday se'ennight an attempt was made to assassinate Mr Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfold's Mill, by two villains who fired at him from behind a hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect.

Caledonian Mercury - Thursday 07 May 1812


[ATROCIOUS MURDER article from Leeds Mercury, prefaced with:

We formerly mentioned, that Mr Horsfall, of Marsden, had been waylaid, on his return home from market, by a gang of villains, by whom he was fired at and severely wounded. We are sorry to learn, by the following account, extracted, from the Leeds Mercury of Saturday last, that Mr Horsfall has since died of his wounds.

...

Mr Cartwright, who so bravely defended his property in Yorkshire, has been fired at on three distinct occasions but without doing him the slightest injury.

Mr Trentham, notwithstanding his alarming wound, is likely to recover. The Luddites have had the audacity to placard the streets of Nottingham in the night, offering a reward for Mr Wilson, the mayor, dead or alive. He had committed no offence than signing the offer of a reward of L.600 from the Corporation of Nottingham, for the discovery of the assassin who shot Mr Trentham. — These infatuated men are said actually to meet in the streets of Nottingham, in small parties, in the daytime, and triumphantly talk over their nightly depredations.

The Gazette of last Saturday offers his Majesty's pardon, and a reward of L.2000, for the conviction of the persons who shot Mr W. Horsfall, of Marsden, near Huddersfield, on Tuesday se'ennight, of which wounds he is since dead.— Also L. 600 reward, and a pardon, for the person who fired at Mr W Trentham, of Nottingham, on the evening of Monday se'ennight, as he was knocking at his own door, and wounded him in the breast.— L.100 for the person who discharged a gun at Mr J. Rayner, of Lendthwaite, West Riding, on the 23d April, the ball of which went through his hat.— 100 guineas, and a pardon, for the discovery of the person who discharged a gun at Mr. E. Whitehead, deputy constable, at Huddersfield, as he was going to bed, on the 15th ult.— And L.200 for the conviction of the persons who, on the night of the 21st of March, fired upon the boat's crew of his Majesty's schooner Pioneer, after she had chased three smuggling galleys on shore between Walmer and Deal, and by which two of them escaped.

Accounts from Manchester state, that another mill has been burned near that town, and a woman, who offered to give evidence against the criminals, was shot, while the military were escorting her to the magistrate.

Letters from different parts concur in stating, that the great tumults have subsided, but that shocking outrages are committed by small parties of depredators and assassins.

The most urgent representations, we hear, have within these few days been made to Government, that a renewal of disturbances might be expected in the northern counties, unless a greater proportion of troops was immediately sent down and quartered in those districts. It is said to have been ascertained by the Magistracy, that a regular organization had commenced in several places, and even oaths of fidelity and secrecy been administered to these deluded people. During the last week, not fewer than seven regiments have proceeded towards Cheshire and Lancashire. The provincial papers are filled with accounts of the movements of the military.

A Special Commission will shortly be sent down to Chester and Lancaster to try the rioters (about 30) who have been committed to gaol in those counties.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 12 May 1812

Committed to York Castle.— James Haigh, of Dalton, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Joseph Ardron, and other persons, as strongly suspected of having been one of the persons who, on the night of the 11th of April, riotously assembled and attacked the mill of Mr. W. Cartwright, at Rawfolds. —This man was apprehended Methley, on Saturday week. It appears that since the attack above mentioned, he had been first at the house of a sister in-law, at Penistone, from whence he went to another sister at Methley. He was taken before Joseph Esq. of Milnsbridge, and after undergoing several examinations was fully committed on Thursday. He was conveyed to the Cattle in a chaise and four, escorted by a party of dragoons. —Two other men were apprehended as accomplices at Hill-House, near Huddersfield, on Monday evening, after several examinations, one of them named Stocks was liberated, but the other, Cockroft, was remanded.—On Monday night, it is strongly suspected, with a view to the rescue of the above men, the stable of Major Gordon, at Huddersfield, was set on fire, and nearly destroyed. The stratagem, however, failed; for instead of drawing away the guard which was placed over the prisoners, the officer, with great promptitude, doubled its force. Happily the fire did not communicate to any other building.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 13 April 1812

ATTACK ON RAWFOLDS MILL — REPULSE OF THE ASSAILANTS

The following account of the affair at Mr. Cartwright's mill, at Rawfolds, between Cleckheaton and Littletown, may be depended upon as correct.

About 20 or 30 minutes after twelve o'clock, on Saturday night, the Gig-Mill was attacked by the Luddites or Snappers, and the windows and door of the mill were assailed by a furious mob, who commenced their attack by the firing of arms and the beating of hammers and hatchets. The guard in the mill instantly repelled the assault by steady, firm and well-directed discharge of musquetry from within. A regular engagement succeeded, which continued from 15 to 20 minutes, during which time, not fewer than 140 shot were discharged from within. The assailants were foiled their attempt to force the windows or doors, and did no other damage than break the glass windows of the mill. The deluded mob did not escape unhurt. Two of the unhappy men were left wounded upon the spot, and there is great reason to believe that several more received the contents of the defenders' muskets, as traces of blood have been observed. The two wounded men were put under the care of surgeons as soon as could be done; one of them, John Booth, a tinner's apprentice, at Huddersfield, died after having had his leg amputated. Samuel Hartley, a cropper, Huddersfield, who worked with one Web or Webster, at the same place, (and formerly with Mr. Cartwright, at Halifax) was shot through the breast; he died yesterday afternoon.

From the direction of the shot, it is conjectured that he received his wound in the act of firing into the mill, or in an attitude similar to that of firing a musket.

Several hammers, masks and a picklock key were left upon the premises. Both of the men died without making any confession of their accomplices; but several must have been so wounded as to lead to the knowledge of them.

FRAME BREAKING

About midnight on Sunday, the *Luddites* resumed their work of destruction in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield.— They were in considerable force, armed, and their faces blacked. The first sufferer was Mr. Smith, of Snowgate-Head, near Holmfirth: the rioters broke all his shears and dressing-frames.— Horn Coat, about a mile distant, was the next place of action: there they destroyed the frames and shears of Mr. Joseph Brook, broke his windows and demolished his furniture. Mr. James Brook, of Reins, near Honley, three miles from the last place, had also one frame broken, the only one he had, and which had been taken down several weeks. This was near two o'clock; about which time they dispersed, without breaking his shears.

All these outrages, and much worse, are perpetrated without the detection even of a single individual: and, this escaping, the offenders seem, as must naturally be expected, to increase in strength and daring.

On Thursday at midnight, about 300 of this desperate men, some undisguised, some having their faces covered; some with fire-arms; some with hatchets, and many with clubs, surrounded the factory of Mr. Joseph Foster, at Horbury, near Wakefield, broke into different parts of the shops and houses adjoining, destroyed the frames and shears, broke the windows and iron-window-frames, damaged a quantity of warp in the loops, and even wreaked their vengeance on the machinery in the scribbling mill.— whole this was going on, another party broke open the house occupied by the sons of Mr. Foster, in the most outrageous manner. They dragged two of the young men out of bed, tied them together on the floor, and made a third accompany them with keys, threatening on refusal, to put him instantly to death. The book-keeper's house was also broken into, and himself and family treated most brutally. And the miscreants departed setting the premises on fire! This was happily prevented from extending far: that whole damage is stated at 700*l.* The men were called over by numbers as before and dispersed. Many of them were met on the Huddersfield road upon Grange Moor returning about three o'clock. Others went through Horbury on the Wakefield road, saluting the house of Mr. Foster, sen., with a volley, as they passed, to his great alarm, as he has for some time been an invalid. It is said that Mr. F. intends to apply to the County for reparation. No military were stationed nearer than within 11 miles. This machinery of Mr. Foster's, we understand, has been at work several years.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 April 1812

On Saturday, a regimental Court martial was held at Huddersfield, on the private, who mis-conducted himself at the attack on Rawfolds mill, in refusing or neglecting to defend it in the manner he ought to have done, he was guilty of neglect of duty, and was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. On Tuesday morning, he was marched, escorted by a detachment of dragoons, to Rawfold the scene of action, where he was tied up, and received about 25 lashes, the remainder of his punishment being remitted at the earnest and repeated intercession of Mr. Cartwright.

On Saturday last, an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfolds Mill, by two villains who fired at him from behind an hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. This diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman, took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile on this side of Huddersfield. We have no words which can sufficiently describe our abhorrence of this dark and wicked attempt to murder. Surely, even the deluded followers of Gen. Ludd, cannot approve of private deliberate murder; are his troops already degenerated into a band of assassins? But wickedness is progressive, it is a downward road, the first step prepares the mind for a second, that for a third, until deeds of blood become familiar. And the man who begun his career, probably with the intention only of destroying machinery which he supposed inimical to his interest, ends it by deliberate assassination, There is something in this crime so cowardly, so foreign to the feelings of Englishmen, and so much at variance with the courage and humanity of our national character, that we are convinced, that not one man would have been found to have entered into the association, if it had previously intimated to him, that he was to exchange the character of an Englishman, for that of a cruel and cowardly Italian desperado. We would exhort and conjure those who are yet innocent of the blood of their fellow-creatures, to abjure a confederation which leads to such dreadful consequences, which sinks them below the level of civilized men, and points to the destruction of Society itself. It is at present possible to retreat; when we have next to address them, it may be too late.

The Committee of the association of Merchants and Manufacturers at Huddersfield, hove voted their thanks to Mr. Cartwright, for his intrepid and gallant conduct in the defence of his Mill at Rawfolds, by which he has rendered the most essential service to his country. The Committee have also presented Fifty Guineas to the men, under the command of Mr. Cartwright, for having so bravely and steadily performed their duty in this trying occasion

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 27 June 1812

Our Huddersfield Correspondent under the date of the 25th instant says:—

"Last Monday about midnight, a great number of armed men, with their faces disfigured by broad black marks down each cheek and over the forehead, assembled near the dwelling-house of Mr. Fisher, a shop-keeper, at Briestwistle, in this neighbourhood, and after firing two guns or pistols, demanded admittance into Mr. Fisher's house, which he refused. They then broke open the door, and wo of them rushing into the house, seized Mr. Fisher, who had just got out of bed; they each presented a pistol to his breast, and threatened him with instant death if he stirred a foot. Not intimidated by this threat, Mr. Fisher rushed from them towards the door, when he was seized by other six men, who placing a sheet over his head, face and arms, kept him in that situation while their comrades ransacked the house, and took from his pocket-book bills to the amount of the 116*l.* besides 21*l.* in notes and some cash; they also took a quantity of notes and cash out of a drawer, but to what amount Mr. Fisher does not exactly know. When the depredation was completed, the Leader cried out to the guard placed over Mr. Fisher, "Let him go; don't hurt him; we have got what we wanted, and we will bring it back in three months," and immediately made off.

A man of the name of James Oldroyd, was apprehended at Dewsbury, on Tuesday evening last, by a troop of the Queen's Bays, sent from hence for that purpose, on suspicion of having been concerned in the attack on Mr. Cartwright's Mill at Rawfolds. He underwent an examination yesterday morning, at Mills-Bridge *(sic)*, before Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. when he was committed to York-Castle to take his trial at the ensuing Assizes.

It has been determined to appoint a special commission for the trial of the persons accused of the murder of Mr Horsfall, and of the Luddites now confined in York Castle, to the number of between 40 and 50. The trials will take place, we believe, in about three weeks.
