THE TRIALS FOR TREASON

On Saturday, the *Morning Chronicle* asserted. that our from Derby were designed, not merely •* uJ «« the case of th« prisoners, but to inflame the public mind against them.** This is charge which may made against the publication of any account of the crimes with which they are accused. At this rate.no* thing should ever appear respecting any accused person, until trial is coocl-sded. Yet all the papersarc daily filled with Police Reports io the face of this rule. Why publish examinations before Magistrates; why publish bills of indictment before trial ? It is particularly complained, that on Thursday, our Derby Letter began thus, tb* town all buttle and confusion, arising from the commencement of the Quarter Sessions, and the arrival of the period appointed for the trial of tiiose unfortunate men, who by a series of the most wanton and outrageous acta, on the June last, threw this and the adjoining county into a state the utmost terror and alarm.” It is also complained, that we said places of religious worship had been chosen for the assemblage of the seditions, though that fact was affirmed io the sermon preached before the Judges previous the Court’s opening. And What crime is there in saying, the men going on trial are those who committed the excesses on the 9di of June ? not the bill of indictment say they same? Have not all the Newspaper details, reports and rumours said the same ? Has not the same been said hundred times over by every Newspaper in England ? The very fact of sending the men trial authorises the assertion. Is there nan in England who, on such a fact, or on such an assertion, would doom the men to death ? No, certainly. That can only be done by a Jury, after a minute and impartial investigation of the evidence on both sides.— The Magistracy decide, in the first instance, such charges »o be sufficient send such men to trial. After this, how can newspapers speak of them but as the so accused ? While we are censured for speaking these men in similar terms to those which all other newspapers have used respecting them, let see how the complaining Warning Chronicle has been basely endeavouring to defeat the justice of its country, assertions'of their innocence, by insinuations that tltey were instigated by Oliver, &c. in publications timed to have an effect at the moment trial.

It will seen by the account of the proceedings at Derby, that another of the individuals (*Wm. Turner*) charged with High Treason, has been found Guilty.— To excite pity for a convicted traitor, some of the journals still insinuate that the Jury were influenced by accounts in this Paper of the proceedings on the trial, as if they, who had witnessed the whole, whom every passing was addressed, should not know more than what are called "garbled extracts" could inform them ! The trial began on Thursday ; nothing respecting the proceedings on it could appear in this Paper till Friday, and on Saturday, three or four hours before the Friday's Papers could arrive, the Jury had given their verdict. The London mail reaches Derby at two o’clock, and the Jury had pronounced their decision before twelve.

The *Morning Chronicle* boasts of having ever supported the cause of humanity. Humanity ! Is it humanity to advocate the cause assassins and traitors, endeavouring spread fire and desolation over the land? Two days before *Brandreth*'s' trial, it argued his case over in a letter, signed and pronounced him innocent: it contended he was a dupe of Oliver's artifices, he, this *Brandreth*, who appears to be one the most atrocious ruffians of the assassinating gang of Reformers. This was the *Chronicle*'s "humanity." It would have let loose upon us a sanguinary ruffian, a murderer. To-day it says— "Justice requires that Jurors should not be prejudiced who are to sit on the trial of their fellow-creatures;" and it obeys its own maxim by shewing to the Jury going try a man, that the man is innocent!—that he was only the dupe of OLIVER, though Oliver's name was never mentioned on the trial." All this canting and clamour, and misrepresentation, is designed, no doubt, to answer the same purpose as Fitzwilliam's Letter, to prejudge the innocence of the men yet to tried.
