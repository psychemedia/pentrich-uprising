{\small \textbf{A Luddite Oath}\\I, ——— , of my own free will and accord do hereby promise and swear that I will never reveal any of the names of any one of this secret Committee, under the penalty of being sent out of this world by the first Brother that may meet me. I furthermore do swear, that I will pursue with unceasing vengeance any Traitors or Traitor, should there any arise, should he fly to the verge of ——I furthermore do swear that I will be sober and faithful, in all my dealings with all my Brothers, and if ever I decline them, my name to be blotted out from the list of Society and never to be remembered, but with contempt and abhorrence, so help me God to keep this our Oath inviolate.}

{\small \textbf{Portion of Blanketeers' Petition}

{\footnotesize... This state of things, we, your Petitioners, attribute to the rapid increase of taxation, which has been quadrupled, together with the increase of rent, which has probably, been doubled during the war; which, together so nearly absorb the whole produce of the kingdom, as to leave a quantity very far short of being sufficient to keep your Petitioners in existence, and therefore their lives are now become a burden and a plague to them; your distressed Petitioners are further convinced, that if the House of Commons had really emanated from, and been wholly and annually appointed by, the People at large, this war, and the taxation resulting therefrom, would long ago have received a sufficient check, even admitting the nation have sanctioned its commencement— that the laws to regulate the importation of corn, calculated to advance its price, would never have been suffered to pass—that the law of libel, which subjects the publishers of truth in some instances to great pains and penalties, thereby preventing the publication of the most important truths, could never have received the sanction of the friends of truth and mankind— that a Bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, a Bill empowering Ministers to imprison, without proof of guilt, whomsoever they please, and for an unknown length time—could never have passed.\\Your Petitioners therefore humbly, but fervently, pray, that your Highness will instantly dismiss from your Councils all those Ministers who have advised or devised such cruel, such unjust measures,... If you procure the adoption of measures calculated to relieve us, you may then safely rely upon our support and gratitude— WITHOUT THIS, WE CAN NEITHER SUPPORT YOU NOR OURSELVES.}
