RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM

For some time past the Wholesale Hosiers, who have Stocking-weaving Establishments in the county of Nottingham, have been obliged to curtail their hands; this produced considerable discontent among the workmen. Their riotous spirit was, however, increased by the trade having brought into use a certain wide frame for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, which, was a considerable saving in manual labour, leading still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday se'nnight last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinity of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as used particular frames.

A letter dated Nottingham, the 14th inst. communicates, that the late hands in particular were in a very distressed situation, and under the necessity of applying for parochial relief. A master weaver, at Buttlwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday, armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames. The master would agree to neither, and was immediately fired upon ;- several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life he was in the act of *tearing* down the window-shutters to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength. They broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death had they not escaped by a back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed every thing that would burn.

On Tuesday, the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to Maltby and Brewett, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they took to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the street.

Other letters state, that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob belonged to Messrs. Watson and Nelson, and produced 24 dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.

In the afternoon of Tuesday, the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages there; and that evening they destroyed the frames of the principal weavers.

On the Wednesday morning, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill.— Having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, they grew bolder, and changed the frame-breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide-frames, millers, corn-dealers, &c.

On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the *posse comitatis*, and the First and Second Regiments of Local Militia, an a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three on Friday morning.

All Thursday was employed in assembling together the Militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriff; during this time the mob were enabled to carry on their depredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town was left for a moment unprotected they would make a sudden attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.

On Friday morning intelligence was received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberley, because they were worked by women.

Many persons concerned in these proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed.

The High Sheriff, with the advice of the County Magistrates, has called in the Home Pierrepoint, and Bunny troops of Yeomanry Cavalry, whose services, with a detachment of the 4th Dragoons from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the First Regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry are in readiness to act. The Magistrates are every where at their posts. Some hundreds of special Constables have been sworn in.

On Thursday the body of *John Westley* a native of Leicester, the man who was shot in Sunday night at Bulwell, was removed to Arnold for interment, where he has resided for about twelve years ; and where he has left two orphans, one five and the other three years of age, to bewail his untimely end : their mother having been dead some time. In the afternoon the funeral took place, and the scene was truly awful. The High Sheriff, the Under Sheriff, and about half a dozen Magistrates were on the spot, attended by a *posse* of Constables, and about thirty mounted Dragoons, who all proceeded with the funeral to the church-yard; but before the body was removed the Riot Act was read in several parts of the town. From seven hundred to a thousand persons attended on the occasion: the corpse was preceded by a number of the deceased's former club mates, bearing black wands, decked with knots of crape,—Sorrow seemed to have seated itself upon every brow, and a solemn silence, still as death, was only interrupted by the trampling of the multitude, the bell's heavy knoll, and a band of music playing a solemn dirge, accompanied at distant intervals by the beating of a bass drum !! About the time that the corpse was lowering into the grave, the High Sheriff proclaimed that an hour had elapsed since the reading of the Riot Act, and informed the multitude, that those who did not instantly disperse, should be taken into custody as rioters; and two were actually seized who did not immediately obey, but we believe, were shortly set at liberty; and the whole concourse quietly disbursed. Many more we understand were wounded in the various conflicts, and reports have stated several others to have lost their lives, but which reports, we hope are unfounded.

The most recent accounts from Nottingham left that town and neighbourhood free from tumult, in consequence of the strong military force assembled in that quarter. The workmen still, however, urge their complaints and what they call their rights. At a late meeting, held at the sign of the Sir Isaac Newton, the frame-work knitters came to several resolutions: among others, that their earnings as frame-knitters were inferior to those of any other class of mechanics: that the present grievances were as much to be attributed to the *irresolute* conduct in themselves, in not standing forward for the rights of the trade, as to an imposing principle on the part of their employers; and that they would resist impositions in future. On the 18th inst. another meeting was to take place, but we have not learnt the result.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 December 1811

Nottingham, Dec. 12- The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has no parallel in history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. Day after day have the Magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility ; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil powers, and called in additional aid of the military; but hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail ; a mysterious organization has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. — The rioters appear suddenly, in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of who, being whomsoever he may, is stiled *General Ludd*, and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of the Monarch. Indeed it is well understood, that disobedience to his commands is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organized band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already being inflicted, by the burning of haystacks, &c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and so few of the depredators apprehended.

The following article, on the same subject, is from the *Statesman* Newspaper, and is of so alarming a complexion as to induce a hope that there is some degree of exaggeration:—

*December 15*— There are 20,000 stocking-makers out of employment. Six regiments of soldiers from different parts of the country have been sent into this town; and 300 new constables have been sworn in to keep the peace. But all this is of no avail as the practice of setting fire to corn and hay stacks, and breaking open houses still continues. Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken, which cost £140 each; from twenty to thirty of them are destroyed in a night. The whole country, for twenty miles around, is full of these ruinous proceedings, nor can they be checked, Nottingham gaol is full of debtors; and the country is equally distressed. no trade; no money. This has been the case for two months. This town is now a garrison, and strictly under martial law. God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin. 

Later accounts down to the 18th inst. state that no advantage has resulted from the expected Meeting of the manufacturers, but that the parties broke up without coming to any decision.

23rd November 1811: Editorial in the Leeds Mercury

We are more concerned than surprised to find, that a Spirit of Riot and Insubordination has broken out in the county of Nottingham amongst the suffering Manufacturers. As it frequently happens on such occasions, the cause of the distress of these unfortunate people is mistaken; they imagine, it seems, that the low rate of wages and the scarcity of work arise from some improvement in the Stocking weaving Frames, and their vengeance is directed against the owners of these inoffensive implements of labour; but they ought to be informed that the real cause of the evils of which they so loudly and justly complain, is the long continuance of a heart-sickening war, without visible object, and apparently without end, and which has in its consequences damned up all the regular outlets of trade; and if instead of sacking the workshops of their employers, who are in general deep participators in the sufferings of the labouring classes, they would unite with the other manufacturers throughout the kingdom in petitioning the proper authorities, first to inform them what it is we are fighting for; and secondly, if the object does not justify the sacrifices, to put a stop to the horrors and miseries of this contest, they would act much more wisely and have a much better chance of seeing an end of their grievances, than by their present lawless and senseless proceedings. We do most sincerely commiserate their situation, but we utterly condemn the means by which they seek to obtain redress.

RIOTS

FATAL CONFLICTS

We have made it our business to collect a faithful narrative of the sanguinary contest that last Saturday night took place at Rawfolds, between the men calling themselves the army of General Ludd and the persons employed in guarding the property of Mr. Cartwright, in order to place upon record the particulars of an event that will survive in local remembrance the present generation ; and we can undertake to say, that the following narrative may be implicitly relied upon : —

It is known to our readers that the use of machinery for raising and dressing woollen-cloth has of late become very unpopular amongst the shearmen in this part of the country ; and that all mills where machinery this kind is in use have been marked out for destruction, and that in several of them the obnoxious machines have been destroyed.

At Rawfolds, near Cleckheaton, a place at an equal distance from Huddersfield and Leeds, from each of which it is about eight miles, a gentleman of the name of William Cartwright has a mill used for the purpose of dressing cloth in the way objected to by the men; on this mill it was understood that an attempt was to made, and on Thursday night, the 9th inst. the centinel at the mill observed several signals that were supposed to indicate an approaching attack, though both that and the following night passed over without molestation. On Saturday night, about half-past twelve o'clock, there was a firing heard from the north, which was answered from the south, and again from west to east ; this firing was accompanied by other signals and in a few minutes a number of armed men surprised the two centinels without the mill, and having secured both their arms and their persons, made violent attack upon the mill, broke in the window-frames, and discharged a volley into the premises at the same instant. Roused by this assault, the guard within the mill flew to arms, and discharged a heavy fire of musketry upon the assailants; this was returned and repeated without intermission during the conflict, the mob attempting all the time to force an entrance, but without success, a number voices crying continually "Bang up! " Murder them !" " Pull down the door!" — and mixing these exclamations with the most horrid imprecations. Again and again the attempts to make a breach were repeated, with a firmness and constancy worthy a better cause; but every renewed attempt ended in disappointment, while the flashes from the fire-arms of the insurgents served to direct the guards in their aim. For about 20 minutes this engagement continued with undiminished fury, till at length, finding all their efforts to enter the mill fruitless, the firing and hammering without began to abate, and soon after the whole body of the assailants retreated with precipitation, leaving on the field such of their wounded as could not join in the retreat. An attempt was made to rally their scattered forces, to carry off their wounded, but it was in vain ; the fire from within had been kept up with so much steadiness and persevercnce as to produce universal dismay ; during this spirited engagement 140 balls were discharged from the mill ; what number of shots were fired by the mob, it is impossible to say, but the doors and windows were perforated with a vast number of pistol and musket balls, though none of them took effect, not one of the guards having sustained the least persona] injury. During the principal part of the engagement the alarm-bell was rung, and a quantity of large stones were hurled from the roof, which had an instantaneous effect, otherwise a quantity of oil of vitriol, in reserve, would have been poured down.

On the cessation of the firing, the ears of the guards were assailed with the cries of two unfortunate men, weltering in their blood, and writhing under the torture of mortal wounds:— "For God's sake," cried one of them, " shoot me— put me out of my misery!" — "Oh !" cried the other, " help ! help !—I know all, and I will tell all." On the arrival of a detachment of the Queen's Bays, which took place about an hour after the attack commenced, these ill-fated men were removed on litters from the field to the Star Inn, at Robert Town, and medical aid was called in with all possible dispatch. One of them proved to be a cropper, of the name of Hartley, formerly in the employment Mr. Cartwright; a fine-looking young unmarried man, about 24 years of age, and a private the Halifax Local Militia, in which regiment Mr. Cartwright is Captain. The other was John Booth, a youth about 19 years of age, son of a clergyman in Craven, and an apprentice to Mr. Wright, of Huddersfield, tinner. Hartley had received a shot in his left breast, apparently while making a blow at some part of the mill, which, passing through his body, lodged beneath the skin at the left shoulder, from whence it was extracted with a portion of bone. In this situation he languished till three o'clock on Monday morning, when he expired. Booth's wound was in his leg, which was shattered almost to atoms ; it was found necessary that he should submit to have the leg amputated, but owing to the extreme loss of blood before the surgeons arrived, spasms came on during the operation, and he died about six o'clock on Sunday morning ; having previously observed, that if he should recover, "he would never be brought into such a scrape again." It was observed that neither of these victims of lawless violence manifested any sense of religion. Booth was interred at Huddersfield, on Thursday morning, at six o'clock and Hartley at Halifax, on Wednesday; and they were both attended to their graves by a vast concourse of spectators. `[In the Chester Courant, this last sentence is replaced by: "On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered."]`

On the morning after the engagement a number of hammers, axes, false-keys and picklocks, with two masks, a powder-horn, and a bullet-mould were found upon the field, which was stained in several places with blood: and it is evident that many others besides those left on the field were wounded, as traces of gore were distinctly traced in almost every direction, and in one place to the distance of four miles. The assailants have much to rejoice that they did not succeed in entering the building, from we speak from our own observation when we say, that had they effected an entrance, the death of a vast number of them from a raking fire which they could neither have returned nor confronted, would have been inevitable. It is unnecessary to speak of the heroism of the little band that guarded these premises, there is not perhaps upon record a more distinguished instance of cool intrepidity ; but it may be proper to add, that the number of military on the mill was very small, and one of that number conducted himself in so unsoldierlike a manner, that he was on the following morning placed in a confinement, and now awaits the issue of a Regimental Court Martial. `[The Chester Courant differes slightly: *though the assailants exceeded hundred, the numbers opposed to them were very inconsiderable*.]`

A number of reflections arise out this narrative, but we shall content ourselves with one remark : we have of late frequently deemed it our duty, from the regard we feel to the labouring classes, and to the laws of our country, to warn those that are engaged in these violent proceedings, of the fatal consequences that await them in the unequal contest in which they are now waging with the civil and military power of the country. —Let them reflect deeply on the fate of Hartley and Booth—let them recollect that they themselves may be the next victims, and let them stop this desperate career before it is too late.— On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered.

On Thursday se'nnight about twelve o'clock at night, the extensive Cloth Manufactory of Mr. Joshua Foster, of Horbury, was surrounded by a large body of men, armed with muskets, hatchets and clubs, who broke into the Dressing-shops and totally destroyed all the shears and frames and other utensils used in the finishing of cloth; but not content with this, they did considerable injury to the machinery employed in the other part of the business, and respecting which they do not profess to have any ground of complaint. The doors and windows were also broken in pieces, and the damage done to the latter is estimated at 100*l.*. and to conclude the whole, set fire to the premises, but which was happily extinguished before it communicated to the main body of the building At the commencement of these outrages, a party of about twenty broke into the Dwelling-house by the sons of Mr. Foster, whom they treated with the utmost indignity, compelling two of them to get out of bed and lie upon the floor tied together, and obliged the other to give up the keys and go with them to unlock the doors; but this ceremony they might have dispensed with, as the great body of the depredators had already effected many practicable breaches and made an considerable progress in the work of destruction, The Dwelling-house of the Book-keeper was also broken into and his family treated with the most brutal violence. Previous to the assault these assailants had the precaution to secure all the approaches to the premises, and after the work of destruction was completed, their leader assembled them in a neighbouring field, called over the muster-roll, and each man having answered to his number, told them " that their work was done, and all was well, and might disperse." The number assembled on this occasion was about 400, about eight of whom were mounted on horses. Several discharges of fire-arms took place ; but it is imagined to be only with powder, as no marks of any shot were observed.

HUDDERSFIELD- This place has been all hurry and confusion during the present week, but no depredations have been committed.— A special sessions was holden here on Monday last, and several persons underwent examinations before the Magistrates respecting the late desperate attack at Mr. Cartwright's mill, but nothing material could be discovered. — The Magistrates came to the resolution of enforcing the Watch and Ward Act in this town.—Booth, who died of his wounds, was interred here at 6 o'clock on Thursday morning, great numbers of people poured in from all quarters during the morning in expectation of seeing the funeral which was over before the majority of them arrived ; all is now quiet.— Huddersfield wears the aspect of a town under military power night and day.— What will Napoleon say to this ? `[This paragraph was widely syndicated, but the last sentence is replaced by "Hartley was interred at Halifax the preceding day with considerable parade; a number of the persons who followed him to his grave were dressed in mourning and wore round their arm a bandage of white crape."]`

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 April 1812

On Saturday, a regimental Court martial was held at Huddersfield, on the private, who mis-conducted himself at the attack on Rawfolds mill, in refusing or neglecting to defend it in the manner he ought to have done, he was guilty of neglect of duty, and was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. On Tuesday morning, he was marched, escorted by a detachment of dragoons, to Rawfold the scene of action, where he was tied sip, and received about 25 lashes, the remainder of his punishment being remitted at the earnest and repeated intercession of Mr. Cartwright.

On Saturday last, an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfolds Mill, by two villains who fired at him from behind an hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. This diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman, took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile on this side of Huddersfield. We have no words which can sufficiently describe our abhorrence of this dark and wicked attempt to murder. Surely, even the deluded followers of Gen. Ludd, cannot approve of private deliberate murder ; are his troops already degenerated into a band of assassins? But wickedness is progressive, it is a downward road, the first step prepares the mind for a second, that for a third, until deeds of blood become familiar. And the man who begun his career, probably with the intention only of destroying machinery which he supposed inimical to his interest, ends it by deliberate assassination, There is something in this crime so cowardly, so foreign to the feelings of Englishmen, and so much at variance with the courage and humanity of our national character, that we are convinced, that not one man would have been found to have entered into the association, if it had previously intimated to him, that he was to exchange the character of an Englishman, for that of a cruel and cowardly Italian desperado. We would exhort and conjure those who are yet innocent of the blood of their fellow-creatures, to abjure a confederation which leads to such dreadful consequences, which sinks them below the level of civilized men, and points to the destruction of Society itself. It is at present possible to retreat ; when we have next to address them, it may be too late.

The Committee of the association of Merchants and Manufacturers at Huddersfield, hove voted their thanks to Mr. Cartwright, for his intrepid and gallant conduct in the defence of his Mill at Rawfolds, by which he has rendered the most essential service to his country. The Committee have also presented Fifty Guineas to the men, under the command of Mr. Cartwright, for having so bravely and steadily performed their duty in this trying occasion

ATROCIUS MURDER. On Tuesday evening last,  at about half past six o'clock, as Mr. WILLIAM HORSFALL a very extensive Wollen Manufacturer at Marsden, about seven miles from Huddersfield, was returning from the market at that place, he was assassinated on the public road, on Crossland Moor.

The circumstances, as stated to us by an eye-witness of this most barbarous Murder are these:— Mr. Horsfall and a Manufacturer, of the name of EASTWOOD, had left Huddersfield together, and at a short distant before they came to the fatal spot, Mr. Eastwood stopped to water his horse, while Mr. Horsfall rode leisurely along the road; when he had came within about 500 yards of the Warren Inn, a distance of about a mile and a half from Huddersfield, on the Manchester road, four men, each armed with a horse pistol, who had just before stepped out of a small plantation, placed the barrels of their pistols in appertures in the wall, apparently prepared for that purpose; the muzzel of two of these pieces Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw, but before he had time to extricate himself from his perilous situation, they all four fired, and inflicted four wounds in the left side of their victim, who instantly fell from his horse, and the blood flowed from the wounds in torrents. A number of passengers both horse and foot rushed almost instantly to the spot, and, after disentangling his foot from the stirrup, he was some difficulty got to the Inn.

The Murderers, after they had perpetrated the sanguinary deed, walked to the distance of some yards, and soon after briskening their speed, they ran towards Dungeon Wood, and entirely escaped undiscovered, no pursuit or search having been made after them, till the arrival of a troop of the Queen's Bays, about three quarters of an hour afterwards. One of the Assassins is described to us as about six feet high, another as a low portly man, and the two others as about five feet six or seven inches high, and rather slender; they all wore dark coarse woollen coats, and appeared to be working men.

From a professional Gentleman, who was called in to visit Mr. Horsfall, we learn, that three of the wounds, out of the four, were slight, and unattended with danger, but the fourth made by a musket ball, which entering the abdomen on the left side had taken a downward direction, and lodged in the back part of the right thigh, from which it was extracted on Wednesday, along with a pistol ball, at which time, some faint hopes were entertained of the patient's recovery ; but on Thursday morning, about five o'clock, a profuse bleeding came on, accompanied by mortification, by which the thigh was swollen to an enormous size, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning, he expired, in perfect possession of his faculties.

Mr. Horsfall had a very large Woollen Manufactory at Marsden, wherein about 400 work people were employed ; and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection ; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting, and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds, and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious in a high degree to the machine destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack on his property, committed a crime against his person, that will embitter every future day of their existence, and, that will, in all probability through the retributive justice of that Being, from whom no secrets are hid, bring the blood-stained perpetrators of this worst of crimes, to an ignominious end.

A reward of £2000 will, we understand, be offered immediately to any person who will give such information as will lead to the conviction of any one or more of the four men concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall.

Huddersfield, May 7, 1812  

MR EDITOR—I am sorry to inform you the Luddites have been very active in collecting arms this last week, and have been too successful. They proceeded to peoples' houses, in the townships of Almondbury, Wooldale, Farnley, Netherthong. Meltham, Honley, and Marsden, and many other places in this neighbourhood ; they entered the houses by about 20 or 30 in a gang, and demanded all the arms in the house, on pain of instant death. By this means they have obtained possession of upwards of 100 stand of arms since my last letter to you, and not one night has passed without some arms having been so taken. In order to check this alarming evil, Major Gordon has obtained possession of 200 stand of arms from the inhabitants in this neighbourhood ; the military are in this manner daily employed in collecting arms, but they have not yet been fortunate enough to discover the depot of the Luddites.

A person, who appears a very suspicious character, was apprehended in Saddleworth, last Tuesday. and committed to Towzer here, and who will undergo an examination before the magistrates here tomorrow.

The Coroner's Inquest sat on the body of Mr. Horsfall last Thursday, and returned a verdict of *Wilful Murder* against some person or persons unknown. He was interred at Huddersfield parish-church, in a very private manner, last Saturday morning— few people knew till the funeral was over. It is presumed the business will be carried on at Marsden as usual.

You was misinformed with respect to Major Gordon's stable set on fire; the stable belonged to Mr. Allen Edwards, King-street, who wishes this mistake to be rectified; Mr. Edwards is a special constable, and had rendered himself obnoxious to the incendiaries by the vigilant discharge of his duty.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 11 July 1812

We have considered it our duty to inquire, with more than ordinary diligence, into the reports of discoveries made, and excesses committed in this county, during the last ten days, some of which, in a very exaggerated form, have found their way into the London Papers, and the following is the result of our inquiries:

On the 20th ult. the Luddites, about twenty in number, entered the house of Mr. John Wood, a shopkeeper at Huddersfield, and carried away a pistol and a small cask of gunpowder. On Friday the 3d est. parties of the same description, entered the houses of Mr. Benjamin Dyson and Mr. Wm. Mellor, of Stainiland, near Halifax, and took from each a gun and a sword. The same night, another party, about ten in number, armed and disguised, several of them with their shirts over their coats, attacked the family of Mr. Megson, a carpenter, residing near the Porter's-Lodge, at Whitley-Hall ; after securing the family in a back room, they proceeded to rifle the drawers, and took away four Guinea Notes and some provisions. They did not demand any fire-arms. A person of the name of Patrick Doring, alias Dr. Bell, of Scholes, near Holmfirth, was apprehended on Tuesday, and was the following day committed to York Castle on a charge of endeavoring to intimidate witnesses from appearing at York in evidence against the rioters at the ensuing Assizes. —A person of the name of Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a Corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local-Militia, has been apprehended, charged on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place.— This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes of which he is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to a mental infirmity under which he is said to labour when he has " put an enemy is his mouth to steal away his brains." The story in the London Papers about the apprehension of 50 men, &c. is an entire fabrication, though two Police officers have been in that neighbourhood in disguise for some time, and the Military, both horse and foot, are very active, and were on duty all Wednesday night.

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Tuesday 14 July 1812

[Previous story above syndicated with a different closing and reference to Barrowclough being taken to Manchester.]

A person of the name Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local Militia, has been apprehended, charged, on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place. This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes which is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to mental infirmity under which he is said to labour. On the arrival of Barrowclough at Manchester, where he was taken for examination, for the purpose of placing him at a distance from his connections, he informed the Magistrates that there were two depots of arms, accumulated the disturbers of the public peace, one of them in the neighbourhood of Holmfirth, and the other near Grange Moor. On this information, about 300 of the Scotch Greys were dispatched from Manchester, Wednesday, into the Riding, and all the force in Huddersfield, civil and military, was ordered to co operate with the Greys in the seizure of the concealed arms; but after spending the whole night in a fruitless search, they returned to their quarters without making any discovery whatever. Having stated these facts, it is scarcely necessary to add, that the rumoured apprehension of 50 conspirators and of important discoveries made the police officers, is a mere fabrication —Leeds Mercury.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 20 June 1812

THE MERCURY `[Editorial commenting on the announcement on June 16, 1812 that the Orders in Council, which called for a blockade of French trade with Britain, France's allies, or neutral countries, including the Americans, would be suspended. ]`


... There is one observation stated in the reports of Mr Rose's speech, which will astonish every man acquainted with the present situation of the Staple Manufacturer of this Country; that Gentleman is stated to have said, that " there was no evidence of distress in the West Riding of Yorkshire." No evidence of distress in the West-Riding ! The man that could make such an assertion, could not have read or heard the evidence given by Mr. George Rawson, Mr. William Thompson, Mr. Joseph Walker, Mr. Christopher Lawson, or Mr. John Oxley, and a number of other witnesses ! We do intreat our readers to peruse with attention the evidence of those gentlemen, than whom there is not amongst us more respectable and intelligent men, and then to say how far Mr. Rose is justified in the assertion that there is no evidence of distress in the West Riding of Yorkshire. And if that evidence of distress does not satisfy him, we beg to remind him, that in visits lately made through the town of Leeds, by persons whose duty it was to inquire diligently into the situation of the poor, out of a population of about 9000 families, of which this town consists, there were found 3500 families that stood in need of the contributions of the benevolent, and that of those 3500 families, the average sum that each individual had to subsist upon, did not exceed 2s. 10d. a head, and at a time too when flour is from 5s. to 6s. a stone, and in a place too where the poor are in a better situation than perhaps any other manufacturing town in the county. Is not this some evidence that there is distress in the West Riding.

LEEDS, SATURDAY, JUNE 20

...

Last Sunday morning, at half past four o'clock, the Woollen Mill, called Gibraltar Mill, the property of Messrs. Thackray and Carlisle, situated near Pudsey, was discovered to be on fire, and so rapid was the progress of the flames as to reduce the building to a mere shell in less than an hour. By this casualty about 80 work-people are thrown out of employment, and ten Stocks, nine Billies, nine Carding Machines, and eleven Slubbing Machines, besides a quantity of other machinery, and the wood-work of the Steam Engine, are totally destroyed, together with about 60 Pieces of Woollens, and Wool for about 150 Cloths, involving a loss at from 6 to 7000*l*. Of this amount 5000*l* was insured in the Sun Fire Office. For some time a report prevailed that this Mill, which was one of the most complete buildings of the kind in the West Riding of York, had been fired by the hand of an incendiary, and was connected in some way with the depredations that have of late so unhappily prevailed in the manufacturing parts of the country; but this rumour, we are happy to find from enquiry on the spot, rests on no authority whatever, On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that the fire originated in a quantity of wool prepared a with fish oil, having been placed in the N. E. corner of the building, and suffered to remain accumulated till it burst out into a flame, and involved the whole premises in destruction.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 27 June 1812

Our Huddersfield Correspondent under the date of the 25th instant says:—

" Last Monday about midnight, a great number of armed men, with their faces disfigured by broad black marks down each cheek and over the forehead, assembled near the dwelling-house of Mr. Fisher, a shop-keeper, at Briestwistle, in this neighbourhood, and after firing two guns or pistols, demanded admittance into Mr. Fisher's house, which he refused. They then broke open the door, and wo of them rushing into the house, seized Mr. Fisher, who had just got out of bed ; they each presented a pistol to his breast, and threatened him with instant death if he stirred a foot. Not intimidated by this threat, Mr. Fisher rushed from them towards the door, when he was seized by other six men, who placing a sheet over his head, face and arms, kept him in that situation while their comrades ransacked the house, and took from his pocket-book bills to the amount of the 116*l.* besides 21l. in notes and some cash; they also took a quantity of notes and cash out of a drawer, but to what amount Mr. Fisher does not exactly know. When the depredation was completed, the Leader cried out to the guard placed over Mr. Fisher, "Let him go ; don't hurt him ; we have got what we wanted, and we will bring it back in three months," and immediately made off.

A man of the name of James Oldroyd, was apprehended at Dewsbury, on Tuesday evening last, by a troop of the Queen's Bays, sent from hence for that purpose, on suspicion of having been concerned in the attack on Mr. Cartwright's Mill at Rawfolds. He underwent an examination  yesterday morning, at Mills-Bridge *(sic)*, before Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. when he was committed to York-Castle to take his trial at the ensuing Assizes.

HOUSE OF COMMONS.-Wednesday, July 8.  
SECRET COMMITTEE.  

Mr. Leicester brought up the Report of the Secret Committee appointed to examine the sealed Packet of Papers laid before the House by order of the Prince Regent. The Report was then read at the Table. It stated that alarming disturbances, destructive to property, prevailed in the counties of Lancaster, York, &c. and had continued from the month of March down to the latest accounts on the 23d of June. That the riotors assembled in the night-time, with their faces blackened, armed with the implements of their trades, and other offensive instruments, with which they destroyed the property of those who were obnoxious to them. That they had in many instances written threatening letters—had proceeded the length of setting fire to the houses of individuals, and even that an atrocious murder had been committed on a person of the name of Horsfall, by four persons, who there was every reason to believe were accomplices in these disturbances. That great dread and alarm was occasioned in consequence of these proceedings ; and that in some instances sums of money were demanded and extorted. The Committee, without entering into details, thought it necessary to state that the first object of these Rioters seemed to be the breaking of machinery ; but they had in many instances resorted to measures infinitely more alarming, namely, the demanding of arms ; and had even carried them off, in many instances where they allowed every other species of property to remain untouched. These seemed not to be the effect of any sudden impulse, but of an organized system of lawless violence. Sometimes the Rioters were under the control of Leaders; and were distinguished not by names but by numbers ; were known to each other by signs and countersigns ; and carried on all with the utmost caution. They also took an oath, that while they existed under the canopy of Heaven they would not reveal any thing connected with the present disturbances, under the penalty of being put out of existence by the first brother whom they should meet, &c. It did not appear to the Committee that any sums of money were distributed'among the rioters. It was extremely difficult to discover them. It was held out to them that they might expect to be joined by other discontented persons from London, and that there were persons in the higher ranks who would also lend them support; but of these insinuations the Committee were not able to find evidence. They had adopted and submitted to a military discipline; they had regular muster-rolls. They used rockets and blue lights for communication with each other. They had also their Committees and Sub-Committees, and Secret Committees, and had their regular signs and counter-signs, by which they made their written communications; not, however, through the ordinary channel of the Post-office. It further appeared, that two-pence a week was appointed to be paid by each member to their respective Delegates; but that, in many instances, it had been found difficult to collect this weekly tax. In consequence of which some disturbances had taken place amongst themselves. Whatever was their object, however, and whoever were the secret movers of these disturbances, yet the secrecy with which they were carried on, the attempts at assassination that had been made, the oaths that had been administered, and the system of terror that prevailed, had not failed to impress the Committee deeply.

On the motion that the Report do lie on the table, Mr. Ponsonby wished to know if the Right. Hon. Gent. opposite intended to move that the Report be printed and taken into consideration? ...

Yorkshire Summer Assizes

The Judge's Address to the Grand Jury

Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,

MANY of you have so repeatedly served this office, and are so well acquainted with your duty, that were it not for a few peculiar cases, I should not have thought it necessary to trouble you with any observations upon the calendar. ...  No. 19, in the calendar, (James Haigh) is the case of a person committed on strong suspicion of being concerned in an attack upon a mill. On this I would remark, that if the evidence amounts only to what may be called conjecture, or slight presumption, it would be advise-able to throw out the bill; but it often happens that more evidence is laid before you, than contained the depositions handed to me. You will consider the amount of the evidence, and if it be but light, it would be better to reject the bill, unless you have reason to believe that you have all the evidence before you that can be collected on the case, because if you find the bill, and the party tried and acquitted upon it, he can never be tried for that offence again, whatever evidence may come out; but if the bill is thrown out, he would be still amenable to the law, if subsequent evidence should render it expedient to apprehend him. I make these observations, because it appears from the depositions, that some persons refused to enter into recognisance to appear and give their evidence. It gives ma concern to observe a disposition in any persons to obstruct the course of justice; and the magistrates would have been justified, and I wish they had acted, in committing the persons, thus refusing, to prison.

... In No. 25, (James Oldroyd,) the evidence will probably mainly rest on the confession of the party; you will, therefore, inquire what corroborating circumstances there may be in the case, and whether the confession rests under the suspicion of being made by the undue influence of promises or threats. ...

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 July 1812

YORKSHIRE SUMMER ASSIZES

The Assizes were opened at York, on Saturday last, by Baron Wood and Mr. Justice Bayley, the latter of whom presides at the Crown end.

...

Wednesday July 22.-JAMES OLDROYD was charged with assembling, with divers other persons on the night of the 11th April, and there making an attack on the Mill of Mr. Cartwright, of Rawfolds, and with beginning to demolish the same.

This Prosecution was founded on an Act passed in the 9th of Geo. III. which makes it a capital felony for any person riotously to assemble and demolish any Mill, or to begin to demolish any Mill.

Mr. Park, Mr.Topping, and Mr. Richardson, were Counsel for the Prosecutor, and Mr. Raine for the Defendant.

Mr. Park stated the case to the Jury, in which he laid it down as the law of the case, that the violent breaking of windows, when evidently done with such instruments, and under such circumstances as shows the intent to be to demolish the building, is such a beginning to demolish as comes within the meaning of the Act. And that every person so present with the rioters giving them his countenance and aid, is as guilty in law though no individual act of violence can be personally proved against him.

[We shall, conformable to our usual custom, state the case from the evidence of the Witnesses.]

Mr Cartwright, the proprietor of the Mill, was called for the purpose of proving the riot and the nature of the attack upon the Mill. A circumstantial narrative of this having already appeared before the public, it may be sufficient merely here to add, that the attack was made about 20 minutes after 12 o'clock at night on the 11th April, by a considerable number of persons, but how many the darkness of the night did not give him the means of forming an opinion, the attack was made by fire-arms, hammers, mauls, and hatchets; all the windows on the side of the attack were broken almost instantaneously, the lower windows by the instruments mentioned, and the upper stories by discharges of ball and slugs. The firing continued incessantly for about 20 minutes, it was accompanied by cries of "*bang up— damn you are you in*—*in with you*—*kill them every one*." The party in the inside, of which the witness was one, repelled the charge by keeping up a constant fire on the assailants, but the darkness of the night was such that the only guide they had in directing their fire was the flash from the  discharge of the fire-arms of the assailants. Witness supposes about 120 shots were discharged from the building, and about the same number from without. The attack continued about 20 minutes, when the assailants retired. As soon as the Witness thought it prudent to open the door, he found that two wounded men had been left behind, (who afterwards died) and near the premises, in the direction in which the party had returned, a number of mauls, hatchets, picklocks, masks, and bullet moulds, were found, and which were produced in court. The wood work of the door, which was partially lined with iron, was entirely destroyed. The Witness said, he had no means of forming judgement whether the Prisoner was there or not, but he had no reasons to believe he was there. The Prisoner was a person of good character, and had no grounds for animosity against him.

Mr. Cartledge, of Brow-bridge, near Elland, said, he was returning from Wakefield, on the 22d June, accompanied by Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Woodhead, they called at the Black Bull, at Mirfield, for refreshment, and sat in the Bar, it was about eight o'clock in the evening, the room was separated from another room by a thin wood partition, in which there was a small window, the glass of which was partly broken, heard a person say in a loud tone of voice, " I was at Rawfolds on the night of the attack, I was engaged there, I was close by the two men that fell," the same voice said, that he never was in any association but one, and that was Ned or General Ludd's, (believes he used both expressions) had been in his service three years, that he had been faithful to him and would ever remain so. Witness said he spoke in a loud and boisterous tone of voice. Mr. Ashworth, one of the party, went for a Constable, and the Witness went into the Room and enquired which of the party had used that language. There were eight or ten persons in the room, he was pointed out to him by William Clarkson, and on the return of Mr. Ashworth, they prevailed on him to go with them into another room, where he denied having used the words imputed to him.— On his cross-examination he said the man appeared to have had liquor, but was not drunk and appeared to understand what he said and what was said to him; he said Mr. Cartwright knew him, and if they disputed his character he would get a letter of recommendation from him. Witness first heard of Gen. Ludd about a year ago. Witness said the Prisoner spoke so loud that he might have been heard by every person in the low part of the house.

Mr. Ashworth stated the conversation at the Black Bull in these terms :-I heard a voice say, as if in answer to some person who had been contradicting him " but I was at Rawfolds Mill that night, and I *was* engaged in the attack, and I saw the man fell," or the men. Witness believes both expressions were used at different times. The same voice further said, "I was never engaged in any association or society in my life but that of General or Ned Ludd, I have ever been true to it and I have been in it three years." Witness said these words were not used uninterruptedly as he had stated them, it was an interrupted conversation, and many of the expressions were repeated several times. After a consultation as to the course which it became their characters to pursue, it was determined to send for a Constable, and Witness went for one, but did not succeed; on his return, the Prisoner was pointed out to him, and when he spoke he recognised the same voice, but lower and softened. Witness proceeded to state what he heard of the conversation in the room to which they retired, which was the same in substance as stated by Mr. Cartledge; the Prisoner denied having used the expressions imputed to him; the Witness said he had no reason to believe that the Prisoner did not understand what he did or said; his spirits appeared to be elevated by the liquor he had taken. Nothing material occurred in has cross-examination, except that the Witness judging from the boisterous tone and manner in which the words were used, should have thought them the words of a crazy person.

Wm. Clarkson (the person referred to by Mr. Cartledge) stated that he was in the Black Bull public house on the night in question, and heard the conversation, heard the prisoner say he was at Rawfolds Mill the night it was attacked, that he was engaged in the attack, and that he was near to his fellow creatures when they fell; he never had entered into any society, but he would abide by it as long as he lived, Witness said he considered the Prisoner as drunk from first to last.

Joseph Senior was also present, heard part of the conversation, but did not much attend to it. Remembers the Prisoner saying he was at Rawfolds Mill the night it was attacked, and was engaged in the attack; did not hear him say any thing more; was not in the room when the conversation was begun, but the Prisoner and another person appeared to be talking one against the other. The Prisoner appeared to have two partners, (that is persons who were drinking with him) and one of them said to him, "hold thy peace, *if there be a good trade and meal come down, Ned Ludd will die*."-(A laugh.)

This finished the case on the part of the Prosecution.

Mr. Joseph Savage stated that he was a surgeon at Dewsbury, and attended the Prisoner, who was very subject to attacks of fever; he attended him up to the time of Pontefract Sessions, but was then under the necessity of being absent from the 6th to the 11th of April; left him medicines; he was in a debilitated state, and not able to endure much fatigue. Judging from what he saw of the Prisoner, it would have been dangerous for him to have been out on the night of the 11th of April. Witness saw him on the morning of the 12th, and, from his appearance, he should have supposed he had had his usual rest the preceding night.

Mary Ward sleeps in the house of the Prisoner, who is married, and has two children. She went to bed at ten o'clock on the 11th of April, at which time the prisoner was in bed. He sleeps in the room they usually live in. Her child being unwell and restless, she got up again about eleven o'clock, and came down stairs to the fire; the Prisoner was still in bed, and spoke to her, and complained that he could get no rest.—Witness soon after went to bed again, but her child continuing restless, she was under the necessity of getting up again. The clock then struck one. She remained up until near three o'clock, during which time the Prisoner frequently spoke to her, and, at the request of his wife, she gave him his medicine. The child being quiet, Prisoner advised her to go to bed, asking her what o'clock it was; she looked at the clock, and said it wanted a few minutes to three.— Witness got up at six o'clock in the morning, and went to her father's house; Prisoner was still in bed.

The Counsel for the Prosecution cross-examined her at considerable lengths, but she did not vary her testimony. She accounted for sleeping at the Prisoner's, by stating that her father had six children, and only two beds, and had not room for her and her child to sleep.

His Lordship summoned up the evidence with great particularity, and observed that the riot and the beginning to demolish the mill had been clearly proved, but the material question remained, which was, whether the Prisoner was present at the attack. If he was present he was guilty. That he was present there was the evidence of his own declaration. The Jury would consider, whether under all the circumstances of the case they could be fully convinced that these declarations were founded in truth ; they would examine the manner and the circumstances under which they were made ; and from a careful consideration of them, determine the degree of credit to which they were intitled. But it was right to state that these declarations, though fully proved, were not confirmed by any corroborating circumstances. On the part of the defence, there was the evidence of Mr. Savage, who appeared to be a respectable man, and the amount of whose testimony might fairly be stated as rendering it improbable that the Prisoner should be there. If the evidence of Mary Ward had full credit given to it, and there was nothing improbable or inconsistent in the account she gave, and her evidence had not been shaken by the cross-examination. If her testimony was believed, they must of necessity acquit the prisoner, as it was impossible he could have been there. The Jury would weigh all the circumstances of the case, and if upon the whole, they were convinced that the Prisoner's declaration at the public-house was true, they would find him guilty ; but if they believed it was not true, or had a reasonable doubt upon the subject, they would acquit him.

The Jury, without leaving the box, found the prisoner-NOT GUILTY.

The verdict was received in perfect silence.

It may be proper here to add, that the most perfect order and decorum prevailed in the Court during the whole of the trials for rioting; and there is in the city no military parade, nor anything to indicate that the County is not in a state of the most profound tranquility and security.
 
ARMS STEALING

Thursday, July 23.—WILLIAM SYKES was charged with stealing a gun, in the dwelling-house of John Marsh, of Meltham, on the night of the 9th of May.

The Counsel for the Crown called William Wady, a private in the West Kent Militia, to prove a conversation in which the prisoner admitted that he was free, able and willing to serve General Ludd. But the Learned Judge said, he could not admit such irrelevant matter to be given in evidence.

James Kershaw knows the prisoner; saw him on the night of Saturday, the 9th of May, about eleven o'clock—he had a gun in his hand, and his face blacked. Prisoner said to him, "Well my lad, will you go with me a little journey ?" Witness said, "No " But he followed him at a short distance, to see what he was about. He went to the house of John Marsh, of Meltham, about a quarter of a mile, and having roused them by knocking at the door, said, "I am informed you have a gun here; General Ludd has sent me for it, and if you do not deliver it up I will blow the door open." Witness heard the gun fired. The Prisoner was much intoxicated, and staggered in his walk.

Thomas Whiteley stated, that the Prisoner made the same proposal to him as to the last Witness, and said he was going to get John Marsh and Jonas Beardesley's guns. Witness went about forty yards with him, and turned back on the Prisoner, saying, "Ludders never speak." Witness in a short time heard the report of a gun, which appeared to be in the direction of Mr. Marsh's house. Witness did not observe that the Prisoner was intoxicated; did not think he was.

John Creaser, apprentice to Mr. Marsh, stated, that he was awaked by the report of a gun; he got up, and having received the gun which his master had given to him from the lodger, he delivered it to the person at the door. Being asked the reason of his readily giving it up, he said, there were so many reports about the Luddites, and he had been informed that they would not be denied. The firing of the gun had also made him afraid. When he delivered the gun, he said, "It has so lock;" on which the person at the door said, " It is well; it shall be well repaired, and, brought back in open day." Witness said the gun was brought back on the Monday following, but it was not repaired.

Mr. John Marsh, the master of the house, stated more precisely the terms in which the gun was demanded. After he had answered to the knocking at the doer, a person from without said, "We are informed you have a gun, and we are come for it."— Witness told them (for he supposed there were a number, though he only heard one voice) he had not a gun, and called to his apprentice not to give it up; but he supposes the boy did not hear him, as he gave them the gun. The gun was brought back on Monday night, by Joseph Whiteley. During the time the person was at the door, he heard him call out two numbers, as if calling to somebody, but the witness only heard the voice of one person.

Philip Earnshaw lent the prisoner a gun belonging to his master, on the night in question; he told him it was for a bit of fun, and wished the Witness to go with him. Witness went a short distance with him, but he left him, because he had some mischief in his head, he laughed so. Witness then went to the Prisoner's house, who returned in about half an hour, and brought back another gun with him. Witness did not examine the gun of his master, to see whether it had been recently discharged.

Joseph Whiteley stated, that he carried the gun back to Mr. Marsh, on Monday, the 11th of May.

This finished the case on the part of the Prosecution.

His Lordship said, he thought it unnecessary to call upon the Prisoner for his defence. There did not appear to have been any design to steal the gun — no bad use had been made of it— and it was returned to its owner before any search had been made for arms in the house of the Prisoner. It appeared to have been an idle, but most dangerous frolic, and for which he had been deservedly imprisoned. The Jury concurring in this opinion, found the Prisoner— *Not Guilty*.

...

James Haigh, of Dalton, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Joseph Arden and others, with being strongly suspected of having been one of the persons who riotously assembled and attacked the mill of Mr. William Cartwright, of Liversedge.-No Bill.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 July 1812

The persons called Luddites it is said, may be divided into three classes— *Robbers*, men who wish to live by plunder, and avail themselves of the disturbed state of the country to carry on their villainous purposes. *Anti-Machinists*, persons who impute a difficiency of labour to the use of Machinery in shearing cloth, weaving cotton, and weaving hosiery ; and *Spies*, men that have introduced themselves amongst the depredators to worm out information, and whose employment must cease with the disturbances. We should be glad to know to which of these classes the persons at present engaged in stealing arms belong; we have our suspicions; and cannot forget, that a man of the name of Watt, a spy, was executed at Edinburgh, about the year 1794, for an act of High Treason in which he had engaged while labouring in his vocation, in order to draw others into his snares. The history of this man is curious, and we will take an early opportunity of recalling it to public recollection.

THE MURDERERS OF MR. HORSFALL.  
We copy the following curious article from the Courier of Thursday the 29 ult. :-  
To the Editor of the Courier. Huddersfield, Oct. 24.

Sir.- A very important event happened here on Thursday last, of which as the Leeds Mercury of today does not appear to have had any information, I hasten to communicate the intelligence through the medium of your paper.

A man'has been taken up and examined before that indefatigable Magistrate Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. and has at length received the offer of his Majesty's pardon, and given the most complete and satisfactory evidence of the horrible murder of Mr. W. Horsfall. In consequence of this, the whole of the wretches concerned in that dreadful transaction, have been taken and committed to York Castle, to take their trial at the ensuing Commission of Assize. — He was with the party (four in number) when Mr. Horsfall was shot.

They were furnished with loaded pistols by ——— who ordered them to take their stand in the Plantation on Crossland Moor. Two others soon after joined them, and took their station about twenty yards before then. When the unfortunate Gentleman came up, two fired. They then all fled across the fields, and ——— damned them all the way for not firing their pieces. Two ran forwards to Honley, four miles off, and two more stopped at a place called Dungeon Wood, and hid their pistols at ————'s house there, in some flocks— left their great coats, and ran immediately in their jackets to Huddersfield, where the news of the murder had but just arrived. The next morning they all four met at the work-shop of their employer (a cropper) and ———— produced a Bible. and made them all swear not to betray each other.

These villains have frequently been examined before, but have always been discharged for want of sufficient evidence. One behaved with the greatest effrontery till he saw ———, and then he changed colour and gasped for breath. When he came out, he said "Dam that ————, he has done me."

It appears ——— and ———— have been Chiefs in all the disgraceful transactions that have occurred in this part of the country the last twelve months, especially at Rawfolds, where the former was captain of the gun-division, and the latter of the pistol. ————— has thus made discoveries which will lead to the detection of a great number of these offenders, and, it is hoped, ultimately restore the West-Riding to its former tranquility.

TRIALS FOR TREASON.

FIRST DAY.— MONDAY, JUNE 9.

This day was fixed for the Trials of the State Prisoners confined in the Tower.

Last night the Guards were doubled at the Tower, and this morning orders were issued to prevent all strangers from entering the interior of the place. In consequence of this, the Yeomen of the Guard who were posted at the gate of the entrance leading to the bloody Tower, prevented all strangers from going that way.

At about 20 minutes after eight o'clock, Watson, Hooper, Preston, and Thistlewood, were brought from the Tower to Westminster Hall, in four glass coaches. In each coach were four Yeomen of the Guard, and one prisoner ; and the whole procession was escorted by two troops of Life Guards. They passed over London Bridge. When they arrived in Palace-yard, the prisoners got out of their respective coaches, in the order in which we have mentioned their names, and were conducted, each between two Yeomen of the Guard, through a lane of Constables, to the wicket at the great entrance into the Hall.

On the gates of the Hall being opened, at a quarter after eight, it was discovered that a large and strong railing had been thrown across the hall from the Treasury steps, to prevent the pressure of the crowd and the interruption of the Law Officers in their passage to the Court.

At half-past eight o'clock, there was a tremendous crush at the doors of the Court, which was immediately followed by a grand entry of Barristers, who took their seats at the back part, reserving two clear benches for the Counsel on the part of the Crown and the prisoners.

At 20 minutes to nine o'clock, Mr. Watson was ushered into Court by a party of Yeomen of the Guard. He was dressed in a suit of black, and carried under his right arm a book; he bowed respectfully to the Court, and took his seat immediately behind the bar.

The Captain of the Yeomen or Gentleman Jailor, and the Lieutenant of the Tower, took their seats to the left of Watson. Preston was next ushered into Court, attended by another party of Yeomen of the Guard, he was also dressed in black; he appeared cheerful, and cordially shook hands with Watson: a party of Yeomen also escorted him. Hooper next made his appearance, and was dressed in black; he also shook hands with Watson and the rest. Thistlewood came in last; he looked ill: was dressed in a sailor's jacket and trowsers, and wore a black handkerchief. He manifested great anxiety to speak to Watson, and on his approach to him shook him heartily by the hand.—Sixteen Yeomen of the Guard sat by the side and behind the prisoners.

Before the proceedings commenced, the prisoners frequently conversed together. The Attorney-General elected to try the prisoners separately, and to take the case of Watson first.

A great number of Jurors were challenged both by the Counsel for the Crown, and also by the Counsel for the prisoner.

The following Gentlemen were then sworn of the Jury.

Thomas Allmack, Conduit street, bookseller.  
Robert Nocton, Temple-bar, button-maker.  
John Tomlinson, Covent.Garden, woollen-draper.  
P. Richardson. Charing-Cross, Lottery-office Keeper  
John Briant, Wapping-street, Anchor-smith.  
Samuel Kell. Red-Lion street, Holborn, carpenter.  
Richard Ramsden, Holborn, Capilaire-maker.  
William Phillips, Holborn, iron-monger.  
T. W. Barker, Hatton-garden, silversmith.  
Richard Perkins, Holborn, shoe-maker.  
William Hatblock, Shoreditch, currier.  
Samuel Knight, Norton-Falgate, druggist.

Proclamation was made in the usual way, as soon as the Jury was sworn, and then Mr. Barlow, the Officer of the Court, proceeded to read the Indictment Bill. After the-first count thereof was read,

Lord Ellenborough interposed and observed, that as all the other counts had annexed to them the same series of Overt Acts, he supposed that it would not be required by either party to have the whole of these repeatedly read over.

Mr. Wetherell, on the part of the prisoners, said, it could not be the wish of the Gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Copley) to cause the least unnecessary trouble or delay, but on the contrary their wish was to prevent both. The officer of the Court then by the consent of all sides, only recited the general counts, four in number, of the indictment, without repeating the overt acts.

Mr. Shepherd, the junior Counsel for the prosecution, then opened the pleadings ; but signified, that after the time that was occupied in reading over the particulars of the charge, he would refrain from repeating it.

The Attorney-General then rose, and in a very long speech set forth the charges against the prisoners.- After he had concluded his speech on Monday, and evidence had been gone into, the Court ordered no part of the proceedings to be published during the trial.

SECOND DAY.

The prisoners were brought into Court with the same ceremony and solemnity as yesterday, and the Judges took their seats on the Bench precisely at nine o'clock. The first witness called, was

*Charles Shearman, Jun.* who was examined by the Solicitor-General. He deposed to the events in Spa-Fields, to the flag placed in the waggon, and to the speeches from that vehicle. On his cross-examination, he said, that he was twelve yards from the waggon, and heard no other part of the speech of a young man, but his invitation to jump down. To a question from the Court, he said, that only one person spoke while he was in the field, and he could not tell whether more than one individual jumped down, general as might be the invitation.

*Mr. Johne Stafford*, chief clerk at Bow-street, said, that on the 2d of December there was a great concourse of people at Spa-Fields; Mr. Hunt and others addressed the populace. He saw a flag displayed of three colours; green, white, and red. Inscribed upon it was, Nature, Justice, Truth, and some other words. A great many Police Officers were in attendance.

Lord Ellenborough observed, that it might be as well here to produce the flag itself, and the flag was accordingly exhibited by Mr. Hobler, Clerk of the Mayor's Court.

The witness resumed, after some further trifling particulars, that he saw all the people in the waggon in the act of jumping down. He endeavoured to break the pole to which one of the flags was attached, but was unable to do so ; yet, he got the flag under his feet, when Limerick, the officer, assisted him. On his cross-examination, he deposed that all the assistants of the police officers were in attendance. He saw no soldiers in the field, nor did he know that any soldiers were in the vicinity.

*Limerick* was next examined to nearly the same particulars.

*Mr. Platt* proved the discharging a pistol at him in Mr. Beckwith's shop, under the circumstances already before the public, and during his examination it was attempted to be shown that the pistol went off while the witness was wrestling with the person by whom was supposed to be discharged.

*Sir J. Shaw* spoke to the seizure of the colours, &c. at the Royal Exchange. He thought it a very contemptible riot, which might easily have been suppressed.

*Mr. Hall*, the High Sheriff of the county of Middlesex, detailed what had occurred in the Minories. He only saw about 19 men with arms, and they were rather wantonly than viciously using them. He thought that about 20 soldiers might have put an end to the whole disturbance. He applied to the Tower for assistance, but in vain.

Several other witnesses spoke to the same effect. Some important papers taken upon the person of Watson, were rejected from the want of proper identification.

THIRD DAY.

This morning, the State prisoners arrived at Westminster at about a quarter past eight, and having been brought into Court, Watson was placed as usual in the front, and the others immediately behind him; they shook hands together, and appeared to be provided with refreshments, and were in high spirits; they were attended by sixteen Yeomen of the Guard. At half past eight, Mr. Justice Bailey took his seat on the Bench, for the purpose of disposing of several common motions, and at nine o'clock the Chief Justice and the other Judges entered the Court. At the same time the Attorney-General, Mr. Topping, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Richardson, and Mr. Shepherd, for the prosecution, came in; and when Mr. Wetherell, and Mr. Serjeant Copley, had taken their seats, the trial proceeded.

*Charles Mills*, of Terne's-court, Somers-Town, a patrole of Bow-street, was examined by the Solicitor General.

*John Castle* was afterwards examined, and his examination occupied the whole of the day.

At seven o'clock Lord Ellenborough asked the Counsel for the prisoners, whether they meant to proceed in the cross-examination, as the examination in chief was finished.

Mr. Wetherell said he was impressed with the necessity of asking the witness a few questions, at the same time that he felt the fatigue under which the Court and Jury must suffer, if he proceeded at length into the cross-examination of the witness. After so long examination as had already taken place, it could not be supposed that his examination of Castle could be short, he would proceed to the usual hour at which the Court adjourned, and resume in the morning.

The Attorney General objected to any suspension of the cross-examination. It was open to the Counsel for the prisoner either to proceed now or to-morrow.

Lord Ellenborough said, that the Court were prepared to hear him go on ; but at the same time they were ready to accommodate the Counsel for the prisoner.

Mr. Wetherell submitted to the Court, that in a case so infinitely important they would direct that the witness Castle, who appeared, on the return of the list of witnesses to be in custody, should not be permitted to have communication directly or indirectly, with any person, previous to his cross-examination.

Lord Ellenborough did not see how the Court, with regard to precedent, could make such an order; but he thought Mr. Wetherell could best rely on the assurance of the Attorney-General.

The Attorney-General said, he was sure the Court would agree with him in thinking, that Mr Wetherell had asked no more than was right ; and after hearing their Lordships' opinion, he felt it his duty to give a positive order, that the witness, Castle, shall not on any pretence have any communication whatever on the subject of the trial, till after his cross-examination.

After this, it was settled that the cross-examination should take place at the opening of the Court to morrow, and Mr. Wetherell said, he was afraid it would occupy a considerable time.

In the afternoon, while Mr. Gurney was examining Castle, Mr. Stafford brought into Court a considerable number of pieces of paper, with the following and various other inscriptions on them, "*Britons arise! No poverty in a plentiful Country.
!*" which he stated were circulating in great numbers throughout the Hall. They were immediately handed to the Attorney-General, who rose and addressed the Court immediately: " He should at all times be extremely sorry to interrupt the proceedings of the Court, but more particularly upon an important occasion, like the present; but seeing the Sheriff in Court, he hoped that Gentleman would excuse the liberty he took in suggesting that more than ordinary caution ought to be exerted in the Hall, to prevent the infraction of the public peace, when papers of the very dangerous tendency of those produced were in circulation.

On the swearing of the officers to keep the Jury from any communication, one of them observed, that if detained in the Court all day, and in seclusion all the evening, he feared the proceedings would be still further deferred by some of them being at length obliged to require medical assistance.

The Court felt their situation, and would endeavour to afford every convenience compatible with duty. It was better not to say more in Court. The officer attendant on the Jury was ordered to attend their Lordships in their Chamber.

The Sheriff now quitted the Court, and the proceedings of the day finished without any interruption.

The Tower yesterday received an additional reinforcement of 200 men from the brigade of guards. The whole are placed under the command of Lieut. Col. Cochrane,of the 3d guards.

The prisoners, on their return from the Court, the moment they entered the Hall, were received with loud huzzas from the surrounding multitude, which were repeated in Palace-yard, and continued to Westminster-bridge.

FOURTH DAY.

After Mr. Justice Holroyd had disposed of a great many common motions, the other Judges took their seats on the Bench, and at half-past nine Mr. Wetherell commenced his cross-examination of Cassels who was brought up in custody. His first interrogatories to this witness were to ascertain whether he had had any communication with any person, or person's, directly or indirectly, by writing, printing, or otherwise, upon the subject of his testimony yesterday: all of which interrogatories he answered in the negative.

The orders for the exclusion of strangers at the Tower during the time that the State Prisoners are there, continue to be enforced, and no person who is not well known is permitted to enter the interior of the garrison.

Several Members of Parliament, Sir Robert Wilson, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Hunt, &c. were in Court.

Every thing remained in perfect quietness in and about the Hall, and this day's proceedings finished at six o'clock. The prisoners were cheered on going back to the Tower.

THE MERCURY

The result of the trials for High Treason will do more towards removing discontent, allaying irritation, and tranquillising the public mind, than all the unconstitutional and coercive measures recommended by the present advisers of the Crown, or we should rather say, that this result will materially counteract the pernicious effects which these measures have a tendency to produce. The acquittal of obscure and unprotected men, against whom all the power of the Crown was arrayed, will afford a practical proof that there still exists in our Constitution a real barrier against oppression, which cannot be passed by the most despotic ministers. A proof, the cogency of which, the most ignorant and illiterate will be able fully to appreciate. It evinces that the trial by jury, which forms an integral part in the British Constitution, has not been deteriorated by those influences, which have, so essentially impaired the representative part of the system. We also rejoice in the acquittal of the state prisoners on another ground, because this solemn verdict of the jury will deter Ministers from instituting prosecutions for high treason on light and insufficient grounds, on the credit of such witnesses as CASTLE, or on the information of such incendiaries as OLIVER. It was the acquittal of Mr. HARDy, HORNE TOOKE, and their associates, in the year 1794, which preserved at that awful period, the ark of the Constitution from perishing on the rocks of anarchy, or of being swallowed up in the abyss of despotism. It was a period full of cruel inquietude and alarm, the liberties and lives of the people seemed in imminent danger of being sacrificed at the caprice of an overbearing administration, when the firm and upright conduct of a jury, presented its impenetrable shield between the accused and the accusers; though the indictment had in effect been found by both Houses of Parliament, and though every means possessed by the Crown, had been resorted to, to insure their conviction. The decision of the jury in the case to which we refer, operated almost like a charm; its effect was instantaneous; it at once restored confidence to the people, checked the vindictive proceedings of the Ministers of the Crown, and prevented that fatal catastrophe, which at that period seemed inevitable,

IN the House of Lords on Monday, LORD LiVERPOOL, in answer to the inquiries of EARL GREY, distinctly admitted that Mr. OLIVER was an agent employed by Ministers, for the purpose of detecting conspiracies; but it is now evident, from numerous facts, that this spy, finding no materials for his occupation in any existing plots, actively engaged in the fabrication of them, and that on the most extensive scale. This diabolical plot against the lives and liberties of his Majesty's subjects has already been the subject of investigation by the Magistracy of this Riding, the proceedings and result of which is a flattering confirmation of the accuracy of the statement we presented to the public on this subject. We trust that it will also become the subject of Parliamentary inquiry: the honour and dignity of Parliament, the safety of the country, and the character of the Executive Government, are deeply implicated in probing this matter to the bottom. Ministers, if innocent of any participation in this plot, ought most zealously to aid this investigation. To oppose inquiry, will be to involve themselves in the foul suspicions; for should it appear that Ministers have, we do not say participated in the plot, (for that would be the blackest treason) but even by their negligence connived at it ;— if, on the first intimation of the misconduct of their agent, they did not instantly recall him, and if, on proof of his guilt, they persist in protecting him, it will be the duty of Parliament to address the PRINCE REGENT, to remove these ministers for ever from his councils. This, indeed, on other grounds, would be a consummation most devoutly to be wished. The Secret Committee of the House of Commons have not yet made their Report, and it is suggested in the *Times*, that an investigation into the case of OLIVER ought to precede the delivery of their report. OLIVER himself will, no doubt, be called before the Committee, who Will probably find it their duty to hand him over to that confinement in which he has been the means of involving so many innocent men.

WATSON'S TRAIL CONTINUED.

On Thursday, at half-past nine, the trial again re-commenced with the cross-examination of Castle, who was brought up in custody; the cross-examination continued till one o'clock, after which a number of witnesses were produced to speak to various circumstances ;  this occupied the Court till half-past six, when the prisoners were again re-conveyed to the Tower.

On Friday, the examination of witnesses for the Crown was resumed, which continued till half-past twelve, when the Attorney-General declared he had closed his case.— Mr. Wetherell then commenced stating the prisoner's case, and did not terminate his address, until six o'clock in the evening. The Learned Counsel's speech was full of legal argument, and displayed the strongest powers of reasoning. He contended that, if the case of the prisoner were made out, it came within the provisions of the law for tumultuary riots, and not within the statutes of treason. It was impossible, he said, to bring it within the latter, without breaking down those great boundaries which marked out the distinctive classification of criminal offence. He also took an historical review of the different riots which took place for the last century, the tumults in the reign of Queen Anne and George I. Lord George Gordon's riots in 1780, and others, down to the late period of the Corn Bill and said, that, if the law of treason could have been at all applied, the Attorney-Generals of these times would lave called it into operation. At great length he combated the principle of constructive and interpretative treason. —At six o'clock the evidence for the prisoner was about to be entered into, which the Court adjourned.

On Saturday, Mr. Wetherell proceeded to call witnesses upon the first head of the defence, namely, the incredibility of John Castle's evidence. Mr. Hunt, the Spa-Fields orator, and Mr. Bryant, a solicitor, were examined on this head. Evidence was then tendered to shew Castle had been guilty of crimes of which he had never been convicted, but the Judges decided it could not be received.— At one o'clock Mr. Wetherell finished the evidence for the prisoner, and after their Lordships had taken some coffee, and Mr. Serjeant Copley had taken some necessary refreshment, he rose and addressed the Jury on the evidence on both sides. At the close of his speech, the prisoner declining to offer any thing to the Court himself, the Solicitor-General was occupied several hours in replying on behalf of the Crown, and the Court then adjourned till Monday.

The Court was crowded on each day during the week with persons of distinction; outside Westminster Hall there were numbers of people, who huzzaed the Prisoners, on their arrival and departure each day.— The Jury, in compliance with a wish expressed to that effect, were allowed to communicate with their friends, and to walk out for the air attended by the Sheriff's officers, that no one might have intercourse with them.

SEVENTH DAY.

MONDAY, JUNE 16. ACQUITTAL OF WATSON.

At twenty minutes past ten o'clock Lord Ellenborough proceeded to sum up the evidence to the Jury. His Lordship commenced by reading the precise form of the indictment against the prisoner, and explaining the four parts of which it was composed. He also laid down the ]aw of treason, and explained the precise bearings of the Statute of the 25th of Edward III. and the parts of this Statute which were applicable to the present case, namely, the compassing and imagining the death of the King and levying war against his authority. He did this not in any language of his own, but, as he expressed it, in the words of Lord Hale, Mr. Justice Foster, and some of the most eminent and best legal authorities, who were known in our country. By these eminent characters it had been laid down, that tumults which had merely a private object were not within the Statute of treason; but that those of a broader complexion, the breaking down fences and enclosures, and offences of that character, were within the law. The Learned Judge agreed with the Counsel for the prisoner, that the main question for the Jury was, whether the offences charged upon the prisoner were of the character of irregular and unprepared violence, or of a preconcerted and systematic plan. This was the main issue. Here he would observe, upon a remark of the Counsel for the prisoner, on the subject of the Law Officers of the Crown not calling either Harrison or Keans— why, it was evident that these men, if called, may demur to any question relative to their participation in this plot, yet the Counsel for the prisoner might have called them if they pleased, to shew the innocency of these transactions ; for if they be innocent, then these witnesses would incur no responsibility, whereas, in the other vie, they must answer at their peril. The Learned Judge, with reference to the testimony of Castle, left it to the Jury to consider how far his testimony was confirmed by other evidence, and quoted the opinion of Lord Holt in favour of the admissibility of such testimony under certain circumstances.

The Learned Judge then read *seriatim* the whole of the evidence for the prosecution-becoming exhausted of towards three o'clock,

Mr. Justice Bayley continued to read the evidence to the Jury, and occasionally point out the parts in the detail in which the testimony of Castle was confirmed.

When the evidence was gone through—

Lord Ellenborough said he would only add a few observations to the Jury-great pains were taken (and praise-worthy ones for their client) by the Counsel for the prisoner, to nullify the testimony of Cassels.- The Crown were bound to furnish a list of witnesses to the prisoner, who was not bound to deliver the same list to the prosecutor; it might then possibly happen that if the Crown had the same opportunity of investigating the characters of those who exposed the immoral life of their witness, the same stigma might perhaps attach to those who made such a statement. It appeared, however, that the prisoner and his associates continued in intercourse with Cassels, from the 15th of November to the 2nd of December, notwithstanding his infamous toast at Hunt's, which ought to have at once compelled them to discard him for ever. But the important confirmatory parts for the Jury to consider were the taking Mr. Cosser's house, the pipe making by Bentley, and other matters of less, but not unimportant notice. The Learned Judge reverted at considerable length to the serious character of the evidence, and concluded by entreating that the Jury would give in such a verdict as would quiet their own consciences, protect the prisoner, and give him immunity from punishment if he deserved not to be visited by it ; while they would, at the same time, feel that they were protecting the laws of the land, and giving them, and those who administer them, effective security.

The Jury now proposed to withdraw, and an officer a (Mr. Beaumont) was sworn to take them in charge during their deliberation.

*Lord Ellenborough* then intimated to the Jury that they might have refreshment in the box before they retired; afterward, until their verdict was given in, or they could not expect to receive any.

*Mr. Justice Abbot* suggested to them to have some tea or coffee.

Some of the Jury wished for sandwiches and wine and water and in a few minutes after manifested an anxiety to retire and consider their verdict without waiting for refreshment.

*Lord Ellenborough* told them not to be in a hurry ; the Court would very readily wait. Officers soon after escorted them out of Court to their room. Most of the barristers in the front seats, after the retirement of the Jury, stood up, as did Mr. Watson, folding his arms. Afterwards, he wrote a note to Mr. Harmer, his solicitor, then conversed with Mr. Wetherell. who was on the floor of the Court, and received Mr. Harmer's answer.

The Officer, to whose care the Jury were committed, took the following oath:—

"You shall well and truly keep this Jury without meat, drink, or fire—you shall suffer no person whatever to speak to them, nor you yourself, unless it be to ask them whether they are agreed, or not."

Before the return of the Jury, great huzzaing and clapping of hands were heard in the Hall. Much surprise was apparent in Court. Lord Ellenborough said the Hall ought to be cleared, and Mr. Sheriff Kirby went out, as if for that purpose, but quiet was presently restored, and it was found, that the applause had been given to the Lord Mayor, on his passage through the Hall.

At 20 minutes before seven, having been out an hour and 49 minutes, they returned into Court, and their names being called over,

Mr. Stirling, Clerk of the Crown Office, put the question— Gentlemen of the Jury, by whom do you pronounce your verdict? By the mouth of your Foreman ?

The answer was given in the affirmative.

Mr. Stirling— Gentlemen, how say you? Is the Prisoner, James Watson, guilty or not guilty of the offence of High Treason with which he is charged?

Mr. Richardson- NOT GUILTY.

Mr. Stirling—You say he is Not Guilty; that is your verdict ; and so say you all. Gentlemen, how say you, is he guilty of flying from justice?

Mr Richardson— Not guilty, my Lord.

Mr. Stirling— You say the Prisoner is not guilty; this is your verdict; and so say you all.

A Barrister, drawing aside the green curtain, instantly called out towards the Hall —" Acquitted." He was heard only by a small part of the company, but their plaudits immediately made it known to the others, and were re-echoed from all parts of the Hall. The intelligence spread rapidly through Palace-yard and the adjoining streets. It was impossible to walk in the neighbourhood without hearing the words a hundred times in five minutes.

Lord Ellenborough looked round this Court, as if his Lordship, in the first moments of the impression made by the verdict, seemed to think the plaudits proceeded from a part of the audience there ; but his Lordship soon perceived that the utmost decorum prevailed within its doors.

As soon as silence was obtained, Mr. Watson asked permission to say a few words. One or two gentlemen near him intimated, that as his Counsel, Mr. Wetherall, had withdrawn, this might not be proper, but the Court appeared willing to hear him. Mr. Watson, bowing respectfully to the Jury, said, "Gentlemen, I thank you much."

*Lord Ellenborough* asked the Attorney-General if he had any other charge against the prisoner ? The Attorney-General answered, "No, my Lord."

Mr. Watson was then discharged; but, as the plaudits continued in the Hall, Lord Ellenborough expressed a wish that the Jury should wait a little time before they withdrew; and Mr. Watson, appearing to feel that the reason of the request might extend to him, also remained in Court. When he withdrew it was through the vaulted passage, which leads to Old Palace-yard, whence he passed with Mr. Harmer to Millbank.

In the mean time, the carriage, which had been drawn up near the door of the Hall to convey Mr. Watson back to the Tower, if that had been permitted by the verdict, was removed, and the Home Guards who attended it, retired.

In Spring Gardens Mr. Harmer and Mr. Watson were recognized and cheered.

COURT OF KING'S BENCH, TUESDAY.

Up to an advanced period of this morning it was supposed that the proceedings already instituted against the remaining State Prisoners would be carried on to trials, and a Jury were summoned yesterday, who remained in Court all this morning under that expectation.

At one o'clock Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper and Thomas Preston, were brought into Court, amidst the loudest acclamations, and placed at the bar, under the care of the Yeoman of the Guard, as usual. They were all dressed in black. At twenty minutes before one the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General had entered the Court, when the following Jury were impannelled—

John Franklin, John Hunter, John Kemp, Alex Chapp, George Barber, Charles Hewitt, John Rose, Robert Hartley, Joseph Smith, William Fell, William Gurdler Muthlow, and Wm. Cleghorn.

The Attorney-General then addressed the Court as follows :—

" May it please your Lordships,

" It becomes my duty to inform the Court, that it is not my intention to call any witnesses to support the charge against the prisoners."

Lord Ellenborough—" Gentlemen of the Jury— as no evidence is offered by his Majesty's Attorney-General against the prisoners, it becomes your duty to find them Not Guilty."

Clerk of the Court —" Gentlemen, are Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper, and Thomas Preston, found guilty of the Treason whereof they stand indicted, or not guilty ?"

Foreman of the Jury.-" Not Guilty."

Clerk of the Court.—" How say you, did they fly from justice?"

Foreman of the Jury.—" No."

Lord Ellenborough—" Mr. Attorney General, have you any further charge against the prisoners ?"

The Attorney-General—" I have no other charge My Lord."

Lord Ellenborough—" You say you have no further charge—therefore I shall order then forthwith to be discharged."

Mr. Harmer now conducted the prisoners out of the Court the back way behind the Bench, under the Piazzas of the House of Lords. An immense concourse of people were waiting in Palace-yard, in expectation that they would come out that way, but one or two persons recognized them under the Piazzas, and immediately, by their shouts, made known heir discovery to those in front of Westminster Hall.

POLITICAL INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE

In the second edition of our last publication, we stated some particulars, which had just reached us, of a rumoured insurrection in this district, and also the arrest of ten persons near Dewsbury, on a charge of treasonable practices. We shall now proceed to lay before our readers all the information which we have been able to collect upon the subject, and our researches have been conducted with great diligence, with perfect impartiality, and with the most anxious wish to come at the truth. We shall first shortly state what appears to have been the object and extent of the plot, and then detail those circumstances which either attended its development, or which have subsequently occurred. It appears, that almost immediately after the suppression of the Union Societies, established in different towns in this district for effecting a reform in Parliament, some of the most violent members associated together, in a private and clandestine manner. At these meetings it is supposed to have become a question for deliberation, whether a change in the representation might not be effected without the intervention of Parliament, and a project to effect this purpose appears to have been communicated to them by Mr. Oliver, who had been introduced to these Ultra Reformers by Mitchell, (a Delegate, now in custody,) as a person deserving their confidence, and not only disposed to communicate to them interesting information as to the state of the country; but able to afford them the most affectual assistance ; thus recommended, he soon possessed himself of their unbound confidence. This person is said to have represented to these credulous men, that all the people in the metropolis were favourable to a complete change of Government, that every thing was organised, and that it was absolutely settled, that on the night preceding the trial of the state prisoners, (the night of the 8th June,) a general rising, would take place; that as a consequence of this movement, all the public offices were to be taken possession of, all the constituted authorities seized, and the state prisoners released ; and that a plan had also been arranged for securing all the military, by which means a change in the government would be effected, without any effusion blood. It was further represented to them, that in order to carry out this bloodless revolution, it was absolutely necessary that the same plan should be simultaneously acted upon in all parts of the country ;- that it was therefore necessary, that on the night agreed upon, namely on Sunday the 8th inst. all the military in every district of the kingdom should be secured in their quarters, their arms seized, and that the magistrates and other civil officers should be arrested and placed in a state of restraint, not merely that no opposition might be made to the designs of the insurgents, but that they might serve as hostages for the safety of such of their own party as might fall into the hands of government. This absurd and wicked project is said to have been entertained, and in some degree acted upon, by a number of individuals in different parts of this district ; and a participation in this plot is alleged against the persons who were apprehended yesterday se'nnigh, at Thornill Lees, charged with having assembled there, for the purpose of carrying into immediate effect this daring and traitorous project. Our readers will probably infer, from this statement, that the person introduced by Mitchell to the Ultra Reformers, was, in truth, a spy, and that every step taken towards the execution of the project, had been communicated to persons in authority, as the plot appears to have been known by some of the Magistrates for several weeks past. On Friday morning last, several of the Delegates, together with the informer, met at a public house, in this town, and proceeded in the direction of Dewsbury, and from thence to Thornhill Lees, where they had no sooner arrived at the house of rendezvous than they were surrounded by a detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, and taken into custody. The following is a correct list of the names and places of residence of the persons apprehended:

John Smaller, shoemaker, Horbury, near Wakefield.  
Thomas Murray, Flax-Weaver, Leeds.  
James Mann, Cloth-Dresser, Leeds.  
Thomas Wood, Clothier, Westgate Common, Wakefield.  
Michael Waller, a Publican, and formerly keeper of the Yew-Tree, Robert-Town.
Miles Illingworth, Carpenter, Manningham, near Bradford.  
Benjamin Whitley. Cloth-Dresser, Holmfirth.  
Edward Fletcher, Card-Maker, High-Town.  
Joseph Midgley, Clothier, Almondbury.  
Wm. Walker, Clothier, Thornhill, near Dewsbury.

The prisoners were immediately conveyed in carriages, escorted by the Yeomanry Cavalry, to Wakefield, and lodged in the Court-House, where they were examined for several hours by Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry Esq., and other magistrates there assembled. The examination was private; some circumstances have, however, transpired, which we shall state. It was asserted by one of the witnesses examined, that in a barn at Whitley, near the place of meeting, there were deposited one hundred pikes, and 50 stand of fire arms; it was further stated by the same witness, that in the house of John Smaller, of Horbury, would be found a quantity of ball cartridges. Messengers were instantly dispatched to search both these places, and it is important to state, that, on removing the straw in the barn, not a single pike or fire arm could be discovered, and it was the opinion of the persons who searched the premises, that the straw had not been disturbed for a considerable time. That part of the evidence which related to the ball cartridges was also falsified, nothing of the kind having been found in the house of Smaller. We have introduced the result of these important searches in this place, though, in the order of the narrative, it ought to have been introduced somewhat later. The Court-House at Wakefield, was surrounded by an immense assemblage of persons during the whole of the examination. About eight o'clock the prisoners were remanded until Monday, to the House of Correction, for further examination. They were escorted by the cavalry, who were dismounted, the escort was attacked by the populace with stones, brick-bats, &c. thrown with great violence. The prisoners were, however, safely lodged tn the House of Correction.

On Saturday, the succeeding day, two troops of the 13th regiment of Light Dragoons arrived in this town, from York, and that day and Sunday passed over without the slightest indication of insubordination, though not without alarm ; for about midnight on Sunday, the town was thrown into the greatest consternation by the bugle sounding for the Cavalry, who remained on duty at he Court-House all night, in consequence of some alarming reports which had reached the magistrates, (who were also at the Court-House,) of an intention to rescue the prisoners at Wakfield. An express was immediately sent there to call out the Yeomanry Cavalry, who instantly assembled and continued on duty all day. No attempts at release were made, and the day passed over at Wakefield in tranquillity. We regret, however, to state, that an attempt was made in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to assassinate one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, about one o'clock on Monday morning, by firing a loaded pistol, the ball of which lodged in the forehead of the horse belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Huddersfield, but the ball has been extracted, and the horse is likely to recover. We understand that an outrage of a similar nature, was committed the same night, at Ossett, a village near Dewsbury, where the house of a member of the Yeomanry Cavalry was beset by a number of persons who demanded his arms, and on his refusal to give them up, fired several shots into the house. Five persons have been apprehended at Huddersfield, and its neighbourhood, on a charge of being concerned in the former of these daring outrages.— They have since been committed to York Castle, on a charge of malicious firing: they passed through this place yesterday afternoon, accompanied by an escort of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry.

The following is a list of their names and residence:

Abram Oldbarn, and John Oldham, of Honley.  
Isaac Johnson, and Joshua Knowles, of Holmfirth.  
John Rhodes, (late of Holbeck), Holmfirth.  

The re-examination of the prisoners charged with High Treason, took place at the House of Correction, in Wakefield, on Monday, where the Magistrates were holding a special Session for enquiring into the state of that gaol. The number of gentlemen on the Commission who attended on this occasion was uncommonly great, among others, were Sir F. L. Wood, Bart. Rev. W. R. Hay, (Chairman of the Manchester Sessions,) Rev. Wm. Wood, Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and Benj Haigh Allen, Esq., Wm. Prest, Esq. the Mayor of this borough, was also present. This examination was, in the strictest sense, private, as no person, except the Magistrates, was suffered to remain in the room during the discussion of this subject. The prisoners were merely examined *pro forma*; they were brought into the room separately, and informed that their further examination was deferred until the following Monday, until which time they were re-committed. No witnesses were examined affecting the prisoners, and the meeting might rather be termed a Committee of inquiry, than a meeting of Justices for the judicial examination of prisoners. It may be presumed from this unusually long adjournment of the examination, that no evidence has yet been given against the prisoners which can warrant their committal for High Treason, and it is reasonable the re-committal has been with the view of detaining them until instructions can be received from government as to their ultimate disposal. We understand that some important papers have been found in the House of James Mann, the Leeds Delegate. In using the term *delegate*, we do not mean to insinuate that these persons have been elected by any body of men whatever; there is no evidence of any such delegation, and the probability is, that they represent nobody but themselves. We think it right to make this remark, lest it should be supposed that they were delegated by the places where they appear to be resident, which would have given a very formidable aspect to this plot, and a degree of importance to which it is by no means entitled. The conspiracy appears to have been confined to a relatively small number of persons, and was of a nature which the laws of the country afforded ample means to suppress. It appears also to have been of a very recent date, and to have originated in the injudicious, and we will add, unconstitutional measures adopted by Ministers to seek the expression of the public feeling relative to a  Reform in Parliament. It must be further remembered, that the account we have given of the plot must be considered in the nature of an *ex-parte* statement, and must rest for its credibility, very considerably, on the reliance which can be placed on the witnesses, who do not come before the public in a light which entitle them to much credit, and whose evidence has been materially broken in upon, by circumstances stated in the above account. It must be further recollected, that all the persons apprehended are of the lowest class of society,illiterate, and ill-informed, and liable to be the dupes of designing men. The great mass of the people are, we are convinced, free from any knowledge or concurrence in the plot. In short, when the whole is dispassionately considered, there appears no ground for that excessive panic and alarm which the first announcement of the plot produced, much less does afford any legitimate ground for a renewed suspension of the Constitutional rights of the people.

We feel great satisfaction in having to state that the most perfect tranquillity has prevailed here during the whole of the past week, and that the alarm by which the announcement of so many plots had produced, has nearly subsided.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14 June 1817

SECOND EDITION

Since the first edition of our paper was prepared for the press, the highly important fact has been communicated to us, from a respectable quarter, that the plot referred to in the above statement has been got up under the instigation of an agent from London, and that the principal offender has been suffered to escape with impunity. In confirmation of this fact, which was communicated to us at a late hour yesterday afternoon, we were referred to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, in Dewsbury. To develop a transaction so important, not only to the Government and the people of this country in general, but so intimately connected with the liberty and lives of the accused, we felt it to be our imperious duty to repair to Dewsbury, without a moment's delay, and there to ascertain, on the spot, the truth of the allegation.

As a precautionary measure, we drove to the house of one of the first merchant-manufacturers in the town, and Mr. Willans be sent for, he suggested, that in order to render the investigation complete, Mr. John Dickinson, a linen-draper in that place, should be invited to attend. This suggestion being adopted, Mr. Dickinson also attended, and the following is the result of our investigations into the mysterious transactions which formed the subject of our inquiry:—

Mr Willans stated, and the truth of his assertions his is willing to confirm by his solemn affirmation, that, about two months ago, a person of the name of *Oliver*, called upon him, and introduced himself as a Parliamentary Reformer, sent form London, to ascertain the dispositions of the people in the country. This man he describes as a person of genteel appearance and good address, nearly six feet high, of erect figure, light hair, red and rather large whiskers, and a full face a little pitted with the small-pox. His usual dress, he says, was a light fashionable coloured brown coat, black waistcoat, dark blue mixture pantaloons, and Wellington boots. The description of such a character is important, and may form a clue to further discoveries, connected with his proceedings in other parts of the country.

Mr. Oliver, he says, called upon him several times after his first introduction, and in one of his subsequent calls, said, that as it was quite obvious that Government would not listen to the petitions of the people, it had now become necessary that they should be compelled to attend to their demands. These insinuations Mr. Willans silenced by the observation, that he could not engage in any proceeding that implied the use of force, or the shedding of human blood. On another occasion, Mr. Oliver told him, that he (Oliver) was one of a committee of five that effected the escape of young Watson, and that if Thistlewood had had equally prudent counsels, he would also have escaped. In fact, the whole tenor of Oliver's conversation went to show that he had traitorous designs, and that he was in league with traitors.

Such conversation, as might be supposed, awaked Mr. Willans's suspicions, and the intercourse between them had almost ceased, when, on Friday morning last, the day the ten persons were arrested at Thornhill Lees near Dewsbury, he again called at Mr. Willan's shop between 10 and 11 o'clock, and Mr. W. being absent on business, he begged that his wife would tell him, that a meeting of delegates was to be held on that day, at Thornhill, and earnestly requested that she would use her influence to prevail upon her husband to attend. Before Oliver quitted Dewsbury to attend the meeting, he called again at the shop, when he found Mr. Willans had returned. He accordingly renewed his solicitations to Mr. W. to attend the meeting, telling him at the same time, that "*his friends in London "were almost heart-broken that the people in the country were so quiet.*" At the same time he informed him, that he had walked over from Leeds that morning, and two persons supposed to be Leeds men, appeared in his train. Unmoved by Oliver's solicitations, Mr. Willans persisted in his resolution not to attend the meeting, and owing to his obstinacy, Dewsbury was prevented from swelling the number of *deputies*, so called.

At the appointed time, the meeting was held at Thornhill Lees, and the toils being set, eleven deputies, Mr. Oliver being of the number, were taken by a detachment of cavalry, and all except Mr. Oliver, who had the *good fortune* to be liberated, were conveyed to Wakefield in custody.

While the examinations were proceeding at the Court-House, Mr. Oliver had repaired to his quarters, which were at the Strafford-Arms, that is, the head inn in Wakefield. Here, to his great consternation and confusion, he was recognized by Mr. John Dickinson, who had seen him at Dewsbury, and had heard that he was a leading man at the private meetings. Advancing up to Oliver, Mr. Dickinson addressed him, and the following conversation took place:

*Mr. Dickinson.* How does it happen, Mr. Oliver, that you, who appear to have taken so leading a part in the meetings, are at liberty, while your associates are likely to be sent in custody to London?

*Mr. Oliver.* No papers were found upon me, and being a *stranger*, the persons who apprehended us were obliged to set me at liberty.

These observations were made in a very hurried manner, and Mr. Oliver withdrew to take a seat in the Wakefield coach to Leeds.

As soon as Mr. Oliver had placed himself in the coach, a servant in livery stepped up to him, and, moving his hat, entered into conversation with him.

This circumstance, combined with the extraordinary reasons that Oliver had given for his liberation, induced Mr. Dickinson to inquire of the servant, after the coach had left the inn, if he knew that Gentleman ? to which the servant replied, that he had seen him at Campsall, and he had driven him a few days before in his master's tandem from that place to the Red-house to meet the coach. On receiving this information, Mr. Dickinson enquired who his master was ? to which the servant replied, General Byng. He then left him, and asked Mr. Tyler, who keeps the Strafford Arms, if he knew Oliver ? to which Mr. Tyler replied, that he had been there several times — that he believed he was form London — and that several London letters had come directed to him at that inn.

From every thing we have heard of the character and conduct of General Byng, we are persuaded that he has been merely the medium for receiving Oliver's information, and that whoever may have employed this double-distilled traitor, the General has acted merely in the discharge of his official duty. But every circumstance we have just related, proves, that somebody has employed him, and the question is— who were his employers?

What the trade of this man may be, we cannot pretend to say—but that he is a *Green Bag Maker* by profession is, we think, sufficiently obvious. Why such a wretch, the main spring and master-piece of the conspiracy, by which the country has been thrown into its present state of alarm and agitation, was suffered to escape, while the poor unfortunate victims of his machinations are held in confinement, is more than we can say; but the subject requires deep and grave investigation, and we call upon the magistrates of this riding, now that we have given them the clue, to go to the bottom of this nefarious transaction.

We ask this boon from them in support of their own character— we ask it from a regard to the character of the country— we ask it from a regard to the Government— we ask it in justice to the advocates of Parliamentary Reform— and above all, we conjure them to enter into this inquiry, from a regard to all the families and the lives of the men at present in confinement, on the information of this prototype of Lucifer, whose distinguishing characteristic it is, first to tempt and then to destroy.

We have been favoured with the following extract of a letter received yesterday from Nottingham, by a Mercantile house in this town :-

"*Nottingham, June 12th, 1817.*

An insurrection was fully expected by the Magistrates to have begun here on the 9th inst. We remained, however, perfectly quiet ; but on the 10th, a great number of persons out of Derbyshire, armed with pikes and guns, which they stole on their route, approached this place: they advanced as far as Eastwood (8 miles distant) where they were encountered by Mr. Rolleston, a very active county Magistrate, supported by a troop of dragoons, when they immediately fled in all directions, leaving about 26 of their number prisoners, who were conducted forthwith to the County gaol ; one person was shot dead by the *insurgents* for not delivering up his arms when required, and another was shot by accident; these, we believe, are all the casualties that have occurred. We are perfectly quiet at present, and the Magistrates are very active. We hope, therefore, that there is an end of the business."

The neighbourhood of Huddersfield was thrown into consternation on Sunday night, by an attack made about 12 o'clock, on six of the horse-patrole, at Folly-Hall Bridge, near that place, by a number of men with arms. A volley was fired, and one of the horses struck on the head, by a ball, which has since been extracted. The patrole finding their number too small to attack their adversaries, retired after a shot had been fired by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was wounded; and by the time the main body with the infantry reached the place, the whole of the assailants had dispersed.

...

The Secret Committee of the House of Commons, which is expected to recommend the continued Suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act, was appointed on Thursday. It differs only from, the former Committee in the substitution of the present Solicitor-General for the late Attorney-General. ...

EXPLODED PLOTS.

The inquisition made in our last paper of the plotters against the public tranquility, has produced a sensation in the Metropolis – the Senate – and the nation at large, that has seldom been exceeded. One of its first effects was to procure the liberation of the principal part of the persons charged with holding a political meeting for treasonable purposes, at Thornill Lees, in this county ; and the magistrates of the West Riding, with a proper regard to their own characters and to the public interest, have done themselves lasting honour, by setting at liberty the men, whom a perfidious conspirator, acting under a superior agency, had marked out for his victims. By this exposure, the secret springs of a diabolical conspiracy, not of the people, but against the people, have been laid bare. The real conspirators have been exhibited to public view.

The nature and the objects of the plots have been disclosed, and all the trepidation and alarm with which the public had been seized, have given way to an universally felt indignation against the alarmists and their emissaries. The effect has been almost magical. The blow aimed at the friends to reform, has been made, by a retributive recoil, to fall upon the heads of their adversaries, and every man with an English heart in his bosom, whatever his party or his political predilections, feels himself insulted and outraged by the attempts made to convert the most populous and important part of the kingdom into a scene of conspiracies, and his countrymen into a nation of traitors.

The account published in the second edition of our last paper, and which will be found in the parliamentary proceedings of the present week, has proved to be in every important particular correct. From that account it appeared — that the Yorkshire Plot was *got up* by a political agent of the name of Oliver, from London— that this man, under the guise of an ardent zeal for the cause of Parliamentary Reform, did not hesitate to suggest to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, at Dewsbury, the propriety and necessity of resorting to force for the purpose of compelling Government to grant that by coercion, which they were disinclined to concede to petitions. That, on the day when the meeting  at Thornhill was appointed to be held, he endeavoured, by the most urgent entreaties, to prevail upon Mr. Willans to attend that meeting, and that in the course of conversation, he told Mr. W. that "his" Mr. Oliver's "friends in London were almost heart-broken that the people in the country were so quiet." Who Mr. Oliver's friends, or at least his employers, are, the Earl of Liverpool has, with great candour, informed the country ; but why they should be so much disquieted at the tranquility of the people, we shall not pretend to conjecture. It further appeared, from the statement above referred to, that Mr. Willans refused to attend the meeting at Thornhill, and that Dewsbury was thereby deprived of a *deputy*. Whatever might be the disinclination of Mr. Willans to attend the meeting, Mr. Oliver, it seems, was not actuated by the same motives — he attended— was taken into custody along with ten other delegates, and was suffered to escape "because he was a stranger, and had no papers about him." The next appearance of this stranger was at Wakefield, on the day and at the moment when the persons apprehended with him were under examination before the magistrates at that place, and there it was discovered by a singular train of incidents, that a few days before the meeting at Thornhill, Oliver was at the house of General Sir John Byng, the commander of the district, and that he was conveyed in the General's tandem to meet the coach, which bore him to the scene of his delinquencies. This discovery, so fortunate for the country, will be considered as a special interposition of a Superintending Power, in favour of the country; and we may say with truth, "the finger of Providence was there."

On this part of the exposure a few observations will suffice. Every link of the chain of evidence is perfect. The conduct of Oliver, the informer, admits of no further disguise-it is perfectly clear that he instigated persons to attend at Thornhill, on the day in question, and there is reason to suppose that he himself appointed the meeting. What were his instructions we cannot say, but he is completely identified with men in an official situation, by a species of evidence that scarcely stood in need of the admission made by Lord Liverpool, that he was an agent of Government. But, says his Lordship, the account in the Leeds Mercury is an *ex parte* statement, and as such must not be implicitly relied upon. That is true, my Lord, and our anxiety is, that it should no longer be *ex parte*. We invite your Lordship to deprive it of this character, by a rigorous investigation into all the facts of the case; and this investigation, we beseech your Lordship and your colleagues to institute, before the Suspension Bill, founded upon these alleged conspiracies, is suffered to advance another stage in its progress. Whether the bill to renew to Ministers the power of exercising a despotic control over the liberties of their countrymen, has produced the plots, or the plots have produced the bill, it is not our present business to inquire ; but we feel it our duty to say, as a circumstance coming within our own knowledge, that, in the inquiries which we made at Dewsbury, the day before the facts we have developed were laid before for the public, we never recollect to have heard a witness give his evidence, even in a court of justice, and upon oath, with a more scrupulous regard to truth than Mr. Willans. If he erred, as he certainly did, in suffering a traitor like Oliver to come near his house, after he had, by insinuation, communicated his villainous designs, he has made ample reparation to his country for his error, by having first declined to attend a meeting, the object of which he considered to be mischievous, and then, by making those disclosures, even at the risk of the obloquy to which they were sure to subject him, which have tended to put down a system of *espionage*, contemplating first the seduction of his Majesty's subjects from their allegiance, and then the destruction of the seduced and the extinction of public liberty. Mr. Dickinson's evidence, which was given with the utmost frankness, Lord Liverpool has confirmed, by the acknowledgement that Oliver was an agent of Government, and in that capacity, it seems, was in communication with the commander of the district.

Mr. Oliver, thee political incendiary, made his first appearance in Yorkshire about nine or ten weeks ago, accompanied by one Mitchell, a Liverpool *delegate*, (now in custody) under the assumed character of a zealous Parliamentary Reformer, whose object it was to ascertain the dispositions of the people, and to give to the sluggish current of public feeling a due degree of fervour. On his arrival in Wakefield, by the True Briton Coach, he called upon Mr. Benjamin Scholes, a publican in that place, a person who had taken a leading part in a meeting recently held, for the purpose of petitioning the Legislature, for a Reform in the representation of the people, and as a specimen of the manner in which Mr. Oliver executed his mission, we shall state the substance of a deposition made by Mr. Scholes, before J. P. Heywood, Esq. one of the magistrates of this riding:—

TESTIMONY OF MR. SCHOLES.

On his first interview with Mr. Scholes, Oliver said, that he was charged to present Sir Francis Burdett's compliments to him, and to inform him that he was delegated by the Baronet, Lord Cochrane, Major Cartwright, Mr. Hunt, and other gentlemen, to examine into the state of the country, and to learn whether the country meant to sit down with their petitions being rejected or not. Mr. Scholes said, he could not speak for others, but for himself he must say, that though he believed he was among the most zealous of the Parliamentary Reformers in Wakefield, he would go as far as petitioning went, but no further. Some conversation then took place on the subject of the Wakefield petition, on which Oliver observed, that " it was very good, but it did not go far enough." Mr Scholes replied that they did not mean to interfere any further, and he referred Mr. Oliver, for information as to the views of the reformers, to Mr. Hurst, the printer of the Wakefield Journal, Mr. Dealtry, at one of the West Riding Magistrates, Mr. Egremont, a gentleman of independent fortune in the neighbourhood, and other gentlemen, who had signed the petition. Mr. Scholes cannot say whether Oliver applied to these gentlemen, but in point of fact we believe he did not. His dupes were to be found among the distressed and the ignorant, and it was to those principally that he addressed himself. Oliver then requested Mr. Scholes to furnish him with the names of such persons, in the neighbouring villages, as were favourable to Reform, which he did, and, amongst others, he mentioned John Smaller, of Horbury. Having thus far felt his way, Oliver next proposed to Mr. Scholes that he should accompany him to Manchester and Liverpool, on his political mission, and promised that he would both pay his expenses, and satisfy him for his trouble. This proposal Mr. Scholes declined. Some time after Oliver again called at Mr. Scholes's, and proposed a walk into the country, to examine the newly erected asylum, stating that he had some skill in architecture. During their walk the subject of Parliamentary Reform was resumed, and Oliver observed that Sir Francis Burdett and the other gentlemen by whom he was delegated were astonished that the country was not more alive to the subject of Parliamentary Reform. "I asked him," says Mr. Scholes, " what he meant by being alive," and he replied, "*if petitioning will not do, we must use physical force*." "Physical force," rejoined Mr.  Scholes, indignantly, " the country must not be thrown into a state of insubordination, and I will have nothing to do with plunging the country into anarchy." Thus repulsed , Mr. Oliver dropped the conversation. The third and last time that Mr. Oliver called upon Mr. Scholes, it was for the purpose of inviting him to attend a meeting which Oliver said he had appointed, at Penistone, in this Riding, for discussing a plan of Parliamentary Reform. This meeting Mr. Scholes positively refused to attend, telling Oliver, at the same time, that he believed he was a bad man, and that he would not only not attetid this meeting himself, but he would also dissuade any other persons, over that whom he might have any influence, from attending it. He further asked him his reason for staying so long in this part of the country, as he must be satisfied that his project of resorting to force would not be encouraged. Oliver replied, that he did not dare to return to London till the State Trials were over, and, on being asked the cause of his fears, he said he had assisted young Watson in effecting his escape. In this conversation Oliver expressed himself dissatisfied with the apathy of the country, in proof of proof of which, he said he had appointed two meetings at Huddersfield, and when he got there not a single individual had attended. At parting, Mr. Scholes said and to Oliver, "Now. Sir, I beg, that from this time, you will never call upon me again." In the course of the evening, several men, who were drinking in Mr. Scholes's house, told him that Oliver had appointed a meeting at Penistone the next day, and asked him his opinion of Oliver and his measures ; to which he replied, "for God's Sake keep from Oliver and his meetings, for he is a base villain."

From the period of the Penistone meeting, which, we believe, was held on the 1st of June, till the eve of the Thornhill meeting on the 6th of June, we have no specific information respecting the operations of Mr. Oliver, but we understand, that a little before the time of the former meeting, this incendiary made a journey to London, and that, in the interval, he was travelling about in the counties of Nottingham, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Lancasihire, lahouring, no doubt, in his vocation. For the honour of human nature, we hope that the use made by Mr. Oliver of the names of Sir Francis Burdett, Major Cartwright, and others, was not authorized by Ministers ; but after such a specimen of the vile arts employed to traduce the friends of Parliamentary Reform, we are not in future to be surprised at any caluminies that may be propagated against them.

We have already stated, from the testimony of Mr. Willans and Mr. Dickinson, how Mr. Oliver was engaged in some parts of the day on Friday, the 6th of June, and the grateful feelings of one of the persons discharged by the Magistrates on Monday, has afforded us a clue to his proceedings in the early as well as the more interesting parts of the same day. Last Tuesday morning, a person of the name of Thomas Murray, one of the Leeds *delegates*, so called, waited upon us, to exprees his acknowledgments, and the thanks of the persons who had been imprisoned with him in Wakefield House of Correction, for the services which they conceived we had rendered to them, in contributing to their liberation, by exposing the real conspirators. After he had explained his business, we inquired how it happened that he had attended the meeting at Thornhill, and what was the nature of his delegation ? To this he replied that he would explain the whole matter, as far as he was acquainted with the business, and the following narrative, which was delivered in the most artless manner, he is ready, we understand, to confirm upon oath:—

TESTIMONY OF THOMAS MURRAY.

THOMAS MURRAY is a linen-weaver, in the employment of Messrs. Benyon, Benyon, and Bage, of this place, and says, that on Friday morning, the 6th of June,about half-past seven o'clock, he was standing near his master's works in Meadow-lane, near the junction of the two roads from Leeds to Dewsbury, to along with a young man of the name of Thomas Dovner, when a person with the appearance of a gentleman, answering to the description given of Mr. Oliver not in the second edition of the Leeds Mercury of last Saturday, walked up to them and inquired the road to Dewsbury. On the road being pointed out to him, he inquired how much further Thornhill was than Dewsbury, and was told two miles. He then asked Murray if he was out of employment ? and on being told that he was for that day, owing to the woman who assisted him in his business being obliged to remain at home to attend to her family; Oliver observed that he had some business at Thornhill, and being an *entire stranger* in that part of the country, he should be glad if he would accompany him and show him the way, for which services he would reward him, by paying his expenses, and satisfying him for his day's work. After some persuasions Murray was prevailed upon to go, and on their way to Dewsbury they regaled themselves at the public-house at Stump-Cross with a shillings'-worth of rum and milk, for which Oliver paid. During the journey the subject of politics was never introduced but once, and then Oliver informed his guide, that " Mr. Abbot was elevated to the Peerage, and he was glad of it, for he was an impartial clever little fellow." On their arrival at Dewsbury, Oliver went into a small bookseller's shop, (Mr. Willans's) and requested his guide to wait for him at the door. When he came out, he said, the person he wished to see was not in, and they then went into an adjoining public-house, where they again refreshed themselves at Mr. Oliver's expense. While they were in the house a woman came in, which Murray believes was Mr. Willans's wife, and said, that her husband had come in, on which Oliver immediately followed her into the bookseller's shop, and in the space of about a quarter of an hour returned. Murray and he then proceeded on their way to Thornhill, and when they had arrived in a lane about one hundred yards from the Sportsman's Arms, they saw three gentlemen, one of them being Major-General Sir John Byng, riding up to meet them at full speed. On their approach, Sir John advanced up to Oliver, and pointing with his finger, said, " I think I know you, Sir." Oliver, affecting to be overcome with fright, made no reply. Sir Jorn then said, "I have had an accurate description of to you from London  ! Sir, is not your name Oliver ?" Oliver still remained silent, and by the orders of Sir John he was surrounded by a party of cavalry and taken into custody. Sir John then called to another detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, who were on the road, to stop Murray, which they did, and after driving him into the ditch, they dragged him into the Sportsman's Arms public-house. Here they searched the person of the Leeds *Delegate*, but found not a single scrap of paper upon him. At that time there were about five or six persons in the room all in custody, and he learned that they had all been picked up in different parts of the neighbourhood. When they had been in the public-house about half an hour, several post chaises, which seem to have been previously prepared, drove up to the door, and in them they were conveyed, under an escort of Yeomanry Cavalry, to the Court-house at Wakefield. From the time that Murray was apprehended, up to the period of his discharge, he never saw Oliver but once, and then he was brought into the room at the Sportsman's Arms in custody, but he had not remained there above half minute, when he was called out of the room by Sir John Byng, and never again appeared. After the examination at Wakefield, Murray and his fellow *delegates*, not one of whom, to the best of his knowledge, he had ever before seen, were committed to the House of Correction, and were there kept for eleven days in solitary confinement, and on the prison allowance.

Such are the statements that we have received from the mouths of the persons whose names they bear. That they are in all their leading particulars correct, we have not the slightest doubt. They are published with the honest intention of tranquillizintg the public mind, of justifying the innocent, and of exposing the guilty. Had we consulted either our own ease, or our personal safety, we should have shrunk, in times like these, from the responsibility of this exposure, but there is a feeling of the mind paramount to all these considerations— a sense of public duty, and by that principle alone we have been actuated.

The same spirit of candid inquiry and love of truth, which has, we hope, displayed itself in every part of our conduct in these mysterious transactions, induces us to present our readers with the following letter addressed to the Editor of this paper, and received yesterday morning, from Major General Sir John Byng, the commander of the district.

LETTER OF GENERAL BYNG.

" St. James's Square, (London) June 18th, 1817.  
" Sir,-You have introduced my name into your last paper in such a manner as to induce me to desire the insertion, in your next, of the following statement:-

"You have suffered it to be inferred, that a person of the name of Oliver, was employed by me— that he entrapped the persons taken up at Thornhill-Leys, and that he left London with the view of exciting and fomenting discontent and disturbance in different parts of the country. Not one word of this is true:— before Oliver left London, information had been transmitted tome, from Nottingham, of an intended rising in the manufacturing in the North of England and Scotland: this information was only a repetition of what I had reason to expect for several weeks, if the notion of Sir Francis Burdett, for a Reform in Parliament, should be rejected. The information from Nottingham was subsequently corroborated so fully to me from various quarters, and the 9th of June being from all fixed upon as the period of rising, I was induced, on Monday the 2d of June, to wait upon Sir Francis Wood, and communicate to him what I knew, who deemed my information of sufficient importance to propose a meeting of the Magistracy at Barnsley, for Friday, the 6th. On Wednesday, the 4th, I, for the first time, saw or heard from Oliver, who gave me some information corroborative of that I had before received, and further told me that there would be a meeting of delegates at Cleckheaton on Friday, the 6th. Mr. Parker communicated, on the 5th., to Sir Francis Wood and myself, that he had at Sheffield information given, upon oath, that a meeting of persons, who were finally to decide upon the plan for the 9th, would be held at the Sportsman's Arms, at Thornhill Lees, at 11, on Friday the 6th, and suggested the propriety of arresting these delegates, to prevent the fatal consequences which might ensue on the 9th:— this suggestion was agreed to at Barnsley, on the morning of the 6th. When the Magistrate' (Mr. Chandler) and myself arrived at Thornhill, although some time after the hour of the proposed meeting, Oliver was not come, having been deceived as to the place of the meeting, which, as I have before stated, he expected was to be at Cleckheaton, and so far from having entrapped the men arrested, he only knew one of them by name, (which, in fairness to the individual, I will not here insert). He neither knew the real place of meeting, nor the persons assembled, and was consequently not brought before the magistrates to confirm their other evidence.

"With respect to the alleged conversation with Mr. Dickenson and Mr. Willan, I cannot speak, as I confine myself to facts ; but I have to remark, that what  is imputed to Oliver by them, is a direct contradiction to what he stated as his general line of conduct, and is quite contrary to what he considered his instructions, which were confined solely to give any Magistrate, or myself, information necessary for preserving the peace of the country.

"It only remains for me to add, that I am not empowered to hire any person— that I have never, directly or indirectly, paid any thing for the information I have received, which has hitherto been communicated to me from respectable authority, and from a far better motive than any mercenary consideration.

"I am, Sir,  
"Your humble Servant,  
"JOHN BYNG, Major-General."  
To Mr. Edward Baines, at the Mercury-Office, Leeds."

In justice to ourselves, it is proper to remark, that in our paper of last week, we stated facts, rather than drew inferences, and that not one of those facts has been shaken by the above letter. We did not say that " Oliver was employed by General Byng to entrap the persons taken up at Thornhill Lees." On the contrary, we said, that " from every thing we has heard of the character and conduct of General Byng, we were persuaded that he had been merely the medium for receiving Oliver's information, and that whoever might have employed him, the General had merely acted in the discharge of his official duty" Nor did we state that Oliver "left London with the view of exciting and fomenting disturbances in different parts of the country." We could not dive into the dark recesses of Oliver's mind, and it was as impossible for us to know with what views he left London, as it must be for General Byng to speak to the same fact. But with whatever views he left London, or whatever might be the nature of the instructions he received from Ministers on his departure, we think that, after the exposure which it has fallen to our lot to make of his nefarious practices, both General Byng and the country must now be convinced, that this profligate informer has excited and fomented disturbances in different parts of the country, and in the words of the Wakefield Journal, " that had there been no Mr. Oliver there would have been no plot." That there is a great mass of dissatisfaction in the country, and that rumours of the nature alluded to in General Byng's letters, will continue to prevail as long as the public distress prevails, cannot be doubted; but that there was any concerted plan for a rising of the people, till Mr. Oliver and his co-adjutors came into the country, and injected their treasons into the minds of the people, would, we apprehend, be very difficult to prove. Even with Mr. Oliver's assistance, the meeting at Thornhill, if a meeting it could be called, was a most pitiful assembly, and General Byng, we are convinced, when he saw the materials of which that meeting was composed, must have perceived, that all apprehensions of the West Riding of Yorkshire being three days afterwards thrown into a state of insurrection, were utterly groundless. When the General uses the word *delegates*, he must, we presume, apply it in the popular and not in the correct acceptation of the term. It is our firm conviction, that not a single individual present, Mr. Oliver alone excepted, was clothed with delegated powers. The narrative of Thomas Murray, given above, proves very clearly what sort of delegation he possessed ; and from every thing we can learn, we are persuaded, that the other delegates just as much represented the places where they happened to reside, as Thomas Murray represented the town of Leeds. General Byng's mode of accounting for Oliver's late attendance at the meeting, is proved by the testimony of Murray to be incorrect, (unintentionally so, no doubt.) We find this man in Leeds, twelve miles only from the place of meeting at half-past, seven o'clock in the morning of Friday, the 6th of June, inquiring, not for *Cleckheaton*, but for *Dewsbury* and *Thornhill*; and we find also, from the concurrent testimony of Mr. Willans and Thomas Murray, that the principal cause of his late attendance was, his wish to seduce Mr. Willans to attend that meeting, to which he had, by a different artifice, decoyed Thomas Murray. General Byng's disavowal of the possession of any powers to hire persons to give him information, we do not call in question, though we do not perceive the propriety of making such a disclaimer, when the conduct of a confessedly *hired* spy is under discussion. It is a matter of perfect indifference to the public, whether Mr. Oliver's remuneration stands under the head of " Secret Service Money," or of "Army Estimates."

The observation of Lord Liverpool, that Mr. Oliver was sent by Government to discover, and not to form plots, may be true, but a first Minister of State ought to know, that when a spy cannot find a plot, he will make one ; and when he knows that his employers have a *Green Bag* to fill, he will not fail to present them with his well-timed contributions. But Lord Liverpool, in some of the reports of his speech, says, that if Oliver has practised the arts alleged against him, and endeavoured to excite the people to treasonable acts, he has exceeded his instructions. In that case, let him be brought to justice. Overt acts of treason have been committed, and Mr. Oliver, an avowed agent of Ministers, has perpetrated the crime. Either the agent or the principals are guilty. If he be not tried, they ought to be impeached. Impartial justice, and the loudly raised voice of the country, demands it ; and it is the duty of Parliament to see that so reasonable a demand is satisfied.

...

EXAMINATION AT WAKEFIELD

On Monday, a numerous meeting of the Magistrates of the West-Riding was held in the Sessions Room at the House of Correction, Wakefield, for the purpose of investigating the cases of the persons recently apprehended at Thornhill-Lees, on a charge of treasonable practices; present, the Right Hon. Earl Fitwilliam (Lord-Lieutenant), in the Chair; Sir Francis Linley Wood, Bart. Rev. Wm. Wood, Clerk, J. P. Heywood, Benj. Dealtry, Godfrey Higgins, Hugh Parker, Michael Stocks, Thomas Horton, Thomas Benyon, and Wm. Bairstow, Esqrs. Wm. Prest, Esq. Mayor of Leeds, was also present. The numerous attendance of the Magistracy on this occasion, was, we have reason to believe, produced by the exposure in our last publication of the diabolical and treasonable machinations of Oliver, the Government Spy. The examination was private — a circumstance which we regret, because it will prevent us from giving that full account of the investigation which we were desirous to present to the country, and which would, we are persuaded, have tended essentially to tranquillize the public mind.

After the examination of William Bradley of Sheffield, on whose information the prisoners had been committed, Mr. John Dickinson, of Dewsbury, was called in and examined touching the circumstances of Oliver's conduct. This gentleman's examination occupied nearly two hours, in the course of which, we understand, he confirmed, upon oath, the circumstances detailed in the Second Edition of our last Paper, and Earl Fitzwilliam, the Lord-Lieutenant, took down the evidence with great minuteness.

Mr. James Willan, the bookseller, was next called, and expressed his readiness to state his evidence, relative to the attempts made by Oliver to seduce him from his allegiance, on his solemn affirmation, but this being a criminal case, the affirmation of a Quaker is not admissible, and he was obliged to withdraw without giving his evidence.

The examination of the witnesses continued several hours, and the Magistrates, after deliberating some time on the evidence, directed that

Thomas Murray, of Leeds, Michael Walker of Robert-Town, Miles Illingworth of Manningham,  Edward Fletcher of High-Town, Joseph Midgley of Almondbury, & William Walker of Thornhill should be discharged on their own recognizances.

Thomas Wood, of Westgate-Common, Wakefield, was also discharged, on finding bail, himself in £40, and two sureties in £20 each.

Benjamin Whitley, of Holmfirth, was remanded until Friday, when he was told that he would be discharged on the same terms as Thomas Wood, if no  further charge was preferred against him.

And John Smaller, of Horbury, and James Mann, of Leeds, were then brought up and discharged; but were immediately taken into custody by a King's Messenger, under a warrant signed by Lord Sidmouth, and were sent off the same evening in a post chaise to London, accompanied for a short distance by a small escort of cavalry. The warrant for the apprehension of these unfortunate men is, we understand, founded on the information of the informer Oliver.

It is impossible to describe the general satisfaction which the investigation of this day produced. The discharge of the state prisoners was justly considered as a disavowal on the part of the highly respectable magistracy assembled, of any serious plot against the Government of the country, and the impression made upon the mind of the Lord Lieutenant will, we hope, have a salutary influence in another place.

TO THE EDITOR of the LEEDS MERCURY.

Sir— The insertion of the following in your paper will much oblige, Your obedient Servant, JOHN DICKINSON.

TO Mr. GRIFFITH WRIGHT.  
SIR— My astonishment would have been greatly excited by the article in your paper of the 16th inst. but coming from the quarter it does, it only serves to confirm my opinion both of the Editor and the paper.

If you would permit truth to appear, it would never have been stated, that on my being closely questioned it came out that my name was Dickinson. as I introduced myself by name nearly in the first moment of our interview, and had never the least idea of concealing it ; as to the promise of calling again, it was only conditional, viz, if my friends in Leeds should approve of my taking the responsibility upon myself.

This is my statement, and the public will decide between us ; and as my only wish was to develop the truth, I could not, neither did I expect any thing like a candour in the conduct of one always ready to support the worst measures which can be adopted for this country, and to abuse all who will not tamely bow their necks to the yoke of despotism.

Mr Spedding, the Constable of Dewsbury, has readily signed his name to the following:

'I hereby certify that John Dickinson. of Dewsbury, had full authority from me to use my name in the advertising of Oliver in the Leeds Intelligencer of the 16th of June, 1817.

'THOMAS SPEDDING, Constable of Dewsbury.'

REPORT of the COMMITTEE of SECRECY.

*Further Suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act.*

In the House of Lords, on Thursday the 12th inst. the *Earl of Harrowby* presented a Report from the Committee of Secrecy, which was read by the Reading Clerk at the table. The Report began by stating, that the Committee had taken into their serious consideration the papers referred to in the Prince Regent's Message, and they felt it their duty to state, that it appeared from the evidence before them, that the practices, meetings, and combinations, alluded to in their former Report, still continued in various parts of the country, having for their object the overthrow of the Constitution and Government, and the destruction of the established system of order and tranquillity. The evidence upon which they founded their opinion, was in part derived from persons implicated in these transactions, and from individuals who had participated in them, with the view of making communications on the subject to the Magistrates or to the Secretary of State. With respect to these latter persons, the Committee thought it right to state that in some instances they had urged on other individuals to acts of violence, instead of merely watching what these individuals did. Making, however, every allowance for the exaggerations which had thus risen, the Committee had evidence before them, of the accuracy of which there was no doubt, that disaffection to a considerable extent prevailed in the manufacturing districts in the northern parts of the kingdom. It was undoubtedly true, that in some of these districts there existed considerable distress; but it was equally true, that the distress of which actually existed must be considered the instrument rather than the cause of disaffection, it being the fact, that in many places were the pressure was most grievous, the people evinced the greatest loyalty, patience, and good order. -The Committee had found since the last Report, the practices at Manchester had been continued, and that a meeting was summoned to be held there on the 3d of March, which was numerously attended, and at which the most inflammatory language was used. It was proposed and agreed to at this meeting, to hold another meeting on to the 10th of March, and it was recommended that ten out of every twenty assembled on the latter day, should be in readiness to proceed to London, for the pretended purpose of presenting a petition to the Prince Regent, with which view they were to provide themselves with blankets, shoes, &c. The meeting was held, and attended by from 10 to 12.000 persons, notwithstanding several of the ringleaders had been previously arrested, and the project of proceeding to London was attempted to be carried into effect, but the deluded individuals were stopped through the activity of the Magistrates at different short distances, and compelled to retrace their steps. It appeared it was held oat to them that they would be joined on the road by large bodies from different towns, so that by the time they advanced towards London they would be 100,000. The grossest delusions were, in fact, held out to persons assembled upon that occasion, nor could the project itself be considered in any other light than as directed against the public tranquillity, which must necessarily have been considerably endangered by the attempt of a considerable body of men to advance in the manner proposed to London.— After this period, it appeared that the additional power entrusted to the Government had some effect, and that numerous meetings were not attempted to be held, but secret meetings were assembled in remote places; and though some societies were broken up, and some public houses would not receive them, they contrived to assemble in other houses in a lonely situation. At some of these meetings the most undisguised language was used; it was no longer Parliamentary Reform that was held up as a pretext, but Revolution was openly advocated; the individuals attempted to be influenced were called upon to provide arms (though the committee had been unable to trace any arrangement made for the actual procuring of arms), and it was even held out that persons in office, and others obnoxious to them, ought to be got rid of. A general rising was contemplated early in April, but from some circumstances it was put off till June. In the mean time, numerous meetings, in consequence of the additional power placed in the hands of Government, not being deemed advisable, a system of delegation was established, and persons calling themselves delegates assembled at different places. It was held out, that it would not be advisable to commit much to writing, and that the names of the leaders should be as much as possible concealed. These persons calling themselves delegates, repeatedly assembled, and kept up an extensive correspondence. An assembly of these delegates was held at a town in Yorkshire, early in May, at which it was determined that a general rising should take place on the 10th of June. Nottingham was to be the head quarters of the insurgents. They were to obtain arms by plundering the barracks and other depots, and to march in a large body to London. It appeared that the conspirators had even gone the length of contemplating the destruction of Manchester, for the purpose of adding to the discontent, by throwing a great number of persons out of employ. The signal was to be given by a rocket being fired; upon which the manufactories and other buildings were to be destroyed. The project was frustrated by the activity of the Magistrates, and it appeared that the project of the general uprising had also been frustrated; but there were some districts in which the parties had determined on rising, notwithstanding the determination of this meeting of delegates; and the evidence before the Committee upon this subject had been confirmed by the recent appearance of bodies of men in arms at a the precise period which is stated to have been fixed upon, an particularly in one of the districts, which had latterly been represented as determined to act without waiting for a general insurrection. The Committee, in taking this view of certain parts of the country, which was unfortunately too well supported by the evidence and documents before them, felt it their duty to state, that in other quarters there was a general feeling of loyalty and attachment to the Government ; and that, even in the disturbed districts, the greater part of the people were loyally attached to the Government. The Magistrates had displayed the greatest activity in frustrating the projects of the disaffected, and they were powerfully aided by the loyal support of the population. The Magistrates, however, were of opinion, that the most effectual means of putting down the disaffected, and frustrating their projects, had risen out of the additional powers placed in the hands of Government: and the Committee were of opinion, upon the whole view of the case, that, in order to frustrate effectually the projects of disaffection, it was absolutely necessary to continue the additional powers vested in the hands of Government, the ordinary laws being insufficient for the purpose.— The Report was laid on the table, and ordered to be printed.

ALSO: article on YEOMANRY CAVALRY givening notice to residents of Leeds that such a domestic force will be raised.

OLIVER THE SPY.-

A fact has come to our knowledge connected with the mission of this arch traitor, which, though it can be communicated in a few words, speaks volumes to the mind of every British subject. On the first arrival of Mr. Oliver in the neighbourhood of *Sheffield*, where he spread terror among the peaceable and well-disposed part of the inhabitants, and by his flattering representations imparted joy and confidence to the disaffected and evil-minded, the vigilance of the magistrates at that place enabled them to trace out his proceedings, and to discover that he was disemminating the poison of his treasons in every direction. The first use made by the magistrates of this discovery was to apprise the conservators of the public peace in other parts of the riding of the arrival of this incendiary, and their next step was to address a letter to the Secretary of State for the home department informing him that a *London Delegate*, a man apparently above the lower ranks, had arrived in the country, and was actively employed in organizing sedition and exciting the people to acts of treason. This letter was written by Hugh Parker, Esq. the senior magistrate of the district, who, by return of post, received an answer from Lord Sidmouth, informing him that the person he described as so dangerous a character was an *Agent of Government !!!* Indignant at this communication, Mr. Parker's first determination was to withdraw his name from the commission of the peace, but his repugnance to shrink from his duty at time of public exigency overcame his detestation of the system which ministers had adopted, and he was prevailed upon to continue those services which have reflected so much honour on his own character, and so much benefit on the country. When Lord Sidmouth's *long promised* statement regarding the employment given by government to a herd of spies and informers makes its appearance, we hope he will indulge the public with the correspondence which passed between his lordship and the Sheffield magistracy. We should be glad too if the Magistrates would publish the examinations taken before the Lord-Lieutenant at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th. ult. If we are rightly informed, those examinations confirm every material point of the statement regarding Mr. Oliver, made in this paper two days before; and it has been stated distinctly in the House of Commons, that the *only material called for the crown* on that occasion, swore that Mr. Oliver got up, or prepared the whole plot. We beg to direct the attention of our readers to the speech of Mr Bennett on the third reading of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and we should be glad if some Member of the House would move, in his place, for the production of Bradley's evidence.

On this subject Lord Castlereagh has dauntlessly declared that government do employ spies, and has represented them as necessary to the safety of the state. Under an administration such as that formed by his lordship and his co-adjutors this may be the case, but *good* ministers, like *good* princes, require no spies, and the words of Montesquieu, whose skill in the science of politics would not suffer by a comparison with any of the present ministers individually, or with the whole of them collectively, has said:— " Should I be asked whether there is any necessity for spies in monarchies, my answer would be, that the usual practice of good princes is not to employ them. The trade of a spy might perhaps be tolerable were it practised by honest men, but the *necessary* infamy of the person is sufficient to make us judge of the infamy of the thing."

It has been insinuated, that in making the exposure we have exhibited to the public, we have been influenced by factious motives, and that our object has been merely to annoy the servants of the Crown, and to advance the interests of a party. Supposing this to be the case, the motives would not disprove the facts. But we claim the merit of higher influence. That we have our party predilections we are free to confess, but we have much more regard for our country than for our party. It has been stated that we are ultra-reformers, or as the phrase in the *Sun** Newspaper is " reformers of the modern school." This assertion we deny, and we appeal to facts for the veracity of our disclaimer. It is known by every man who has read our sentiments on Parliamentary Reform, as published in this paper, that without presuming to condemn the advocates of universal suffrage and annual parliaments, we have never been the supporter of those measures. It is known too, that at the meeting held in this town for the purpose of voting a Petition to the Legislature on the subject of Parliamentary Reform, we stedfastly and successfully opposed the introduction of a motion for assembling adjourned meetings, maintaining that they had the appearance of holding out a menace to government. It is also known, that when the practice prevailed last year of sending out political missionaries, for the purpose of inculcating the principles of Parliamentary Reform, we openly and perseveringly condemned the policy, and exposed the impropriety of such a proceeding, and it was probably owing to this cause that we never had the honour of a call from MR. OLIVER. It is further known, that we supported to the best of our power the benevolent views of those who, during the past year of general distress, exerted themselves to relieve the labouring classes by providing them food at a reasonable price; and that we pointedly condemned the censure cast upon institutions established for that purpose; but it, is not known, perhaps, though it is nevertheless true,that we never were connected at any time with any political society whatever. In making these statements, we must repeat that we are not to be understood as conveying any censure towards. those who have pursued a different course on any or all the points we have mentioned ; we merely state the facts to show that we are neither ultra-reformers nor the slaves of any party. On every subject we act on the decision of our own unbiased opinion, honestly formed, and we claim therefore the credit of having made the exposure of MR. OLIVER, and the spy system, purely on public and patriotic grounds.

We have the satisfaction to conclude this article, by stating a fact, that will be hailed with pleasure by every real friend to social order: Since Mr. Oliver left Yorkshire, perfect tranquility has been restored. The County was never more peaceable. The 13th light dragoons, who had been brought into the West Riding, under an apprehension of an insurrectionary rising, have returned to their quarters at York, and the nightly military patrole has been discontinued. In a word, we are as tranquil now the spies have disappeared, as we were before they came amongst us. The exciting cause has been withdrawn, and the effect has ceased.

ORIGIN OF THE LATE CONSPIRACIES.

Several attempts have been made, both in and out of Parliament, to prove that Mr Oliver was merely a *passive* agent in the late conspiracies, formed against Government in the North of England; and that he neither excited the popular discontent, nor gave vitality and organization to the conspiracies. — That this representation of the conduct of the "ministerial agent" is false and deceptive, we have already proved by a host of witnesses. But it is said that these witnesses have all acted under the influence of a disposition to traduce the character of Mr. Legh Keck's *immaculate builder*, and that therefore their evidence is not to be relied upon. This conclusion, we think, does not arise by any means out of the premises. There may, however, be those who are of a different opinion, and to such we beg leave to shoW, out of the mouth of a *Government witness*, that Mr. Oliver was the "Great Man";— that under his directions the *delegates*, so called, were appointed— that he moved and controlled every thing, and that he was, in a word, "the foreman of the concern."

At the examination held at Wakefield on Monday, the 16th of June, before the Lord-Lieutenant, and a full bench of Magistrates, to inquire into the conduct of the ten prisoners apprehended at Thornhill-Lees on Friday, the 6th ult. on a charge of holding a treasonable meeting, a witness, whose name we are not at liberty to mention, was produced for the Crown, and against the prisoners. This witness, who was represented by the accusers to be of unimpeached character, and free from all suspicion, deposed, amongst other matters:—

"That he had seen Oliver twice. That he, Oliver, was considered by all the parties as the *great man* to communicate and direct things from London. That as *he* directed so *they* acted. That the appointment of the delegates was subject to Mr. Oliver's approval, and that on one occasion he objected to a delegate alleging that he was an improper person, because he thought he would tell tales. Mitchrll preceded Oliver and introduced him. This deponent was a delegate himself, and was appointed by a person *who received his instructions from Mr. Oliver*. He believes all the delegates were appointed as he was. The deponent stated, that ten men met at Thornhill Lees ; Mr. Oliver was in the lane near the house. He knows that the delegates must have been approved by Oliver ; he knows it for a certainty, because Oliver did actually reject one of them. The witness *considered Oliver to be the foreman of the concern*. This witness, who had turned an informer, was taken to Thornhill Lees to identify the delegates, and it was at his suggestion that Oliver was seized, but he, (Oliver), was almost immediately afterwards set at liberty by a person in authority, who said— "he must be liberated, he is the Government spy, or agent, or words to that effect."

For the accuracy of this portion of the evidence, we appeal to the Magistrates present at the examination, and we beg again to press upon their consideration the propriety of laying the whole of the depositions taken on that occasion before the public. If our frequent calls for the details of the proceedings at Wakefield, on the 16th inst. and for the long-promised statement of Lord Sidmouth in justification of the system of *espionage*, has the appearance of pertinacity, we have no other apology to offer for our perseverance than that which arises out of a deep anxiety for the establishment of truth, and a sincere wish to rescue our countrymen from the stigma which has been cast upon their character, it order to find a pretence for suspending their liberties.

[--break--]

On Wednesday se'nniight, two persons, who we understand were a king's messenger and a Bow-street officer, arrived at Wakefield, and arrested Benjamin Scholes, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State, and immediately took him away for London. They starched his house and examined his papers, but did not carry one away with them. This was all done with such secrecy, that the fact was not known beyond the circuit of his family till Friday noon. — *Wakefield Star*

*Charges of Treasonable Practices.*— On Thursday night, a man of the name of Scholes, was brought to London by a King's Messenger and a Bow-street officer, from Wakefield. On Friday Scholes underwent an examination at the Secretary of State's Office for the Home Department, before Lord Sidmouth, the Law Officers, Sir N. Conant, &c. At the same time several others, who had been in custody for some time, were brought from the House of Correction, and underwent an examination. After which Scholes was sent off to Cambridge prison.— On Saturday night, between nine and ten o clock, a King's Messenger and a Bow-Street Officer arrived in town with another man in custody, on a charge of Treasonable Practices, by virtue of a warrant issued against him, signed by Lord Viscount Sidmouth, as Secretary of State. On account of the lateness of the hour, no person was in attendance at the Secretary of State's Office, and no Magistrate being sitting, he was lodged in the House of Correction.

William Wheatley, who was brought to London on Saturday night, was on Monday removed from the House of Correction to the Secretary of State's Office for the Home Department, where he underwent an examination before Lord Viscount Sidmouth, the Law Officers, Sir N. Conant, &c. He was afterwards remanded. The Messenger and Officer brought him from Huddersfield, in Yorkshire.

*Oliver the Spy.*— This fellow, whom no invitation seems likely to drag from his hiding place, is said to be a native of Wales, and a carpenter by trade. He was last summer a prisoner in the Fleet, where he would have been starved, had it not been for some friends to reform— of whom he pretended to be one of the most zealous. He is also a freemason, (but we hope, will not long remain so,) and secretary to the Royal Public Lodge. No. 100, held at Mr. Murphey's, the Golden Hind, little Moorfields. He is a tall good-looking man, near six feet in height, and inclined to be corpulent. He was a few years ago a serjeant in the grenadier company of the Whitechapel volunteers.— *Liverpool Mercury*.

...

Since our last, were committed to York Castle, ... - Also, Thomas Riley, of Crosland Moor tailor, charged upon the oath of one credible witness, with being accessory before the fact, and procuring, counselling, commanding, or abetting others to bring about and commit certain riots, unlawful assemblies, and felonies, at the parishes of Kirkburton, Almondbury and Huddersfield, or one of them, and which riots, unlawful assemblies, and felonies, took place on the night of the 8th of June last.-Also, Benjamin Green, of Honley, cloth dresser, charged upon the oath of Joshua Kemp, with being present and aiding and assisting in a riot and unlawful assembly, at the township of Honley on Saturday, the 8th of June last, and tumultuously going about, and unlawfully and feloniosly demanding, stealing, taking and carrying away certain fire arms, from the dwelling-houses of Sarah Jessop and others, in Honley aforesaid. Also, Joseph Jysop, of Lockwood, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Charles Earnsbaw, with being present and aiding and assisting in a riot and unlawful assembly, and bearing arms, at a place called Folly Hall Bridge, in Huddersfield on the night of Sunday the 8th June last, to the terror of the people, and along with others unknown, and with intent to have done some of his Majesty's liege subjects some grievous bodily harm.

THE HUDDERSFIELD INSURRECTION

An inflated and highly exaggerated account of the state of the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield, during the past month, has been published in the Leeds Intelligencer, and copied into the London Ministerial papers. Such a publication, on the eve of the trial at York, we hold to be extremely reprehensible, and must, as far as it is believed, have a tendency to prejudice the minds of the jury appointed to sit in judgement upon the lives of the accused. To assert in a public print before the trials come on, and of course on *ex parte* evidence, that the object of the prisoners was " massacre," and that their plans were to be consummated by " plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent," is to prejudge their cause, and to deprive these unfortunate men of the benefit of that salutary maxim of the English law, which holds every man to be innocent till a jury of his countrymen has pronounced him guilty. Without pretending to be at all in the secrets of the insurgents, we must say, we have too favourable an opinion of our species and of our countrymen, to believe that any numerous body of them in a particular neighbourhood, could be brought to be the actors in a sedition, that was to inflict " massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage," upon their neighbours, " to a fearful extent." The intention of the insurgents, as far as we can learn, was to effect a " bloodless revolution," and the purpose of seizing and *disarming* the military, as stated is the account before us, seems to favour that supposition. That a bloodless revolution could have been effected, is, to be sure, a supposition too gross to be entertained by any set of men of common understanding ; but Mr. Oliver, it seems, had the address to persuade the leaders that a project of this kind was practicable, and his dupes were so utterly ignorant as to adopt the absurdity. This fact may serve to shew of what kind of materials the Huddersfield branch of the conspiracy was formed. How many men and boys (for there was, it seems, a considerable proportion of the latter) assembled at *Folly*-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th, we cannot learn with any degree of certainty, but some estimate may be formed of their strength from the fact, that a detachment of newly-raised Yeomanry Cavalry put to flight and entirely dispersed the insurgent army ! while the only blood that flowed on the occasion on either side, was the blood of a horse, and the only other mark of violence inflicted was, as the Intelligencer states, the mark of a bail which struck a deserted house ! We do not wish to speak with levity of a proceeding which every friend to his country must condemn, but when we see a local act of popular violence, exaggerated to the bulk of a wide spreading insurrection, we feel it to be our duty to remove the deception, by lowering down the colouring to the standard of truth.

We have hitherto cautiously abstained from entering into the details of the violent proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield on the night of the 8th of June, satisfying ourselves with stating from time to time the committals of the prisoners to the County gaol ; and this course we should have pursued, leaving the facts to be developed upon the trials, had not the exaggerated statements made in the Intelligencer induced us to depart from that determination. It now, however, becomes proper to state, that ever since the year 1812, when the Luddite system prevailed in Yorkshire, and raged more especially in the South-western plots of this Riding, there has been considerable irritation existing in the minds of some of the lower classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. This disposition, the extreme distress suffered by the labouring part of the community during the past year, tended materially to increase. For a time, the hope of Parliamentary Reform allayed the public dissatisfaction, by affording some prospect of relief, and petitions for that purpose were drawn up and signed very generally; but no sooner was the Bill for the suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act passed into a law, then hope gave place to despair; and soon after, a number of designing men, seizing the opportunity, did not hesitate to inculcate the opinion, that nothing short of a revolution could terminate the general suffering. Of these pestilent characters, the notorious Mr. Oliver was one of the principal ; and we have the authority of the wife of one of the persons mentioned in the Intelligencer as a principal conspirator (George Dawson), delivered in the presence of three respectable witnesses, for saying that as long since as nearly two months ago, Oliver was in communication with the ring-leaders of the sedition, and that on one occasion he was a visitor at Dawson's house. On the same authority we state, that Mr. Oliver had held conferences with George Taylor, the leader of the mal-content forces, on the night of the 8th of June, and it is known that both Dawson and Taylor have since absconded. How Oliver conducted himself in his visits to Huddersfield, may be collected from the testimony of Dawson's wife, who says, that one morning, while she was at breakfast at Dawson's house, Oliver, among other inflammatory conversation, said -" They are all in readiness, in London. There is no occasion for bloodshed. We have only to seize the military and disarm them, and the thing is done." He added, that he had been concerned with Despard ;  that just before the Colonel and his associates were apprehended, he was going into a private room with them, but recollecting that he had a little business of his own to transact, he stepped out. and had not been gone half an hour, before they were all taken.

Under this kind of excitation, it is no wonder that the persons to whom such conversation was addressed, began to form traitorous designs, or rather perhaps, to cherish hopes that designs already formed might be realized. The leaders, it appears, held frequent communications with the subordinate agents. The plot thickened daily. A considerable number of men in the lowest ranks of life became involved in the conspiracy. Sunday night, the 8th of June, was appointed for the rising. Two or three hundred persons, it is said, many of them boys from 14 to 20 years, assembled at a place bearing the appropriate name of *Folly*-hall-bridge. Taylor placed himself at their head, and at 12 o'clock, the moment for commencing operations, this fanatic addressed his followers in these terms " Now, my lads, all England is in arms-our liberties are secure— the rich will be poor, and the poor will be rich." To this rabble a detachment of six Yeomanry Cavalry was at first opposed, and we verily believe that had the cavalry , small as their number were, thought proper to advance, they would have routed the insurgents, They however judged it prudent to retreat, and being reinforced by a body of their comrades, they returned to witness the dispersion of an unorganized mob that had been drawn together, some by actual force, others by an idle curiosity, and others, no doubt, with criminal designs. In the mean time, a sort of under-plot was acting, and a number of marauders were passing about the neighbourhood, forcing the peaceable inhabitants to open their doors and surrender their fire-arms. At Honley, they broke into the house of Mr. Armitage, who observed that one of the bandits seemed better dressed than his associates, " that he was not like one of this country-men, and that he talked like a Londoner." 

The Magistrates, who appear to have displayed a more than ordinary share of vigour, soon found means to discover and to arrest a number of the persons engaged in these criminal excesses, and twenty-four of them have been committed to York Castle, to take their trials at the Assizes, which commence this day, while about half that number still remain in confinement in the prison at Huddersfield. It is much to be regretted that the persons apprehended, and about to be put upon their trials, have for the most part, been, at most, merely the dupes of the leaders of this miserable conspiracy, and that the instigators, including Mr. Oliver, the London delegate, have been suffered to escape.

*Mr. Oliver's Cyper.*—  It appears from the evidence of the principal witness for the Crown given before the Lord Lieutenant and the Magistrates at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th of June, that Mr. Oliver corresponded with his dupes in cypher, and that one of the mottos used by him for that purpose was—  *"The Old Mother is sick, and expects all her sons to arm."*

MINISTERIAL JUSTIFICATION OF OLIVER

*(From the Times)*

In the House of Commons on Friday, in a debate on the State of the Nation, Mr. H Addington said, he had risen principally with a view of doing justice to a much injured individual—he meant Mr. Oliver. (*hear, hear*.) Within this fortnight two magistrates within the county of York, who had received an unfavourable impression as to the conduct of Mr. Oliver in the country, had requested that he might undergo an examination at the office for the Home Department. One of these magistrates came from Yorkshire on purpose. and the other was a much respected member of that House, whose absence he regretted, as that gentleman would have corroborated the statement he had to make. These magistrates took the examination ; the individual who brought the charge was confronted with Mr. Oliver, and the result was, that both magistrates declared themselves completely satisfied that the charge was false. that there was not indeed the smallest foundation for supposing that he had provoked the insurrection in the country; and that there had been nothing blameable either in the language or conduct of the person thus accused. It was his duty to make this statement, because the facts could only be made known to the house through him. Mr. Oliver had taken no part in any plots. He came to the Home-office in the beginning of April, and offered information which he considered beneficial to the country, but which he had not obtained by being implicated in any conspiracy. He asked no reward, and never received a shilling from Government, except what served to defray his travelling expenses. Information had been transmitted to the Home-office, that the insurrection which had been attempted was to break out on the 9th or 10th of June. All the magistrates in the disturbed districts. who had written on the subject, agreed in fixing upon the same date. The duty required of Mr. Oliver was to go to the country to ascertain whether this report was correct, and to transmit to the Home-office what information he might collect. This, it was supposed, would save time to the magistrates and the information, it was thought, would be more speedily collected than by relying solely on the separate communications of the magistrates. He carried letters of recommendation to five or six magistrates, and was ordered to return by the 5th of June, as by that time it was necessary that the Executive Government should be prepared with the precautions against the imminent danger which threatened the peace of the country. Mr. Oliver, however, stayed by accident a day or two beyond the limited time; and he had himself written a letter to hasten his return. When Mr. Oliver came to the office and offered to give evidence, he declared he did so in the hope of saving the country; and he was fully persuaded of his sincerity.

*Mr. Barham* doubted much whether the country, or even that House, would concur in the judgement of acquittal which the secret tribunal to which the Right Hon. Gent. referred had pronounced on the spy Oliver. Those who had not the advantage of having been present at the secret tribunal, must decide on the facts already within their knowledge. For his part, he should declare that his judgment could not be on the favourable side, when he recollected what he had heard from a departed Right Honourable friend of his, whose memory had been so justly eulogized that night. Mr. Ponsonby (who it will be recollected was a member of the Secret Committee) had told him, that he believed, in his conscience, the insurrection would not have taken place had it not been for Oliver. He had been so struck with this observation, that he asked his Right Hon. Friend to repeat what he had stated, and he did repeat it.

*Frame-breaking*.-The *Gazette* of Tuesday night contains the Proclamation of the Prince Regent, offering an amnesty to the persons concerned in the offence of frame-breaking, except in the case of the outrage at Loughborough; the intention of issuing which was announced by Lord Sidmouth on the discussion of the Frame-breaking Bill in the House of Lords. After alluding to the increase of punishment annexed to this offence by the Act recently passed, and expressing a hope that persons will thus be deterred from the future commission of such offences, the Proclamation proceeds—

" We do hereby promise and declare, that every person who hath committed any offence against the form of the Statute made in the fifty-fourth year of his Majesty's reign, for the punishment of persons destroying stocking or lace-frames, but hath not yet been charge therewith, and who shall, previous to the first day of September next ensuing, appear before some Justice of the Peace or Magistrate and declare such his offence, and when, where, and by whom the same was committed, shall receive his Majesty's most gracious pardon for such offence, and that no confession so made by any such person shall be given in evidence in any Court, or in any case whatever; provided nevertheless, that nothing herein contained shall extend to the offence so committed at Loughborough as afore said, nor to any other offence, except such as may have been committed contrary to the said Statute made in the fifty-fourth year aforesaid."

TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS.

In reference to the Trials the Yorkshire Rioters, published in our last paper, the Leeds' Mercury contains, among other matter, the following remarks:—

" The trials of the State prisoners, as they have been pompously called, closed at York last Saturday; and the four-and-twenty persons against whom the Government solicitor was instructed to institute prosecutions, ten have been pronounced not guilty; against eleven others no bills were found ; and one has been liberated on bail; leaving only two in the whole number in Confinement, and those two unfortunate men have been detained, without trial, by a Secretary State's warrant, under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Thus ends the Yorkshire plot!

" The failure of these prosecutions has not been owing to any want of zeal, or deficiency of means, on the part of the Government.

" While we speak of the *zeal* manifested by the persons officially engaged in the trials of the prisoners, we cannot but regret that the Judge should have had occasion complain, in the presence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Haigh, the committing magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the magistrates required, till had made particular inquiry for them. The upright mind of Baron Wood, it was evident, felt wounded by this proceeding, and any thing like reluctance to give to the accused all the advantages any discrepancy between the original examination of a witness and his evidence before the Court, will always be viewed with suspicion by a people jealous of their privileges, and anxious in the highest degree to preserve the stream of public justice free from contamination. The apology made for this suspicious omission by Mr. Le Blanc, the solicitor for the Crown, must be felt by every lover of justice to be extremely unsatisfactory. Some of the examinations, he says, were not taken on oath : but that surely is no reason why the others should be withheld !—and why, we should be glad to know, were examinations involving the liberty and lives of many of our countrymen not taken in the usual and authorised way ? Mr. Allison, the clerk to the Huddersfield magistrates, and the professional coadjutor of the Crown solicitor in these prosecutions, might have instructed Mr. Allen's inexperience. Though his modesty may not allow it, the people of Huddersfield, and the professional gentlemen of the county of York, well know that there are few gentlemen in their profession better acquainted with the duties of a magistrate's law-clerk, or who has had more experience in criminal matters, than Mr. Allison. If our memory does not fail us, this gentleman acted as law-clerk to Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Radcliffe, during the whole of the disturbances in 1812, when no fewer than 64 persons were committed to York-castle, and when 17 of that number were capitally convicted. Inexperience, therefore, is out of the question ; but supposing this to have been the case, the public will naturally inquire, whether Mr. Le Blanc is also inexperienced? and why he who had the chief direction of the prosecution did not order the depositions to be laid before the Judge ? These documents were, however tardily, at length produced, and the penetrating eye of Baron Wood soon discovered that Samuel Winpenny had sworn one thing before the magistrates, and another before the Court; and this contradiction on a point of essential importance was very properly deemed by his Lordship fatal to the Witness's testimony.

" We have been led into these observations by a circumstance of a  very extraordinary nature that has come to our knowledge, and which bears a striking affinity the case of McKinle, so recently before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh : but before we proceed to state the facts to which we allude, it may be proper, for the perfect understanding of the subject, to quote the words of Baron Wood, in his charge to the Jury, on the trial of Benjamin Lockwood and others, for maliciously, shooting at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield yeomanry cavalry, on the night the 8th of June.  After adverting to the testimony George Armytage, one of the witnesses for the Crown, who had sworn that he and a person of the name of Earnshaw, or Hearnshaw, had been forced to join the rioters at Folly-hall-bridge, his Lordship said—— " There is another circumstance deserving the serious consideration of the jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness. He has been in the custody of the prosecutors; he is now at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present, and to have seen all the circumstances that Armytage has asserted in evidence; and yet he is not produced! The Jury will draw their own inferences from this strong fact. It was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness."

" Upon this text of Mr. Baron Wood, the following declaration of Charles Hearnshaw, the witness referred to, furnishes the alarming comment: we publish the document, *verbatim*, as it has been sent to us, [with the exception of one word used sportively by the Grand Jury], chusing rather to retain even the grammatical inaccuracies, than to make any alterations in the paper itself:—

" DECLARATION CHARLES HEARNSHAW.

"Transmitted for publication form Huddersfield, o  
"Thursday, the 31st of July, 1817.

"I was examined, the 21st of June, by Mr. B. Allen, Magistrate, concerning the Folly-hall fight:— He asked if I could tell him who fir'd first? I told him the cavalry fir'd first, at the Folly Hall Bridge, on the 8th of June. Mr. Allen told me I was mistaken, it was a gun in Manchester-street that I heard. I told him it was not a gun  Manchester-street, it was the gentlemen cavalry : I was certain of it: but they would not put that in my examination. When I was going to be examined by the grand jury, at York, Mr. Thomas Atkinson came to me, and asked me, if would do him a favour ? I asked him what it was ? He said, he could wish me to say the mob fir'd first and bought a shilling's worth of oranges ; and he told me if did not say the mob fired first, I should have four or five evidences against me, namely, Mr. T. Atkinson, Mr. David Alexander, Mr. Allen the magistrate, and George Whitehead the constable. I told the grand jury the truth; I told them the cavalry fired first, and I told them the ball wiz'd close by my head.—They asked me if I was not afraid: I told them I was not. I told them, then, there was about eight or nine of the mob fired, and immediately the cavalry galloped off. The Grand Jury said, they was——, and laugh'd. Saturday, the 26th, a gentleman from London sent for me, Mr. Liblong, Solicitor for the Crown, I think they call'd him, and he asked me what I meant to say when I got into the Court ? I told him I meant to speak the truth; I told him I meant to say that the cavalry fir'd first. He told me I was a damned lieing rascal, and said I had had conversation with Buckley, and he had persuaded me to say so. He asked me if I could not as well say the mob fir'd first, say the cavalry fir'd first. Mr. Atkinson likewise told me Buckley had been talking to me, and had persuaded me to say the cavalry fir'd first; and, because I would not say as they wanted, I was never brought up to give my evidence in the Court; and when I made application to Mr. Allinson, the attorney, for something to carry me home, he said he had orders to give me nothing; and Matthew Bradley, clerk to Mr. Allen, said I should be pillor'd, before the 3 months' end, if I did not mind what I was about. And this is the real truth ; I am ready to attest it before any man in England. CHARLES HEARNSHAW."

This same writer also says, that if nothing came out about Oliver on the trials, it was not for want proof that he had meddled: " had it been necessary to prove that this spy had been in communication with the leaders of the sedition, and that he had 'aided, counselled, and comforted' them, that evidence was at hand." This, however, rests on the Editor of the Mercury's *ipse dixit*: we copy the following extracts from another Leeds paper which will soon show how much his statement is to be depended upon.

"*To the Editor of the, Leeds Intelligencer.*

Sir, —From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the *Leeds  Mercury*, ofSaturday, August 2nd, I think myself called upon to DENY, MOST POSITIVELY, that any Conversation passed, in my Presence, of the Nature alluded to in the Declaration signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW." Your Insertion of this, in your *Intelligencer*, will much oblige. Sir, Your obedient Servant, B. HAIGH ALLEN.  
" Greenhead, 2nd August, 1817."

"We were so much occupied with the details of the late important trials of the Huddersfield rioters, that we had not room, in our last, for remarks. They furnish, however, independently of the villainious attempts which have in consequence been made to attach the vilest imputation's upon the Magistracy and others who were active in bringing the insurgents to trial, abundant matter for serious reflection, and for the exercise of the strictest vigilance, in guarding against the future designs of the disaffected in that and other quarters. What we are about to state is of the deepest importance; and though it is difficult to restrain the boiling indignation occasioned by the ceaseless perversions of an unprincipled and seditious press, we shall endeavour to treat the subject with that temper and moderation which its solemn importance demands. From motives of the purest delicacy, and of respect for the upright and learned Judge who presided at these trials, we intended to have carefully abstained from all notice of fatal misunderstanding, under which he laboured respecting the *examinations* of some of the witnesses, taken in the earlier stages of the proceedings, by the Committing Magistrates. And the *friends* of the prisoners, we should have imagined, resting satisfied with the verdict of their acquittal, would have been more anxious to enjoy that *triumph* in silent satisfaction, than to recur for the insolent purpose of insulting the Magistracy and the Government, to that slippery ground from which the prisoners made, in the words of the Judge, so "*narrow an escape*" with whole necks. As they have, however, affected, in the midst of their real joy,  " regret that the Judge had occasion to complain, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the Magistrates required, till he had made particular inquiry for them,"—we feel ourselves bound to complete the history of that unfortunate misunderstanding, *part of which*, and the most important part, has been *wilfully suppressed*, by the individuals who have been so imprudent as to bring all before the public. The Judge then, not only *complained*, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates ; he distinctly imputed to them, not only in their own presence, but in that of the Jury, and in open Court, IMPROPER MOTIVES, and an ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE THE JUDGE! We know not what were the feelings of the active and honourable Magistrates at that moment. Those of our Reporter trembled for them, and for the character of the Magisterial jurisprudence of the country. But his fears were instantly dissipated by the open and prompt conduct of the Magistrates. The parties who have brought this circumstance before the public well know (for they were present in Court during the time) that the Committing Magistrates immediately offered to give explanations ON OATH, which would have satisfactorily accounted not only for any apparent irregularity in the production of the examinations, but would have also accounted for the seeming "discrepancy" between the examinations and the evidence. One of the Magistrates Mr. Allen, was actually sworn, and was about to reply to some interrogatories of the Counsel,—when— *The Judge PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO HEAR HIM!* In laying this important fact before the public we repeat that we have not the intention of imputing the slightest blame to the learned Judge, who, we firmly believe, being under a misunderstanding, did that, and that only, which his conscience, and a high sense of his duty, dictated. Though it is our opinion, therefore, that his refusal to hear the Magistrates had a fatal effect upon the prosecution, we submitted in respectful silence to the verdict, rather than the conscientious conduct of a Judge and Jury should be called in question. With an indecent and imprudent eagerness, however, the occurrence has been dragged, in partial and distorted shape, before the public, by those who ought to been for ever silent on the circumstances of the late trials, from which their friends made so narrow an escape; and we can have no hesitation in saying that *their* motives, in concealing the fact that the offer of the Magistrates to explain was rejected, are base and designing and wicked, as has been their whole conduct, first in inciting the deluded classes of the people to outrage, and afterwards in labouring incessantly to forward their projects by active assistance; by denying the existence of those projects while denial was possible and by palliating them when they could no longer be concealed.

" Thus far from our own knowledge. We have authority, upon which we can rely, for stating further that the Judge (too late, unfortunately, for public justice) was, after the trial, satisfied that he had been mistaken and SENT AN APOLOGY TO MR. ALLEN, *one of the Committing Magistrates*, for the expressions he had used. The mistake was perhaps natural, and was at all events on the side of mercy, as was another error into which he fell with respect to the testimony, on a material point, of the witness Winpenny. In spite of the assurances of the Counsel for the prosecution, his Lordship persisted in this mistake, till Mr. Gurney handed him sn extract of the evidence, *verbatim*, from his notes.

" The infamous trumped up paper, published in the last Mercury, and entitled the "*Declaration of Charles Hearnshaw*" in which Mr. Allen, Mr. Thomas Atkinson, and Mr. Le Blanc, are most foully and libellously charged with having endeavoured to bribe or threaten Hearnshaw to give false evidence, and with having actually falsified his deposition, we pronounce at once to be entirely destitute of truth. So far as Mr. Allen is concerned, we already present the Public (see his letter above) with that Gentleman's unqualified contradiction. And, if the other parties libelled do not in the mean time determine on vindicating their names in another place, we shall be prepared with the proofs of their honour also in our next. We happened to learn, on the very day of the trial, the real reason that Hearnshaw was not called to give his evidence. It was ascertained that he had been closetted, for a considerable time, with one of the gentlemen employed for the prisoners ; and his *Declaration* proves not only how aptly he had imbibed his lesson, but how accurately the Counsel for the Crown had calculated the effect of the conference, when they declined to place him in the witness box.—This fellow's Declaration, y-the-bye, except that he *now* maintains the cavalry fired first, and not the insurgents, goes only to prove the main facts of the outrage, and that he himself was present, thus *confirming*, the Reader will not fail to observe, *the evidence of George Armitage*. That the insurgents fired first, is indisputably established, by the unquestionable and positive testimony of Capt. Armytage and Mr. Alexander, as well as by that of Mr. Whitehead the Constable, and of George Armitage. IF the Leeds Mercury, therefore, in his eagerness to fabricate falsehood, and to give currency to every falsehood which is generated in the lowest dregs of his party, had not been blinded to all perception of truth, as well as dead to all sense of shame, he might have discovered, at a glance, before he so grossly committed himself, and so flagrantly abused the liberty of the press, by publishing so atrocious a libel, that Hearnshaw's story contains internal evidence of utter falsehood,— the principal drift of it being, (next to that of libelling the parties named in it,) to make it appear that the first shot was fired by the *cavalry*, though the contrary has been irrefragably established.

" Just as our Paper was going to Press, we received the following Communication from Mr. Atkinson, of Colne Bridge, addressed

"*To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury.*  
Sir—I have seen a  Declaration, in your Paper of this Day, signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW," which I should deem unworthy of Notice, but from your insinuation that I had tampered with him.—I feel it a Duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make Oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate; and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least Insinuation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any "Favour" of, or "tampered" with him in any way.I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my Examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry had fired first, and I then observed, that he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he.

We should not enter into this discussion did we not observe that there are Editors in this part of the country who copy all charges similar to those contained in the Leeds Mercury, without laying before their readers a single line in the way of explanation, tho' well aware of the existence of such matter. And yet these are the exclusive truth-tellers !

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 09 August 1817

THE PROSECUTION OF THE HUDDERSFIELD RIOTERS AND THEIR WITNESSES

IN another part of our publication of this day, will be found a letter from MR. R. HAIGH ALLEN, Esq. one of the Huddersfield Magistrates, denying, in positive terms, that any conversation of the nature referred to in CHARLES HEARNSHAW's Declaration, inserted in our last week's paper, took place in his presence. This disclaimer of  Mr. ALLEN is followed by a letter from Mr. THOMAS ATKINSON, in which he asserts that he asked no *favour* of CHARLES HEARNSHAW as stated in his Declaration, but admits that he had a conversation with him in the anti-room, previous to the examination of Hearnshaw before the Grand Jury, and that he combated the evidence which Hearnshaw stated that it was his intention to give, respecting the first fire at Folly-hall- Bridge, on the night of the 8th of June, and endeavoured to influence his mind contrary to the witness's avowed impressions of the facts to which he was about to swear. Mr. Atkinson adds, that he did indeed give Armitage and Hearnshaw a shilling's worth of oranges, because they had been so long detained from their dinner,—but that this " bribe," as Mr. Atkinson calls it, was given in the most public manner.

Upon the appearance of these counter-statements, we felt it to be our duty to write to a tradesman in Huddersfield, requesting that he would see Hearnshaw, the declarant, and inquire into the truth of his Declaration; adding, that if he had, either from design or inadvertency, stated any thing that was false, to the disadvantage of Mr. Allen or Mr. Atkinson, or any of the other persons mentioned in his publication, it was as much his duty to make a public retraction of those statements, (if erroneous) as it was to persist in them if true. In reply to this letter, Hearnshaw himself came over to Leeds, and waited upon the Printer of this Paper, when he re-asserted, in the presence of a gentleman of the town, all the facts he had stated in his Declaration, and added, that he was ready to verify them, upon oath, before any Magistrate in the kingdom.

It is no part of our duty to reconcile the conflicting testimony of Mr. Allen and Mr. Thomas Atkinson with that of Charles Hearnshaw. They are, indeed, irreconcileable. It is assertion against assertion. We have merely inserted the papers as they have reached us, without feeling either responsibility or anxiety about the truth of any of them. The conflict, it will be observed, is between the parties in the prosecution and one of their principal witnesses, and it is impossible to imagine any thing that could be more gratifying to the feelings of the State prisoners, so lately acquitted or discharged, for want of evidence to put them upon their trial, than to find the committing Magistrate and one of the witnesses, on whose testimony they were committed to York Castle, impeaching each other's veracity. The prosecutors, in these State trials, are, to be sure, placed in a most curious predicament, with respect to their witnesses —those they did produce the Court would not believe, and those they did not produce they will not believe themselves !

There is, however, one part of Hearnshaw's evidence, and that the most material part of it, which stands uncontradicted, and which, we understand, is unquestionable, namely, that he was examined before the Grand Jury, and that, because his testimony did not square with the wishes of the prosecutors for conviction, he was not produced on the trial, though as the learned Judge observed, " it was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness." BARON WOOD added, that the Jury would draw their own inferences from this strong fact.

The characteristic feature of these prosecutions was *suppression*. In the first place, the depositions of the witnesses, taken by the committing magistrates, were withheld, contrary to the usual practice, till the Judge made particular inquiries for them :— in the second, the evidence of a principal witness was suppressed, though he had been kept a month in confinement in order to be prepared to give that evidence :— and, in the third and last place, if we are rightly informed. the depositions taken before the Magistrates at Wakefield, during their inquiry into this business, on the 9th of June, though containing, we have reason to believe, important matter to the prisoners, was also suppressed. In the emphatic words of BARON WOOD, the public " will draw their own inferences" from these "strong facts."

POSTSCRIPT

...

It is a fact deserving of observation, that in both the reports of the trial of the persons charged with stealing arms and with tumultuous proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, inserted in the Intelligencer, the editor of that paper *suppressed* the Judge's charges *in toto*. But in order to compensate his readers for the omission, he has presented them this week with a *proscription* list, and has actually had the extreme folly to hold up certain Gentlemen by name as the intended objects of assassination. For ourselves we believe this list to be the fabrication of some Government informer, with whom probably this Government scribe is in communication. As nothing came out upon the trial respecting the announced "massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage to fearful extent," we are told that this exposure is reserved till a future period, and that *when* the trials of the persons sent to York Castle and detained on a charge of high treason come on, *then* the whole of these horrors will appear. This is probably true; *when* those trials do come on, strange sights will be seen. If we recollect right, the public were assured, on precisely the same authority as that on which the proscription list rests, that at the assizes which have just passed, a number of the prisoners were to be tried for *high treason*, but this proved to be "an unaccountable mistake!" This renowned proscription will, we have no doubt, prove to be "an unaccountable mistake" also, and we hope the proscribed and her families will have too much good sense to make themselves uneasy about the danger of the assassin, which we believe, like Macbeth's dagger, is purely *aerial*— "a dagger of the mind."

In reading the *Intelligencer* of the present week, one is puzzled to discover whether Baron Wood or the Printer of the Leeds Mercury is most to *blame* for the acquittal of the State prisoners at York, and for the *fatal* consequences of that acquittal, though we think, on the whole, the Judge has it. If, however, the very *impartial* Editor has been a little too severe upon the judge and upon the Printer, he has been sufficiently indulgent towards the prosecutors, for he has very obligingly forborne from saying a single word in condemnation of those omissions and commissions at which the humane feelings of the whole Court were revolted. Upon the prisoners he bears unmercifully, directing his condemnation indiscriminately against those who were acquitted, and those who, after having been immured in prison for several weeks, were sent home, because there was not sufficient evidence even to put them upon their trials. They, poor souls, have nothing to give, but the Magistrates and the yeomanry, who have favours to bestow, he lauds to the skies. The maxim of this *Sir Pertimax Mac Sycophant* is to bless every man possess'd of aught to give.

"And oh! in Downing Street should old Nick revel  
"England's prime minister, he'd bless the Devil."

To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury

Sir,— From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the *Leeds Mercury*, of Saturday, August 2d, I think myself called upon, *to deny, most positively*, that any conversation passed, im my presence, of the nature alluded to in the declaration signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW". Your insertion of this, in your paper, will much oblige, Sir,

Your obedient servant,  
B. HAIGH ALLEN  
Greenhead, 2d Aug. 1817

To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury

Sir,— I have seen a Declaration, in your Paper of this Day, signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW," which I should deem unworthy of my notice, but for your insinuation that I had tampered with him. I feel it is a duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate ;  and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least intimation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any "favour" of or "tampered" with him in any way. I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting-Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry fired first, and I then observed he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he.

The paltry circumstance about the *Orange-Bribe*, arose from the complaints of George Armitage and himself being detained so long without dinner, whilst waiting upon the Grand Jury; a gentleman, on hearing them complain, gave them a biscuit, and I gave them a shilling for oranges. These *Bribes* were given in the most public manner, as many persons then present can testify.

THe Public will judge of the falsehood of Hearnshaw's Declaration, from his statement that I said, I should contradict him. when it was a well known fact that I was three miles from the Bridge at the time of the firing.

I am, Sir,  
Your obedient Servant,

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 11 August 1817

We had intended, by a future examination of the falsehoods respecting Oliver, to have shewn still more clearly the abominable and fraudulent artifices resorted to, in order to impose on the public, respecting the proceedings of that individual; but, on more mature consideration, we think his innocence has already been so irrefutably established, that all further discussion on the subject can only serve to give importance to the often-told tales of his enemies.—We shall only, therefore, give a word or two of advice to his accusers, which will put their sincerity to the test, and even this, after all that has passed, would be unnecessary, were it not that there are so many persons who are determined to adhere to falsehood in the face of conviction,

If they are so satisfied, as they pretend to be, of Oliver's guilt, why do they not have him apprehended? The man, we believe, is in London; and, no doubt, if a moderate reward be offered for taking him, they may have him lodged in safe custody within a few days after they shall have taken the proper steps for laying hold of him. Surely the Faction are not reduced so wretchedly low, that they cannot raise a sufficient sum, by subscription, to carry on a prosecution against a single individual, whom they can clearly convict, they say, of the most enormous guilt— of having laboured , as much as he could, to overthrow the security and happiness of the country, and the safety of individuals.

*Is their patriotism come to this?* They talk loudly of the sacrifices they would make for Country (though, by the way, it has so happened that they have never yet discerned a single opportunity for making any sacrifice); and yet, if we believe their own assertions, the liberty, security, and peace, of the country, are to be overthrown with impunity by Mr. Oliver, rather than a few of them will subscribe a guinea a piece to bring him to punishment ! They clamour, it is true, for Government to institute proceedings against him; but, the cunning rogues know that Government are satisfied of his innocence; and that, with all their condescension, that are not quite so complaisant as to subject an innocent man to the trouble, anxiety, and inconvenience of a trial, merely for the purpose of *pleasing them!* Let them either, therefore, drop the name of Oliver for ever, or let them subject him at once, and in a manly manner, to the operation of the law.—Let them lay information against him on oath—find persons to prosecute—and the necessary funds for carrying the prosecution on; and let them offer so small a reward its TEN GUINEAS for his apprehension; and we will stake our character for foresight on the issue, if Mr. Oliver is not taken by the neck within ten days after the reward is publicly advertised. We offer them the use of the Intelligencer for the Advertisement, if they think proper to adopt the plan recommended.

By the way, we can state, from authority, that the two Magistrates who once doubted Oliver's innocence, and who examined him, in consequence, at the Secretary of State's Office, investigated the charges against him, with the most scrupulous care, not less than two hours, before they declared themselves completely satisfied of the utter falsehood of all the fabrications against him. As the name of one of these Magistrates (perhaps without his concurrence) was employed to give some colour to the falsehoods, we have rather anxiously indulged a hope that he would come forward, and officially acknowledge he had been satisfied of Oliver's innocence. We think this is an act of Justice (though we presume not to assert it is imperative on the party in question) due to Mr. Oliver, and not only to him, but to the public at large. There is one falsehood connected with the use made of this Magistrate's name, which we ourselves are enabled to contradict. The party by whom the whole tale was tromped up, had the temerity not merely to insinuate, but directly to assert, that the Magistrate in question, at the first impulse of disgust, had some intention of throwing up his commission.— Though the " Getter-up-of-the-Plot," however, had so far imposed upon him as to succeed in making him doubt the innocence of Oliver, the idea of throwing up his commission never entered his mind, and is altogether the creation of those who fabricated so many other little circumstances, for the purpose of exciting a *great sensation* in Parliament and in the country.

But, if there are reasons sufficiently strong to induce to waive further discussion respecting Oliver, after the Public have been satisfied of his innocence, there are more weighty and powerful reasons against prolonging a controversy which involves, in some degree, the almost sacred character of a British Judge, and the purity and honour of a British Magistrate. he Magistrate has already unequivocally refuted the abominable calumny directed against him by the villainous master and tool of the vilest dregs of disaffection is this district; and, for a moment to balance "his assertion" against the " assertion of Charles Hearnshaw," and of Edward Baines, even though there were not so many other conclusive proofs that the charge was utterly false, would be offering as insult to the public sense and to public decency, and a greater outrage on the honour and feeling of Mr. Allen, as a man, a magistrate, and a gentleman, than any to which the upright discharge of his public duties has yet subjected him. The futile attempt to fix a stigma upon his name, by those whose avocation is to traduce everything truly good, and great, and virtuous, is a proof of the meritorious zeal with which he has exerted himself in the public service, and can only serve to place those exertions in the most conspicuous light ; while the abhorrent indignation of every good man is directed against his traducers.

Another of the gentlemen libelled, Mr. Thomas Atkin.on, also vindicated his name, in our last, from the foul aspersion cast upon it; though his letter was received so late, thee we could not allude to it at the same time with Mr. Allen's; and it may therefore have escaped the notice of some of our Readers. The third party libelled, Mr. Le Blanc, we find had left Yorkshire before the slander was published; and has either not yet had time to repel it, or (though the Libeller, struck with terror at the -probable consequences of his temerity, now affects to say he published the calumny, "without feeling either anxiety or responsibility about its truth,") Mr. Le Blanc may very properly have determined on calling the aggressor to account before a more solemn tribunal than that which he is afforded by the column of a newspaper.

As for the conduct of the Judge, and the history of the examination, we do most solemnly assure the Public, that what we stated in our last (to which we beg leave to refer) was the truth, and nothing but the truth. As that statement, also contained the WHOLE TRUTH, we have no new facts to communicate on the subject ; and, though it would be an easy matter to dissipate the sophistry, and to clear up the misstatements, of those who have had the audacity to pervert the facts for the vilest purposes, we entered, last week, with too much reluctance and caution upon so delicate a discussion, not to feel inclined to abstain from all unnecessary prolongation of it. It is not so with the factious agitators of this unpleasant affair. It is their object and business, to lessen, by all possible means, whether fair or foul, that just respect which is due to persons in authority. Whether they succeed or fail, therefore, in establishing a calumny, their end is partly accomplished, if they can only manage to keep the imputation for any of length of time before the public, and familiarise the minds of the lowest of the people to imputations that make them think and speak of their superiors with suspicion and disrespect. In the present instances, it would be all one to them whether the? character of the Judge, or of the Magistrate, or of both, suffered by the controversy, so as *mischief* is any how produced. They perceive we are aware of their system ; and that we are not, of course, to be betrayed by the warmth of our feelings (indignant as they are) into the furtherance of their insidious designs.
  
We are not amongst those who are inclined to attach unworthy motives to any man in the discharge of his duties; but there is a circumstance connected with this affair which is rather curious, and which clearly proves that all the perverse statements of the incendiary demagogues who labour incessantly to agitate the public mind, ought to he viewed with the greatest distrust.
  
The Mercury states, that " Mr. Allison, solicitor, of Huddersfield, (who acted as Clerk to the Magistrates  when the prisoners were committed,) said to the Judge" on the day after the misunderstanding, " My Lord, no fault whatever is imputable to Mr. Allen on account of the depositions not having been regularly laid before your Lordship; if there be any fault, it is solely attributable to myself; and my Lord, as I have not been in the habit of acting as a Magistrates' Clerk, I trust your Lordship will impute any irregularity that may have occurred, to my ignorance of what ought to have been done in this respect."
  
In this report of what was said by Mr. Allison, there is, as usual, a mixture of truth and falsehood. That gentleman did not admit that the depositions had not been laid regularly before the Judge.— He merely said, that *if* any thing was wrong, or *if* there had been any mistake, he alone, on account of his inexperience, had been to blame; and he concluded with a just tribute of respect to Mr. Allen, than whom, he said, there was not a more active or upright Magistrate in the county.
  
But, this perversion is, comparatively, of little moment. On the Mercury's own showing, Mr. Allison admitted himself to be *wholely and solely blameable for any irregularity which might have occurred*.
  
Yet, (and let the Reader mark this carefully) the Mercury *wholly and solely* attributes the blame, coupled with an imputation of the *vilest intentions*, not to Mr. Allison, but, *to the Magistrates!*—and, being secretly grateful to Mr. Allison, for any (supposed) mistake, which tended materially to defeat the ends of public justice, the Mercury, instead of *blaming* him, to whom alone, if there was any blame at all, that blame is due, warmly eulogises Mr. Allison for his professional abilities, compliments him on his modesty, and particularly praises him for his skill and experience as a Magistrate's Clerk! ! !
  
Not one word more, we are satisfied, is necessary to make the blood of every honest man boil with indignation at the systematic and villainous attempts which are made to excite hatred of the Magistracy and of the laws, amongst the people.
  
Further, however, it is well known that Mr. Allison is of *Whig principles!* The Committing Magistrates, happily, are not of his party! The foul mind of the Mercury, if a similar event had occurred Under other circumstances—if a *Tory* Magistrates' Clerk had committed a mistake as favourable to *Tory* prisoners before a *Whig* tribunal—in such a case, we say, the Mercury would not have hesitated to assert, or at least to insinuate, that the mistake had been purposely *committed, in order prejudice the Judge and Jury against the prosecution, and against the conduct and motives of the Prosecutors!*
  
Though this certainly was *the fatal effect of the misunderstanding in question*, we would spurn, with as much indignation as Mr. Allison himself, at so base and unworthy a suspicion. He discharged his duty, *we are not the slightest doubt*, to the best of his ability, and with perfect integrity;—and we have put the preceding case, merely for the purpose of exposing to him, and *to all other respectable men of his party*, the extreme danger of giving credit to, or at all countenancing, the slanderous imputations of any low, despicable, and seditious demagogue, conscientiously discharging public official duties.— Let them not be flattered into becoming the instruments of such men,— lest they be *judged by their own judgement*.
  
> In reading of the Trials at the late Assizes in various parts of the kingdom, we have been very much disgusted to observe the flippancy which several of the Gentlemen of the Bar appear to have conducted themselves.—"There be of them that will themselves launch, to set on some quantity of barren? spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the *suit* be then to be considered; that's villainous; and shows a most pitiful ambition in him who uses it." It is a practice that ought to be generally discountenanced ; for can any thing be more intolerable than that when the character and property of any man, however humble, are at stake in a Court of Justice, his counsel, instead of evincing the anxiety which would become him on such an occasion, is to be occupied in racking his memory for a stale joke, or availing himself of any passing occurrence to vent some miserable pun ;  in order, as he perhaps conceives, to show his country auditor what a smart man a London barrister is. This is one of those offences against good sense and decency, which we think it behoves every public writer to visit with marked reprobation; and in saying his we are sure that credit will be given to us for entertaining towards the legal profession all the respect to which it is justly entitled when the duties of that profession are discharged,—as, happily, in most instances, the are discharged,—with fidelity and dignity.—*Courier*
  
The preceding judicious observations of the *Courier*, apply so well to the treatment of Mr. David Alexander, that we adopt them at once in alluding to the very unhandsome manner in which one of the Counsel for the prisoners attempted to show off his wit, at Mr. A.'s expense, during the trial of Lockwood, Woffendan, &c. at our late assizes.
  
Besides resorting to every artifice of the law, in favour of their clients (with which we do not mean to find any fault), and exerting themselves in every possible manner to prejudice the minds of the Jury against the prosecution, and in favour of the prisoners, one of the Counsel thought fit to single out Mr. Alexander as a mark for his wit, levelling at him the coarsest and most indecorous sarcasms, while he was giving his evidence, though he had the mortification of failing to excite a single risible expression on the countenances of the persons present.
  
Mr. Alexander had been, on two occasions, in the discharge of his duty, not as an ordinary soldier, but as an armed citizen, exposing himself for the protection of his neighbours, and the preservation of the public peace, *fired at in one night*. Some cowardly ruffian shot at him, under cover of the night, while he was on foot, going for his horse; and he was afterwards exposed, in front, to the fire of the insurgents at Folly-hall-bridge, where his horse was severely wounded under him. He had displayed a spirit and intrepidity which entitle him to respect, and which must receive the approbation and thanks of every man who is disposed to appreciate those qualities when exhibited in a good cause; and, the only return which was made him for having twice exposed his life to imminent hazard, for the protection of those who were quietly and comfortably asleep in their beds, was to be held up as an object of ridicule to the Court of Justice in which he was called upon to perform another service to the public, by giving his evidence on a case of flagrant public outrage;— to be jeered at about the " sanguinary battle of Folly-hall-bridge in which he had been *engaged*"— *rigged* as the term is, about his "military tactics"—and ironically asked if he had obtained his martial skill and courage at *Waterloo!*
