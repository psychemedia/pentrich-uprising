POLITICAL INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE

In the second edition of our last publication, we stated some particulars, which had just reached us, of a rumoured insurrection in this district, and also the arrest of ten persons near Dewsbury, on a charge of treasonable practices. We shall now proceed to lay before our readers all the information which we have been able to collect upon the subject, and our researches have been conducted with great diligence, with perfect impartiality, and with the most anxious wish to come at the truth. We shall first shortly state what appears to have been the object and extent of the plot, and then detail those circumstances which either attended its developement, or which have subsequently occurred. It appears, that almost immediately after the suppression of the Union Societies, established in different towns in this district for effecting a reform in Parliament, some of the most violent members associated together, in a private and clandestine manner. At these meetings it is supposed to have become a question for deliberation, whether a change in the representation might not be effected without the intervention of Parliament, and a project to effect this purpose appears to have been communicated to them by Mr. Oliver, who had been introduced to these Ultra Reformers by Mitchell, (a Delegate, now in custody,) as a person deserving their confidence, and not only disposed to comnmunicate to them interesting information as to the state of the country; but able to afford them the most affectual assistance ; thus recommended, he soon possessed himself of their unbound confidence. This person is said to have represented to these credulous men, that all the people in the metropolis were favourable to a complete change of Government, that every thing was organised, and that it was absolutely settled, that on the night preceding the trial of the state prisoners, (the night of the 8th June,) a general rising, would take place; that as a consequence of this movement, all the public offices were to be taken possession of, all the constituted authorities seized, and the state prisoners released ; and that a plan had also been arranged for securing all the military, by which means a change in the government would be effected, without any effusion blood. It was further represented to them, that in order to carry out this bloodless revolution, it was absolutely necessary that the same plan should be simultaneously acted upon in all parts of the country ;- that it was therefore necessary, that on the night agreed upon, namely on Sunday the 8th inst. all the military in every district of the kingdom should be secured in their quarters, their arms seized, and that the magistrates and other civil officers should be arrested and placed in a state of restraint, not merely that no opposition might be made to the designs of the insurgents, but that they might serve as hostages for the safety of such of their own party as might fall into the hands of government. This absurd and wicked project is said to have been entertained, and in some degree acted upon, by a number of imdividuals in different parts of this district ; and a participation in this plot is alleged against the persons who were apprehended yesteday se'nnigh, at Thornill Lees, charged with having assembled there, for the purpose of carrying into immediate effect this daring and traitorous project. Our readers will probably infer, from this statement, that the person introduced by Mitchell to the Ultra Reformers, was, in truth, a spy, and that every step taken towards the execution of the project, had been communicated to persons in authority, as th6eplot appears to have been known by some of the Magistrates for several weeks past. On Friday morning last, several of the Delegates, together with the informer, met at a public house, in this town, and proceeded in the direction of Dewsbury, and from thence to Thornhill Lees, where they had no sooner arrived at the house of rendesvous than they were surrounded by a detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, and taken into custody. The following is a correct list of the names and paces of redisence of the persons apprehended:

John Smaller, shoemaker, Horbury, near Wakefield.  
Thomas Murray, Flax-Weaver, Leeds.  
James Mann, Cloth-Dresser, Leeds.  
Thomas Wood, Clothier, Westgate Common, Wakefield.  
Michael Waller, a Publican, and formerly keeper of the Yew-Tree, Robert-Town.
Miles Illingworth, Carpenter, Manningham, near Bradford.  
Benjamin Whitley. Cloth-Dresser, Holmfirth.  
Edward Fletcher, Card-Maker, High-Town.  
Joseph Midgley, Clothier, Almondbury.  
Wm. Walker, Clothier, Thornhill, near Dewsbury.

The prisoners were immediatedy conveyed in carriages, escorted by the Yeomanry Cavalry, to Wakefield, and lodged in the Court-House, where they were examined for several hours by Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry,Esq, and other magistrates there assembled. The examination wsa private; some circumstances have, however, transpired, which we shall state. It was asserted by one of the witnesses examined, that in a barn at Whitley, near the place of meeting, there were deposited one hundred pikes, and 50 stand of fire arms; it was further stated by the same witness, that in the house of John Smaller, of Horbury, would be found a quantity of ball cartridges. Messengers were instantly dispatched to search both these places, and it is important to state, that, on removing the straw in the barn, not a single pike or fire arm could be discovered, and it was the opinion of the persons who searched the premises, that the straw had not been disturbed for a considerable time. That part of the evidence which related to the ball cartidges was also falsified, nothing of the kind having been found in the house of Smaller. We have introduced the result of these important searches in this place, though, in the order of the narrative, it ought to have been introduced somewhat later. The Court-House at Wakefield, was surrounded by an immense assemblage of persons during the whole of the examination. About eight o'clock the prisoners were remanded until Monday, to the House of Correction, for further examination. They were escorted by the cavalry, who were dismounted, the escort was attacked by the populace with stones, brick-bats, &c. thrown with great violence. The prisoners were, however, safely lodged tn the House of Correction.

On Saturday, the succeeding day, two troops of the 13th regiment of Light Dragoons arrived in this town, from York, and that day and Sunday passed over without the slightest indication of insubordination, though not without alarm ; for about midnight on Sunday, the town was thrown into the greatest consternation by the bugle sounding for the Cavalry, who remained on duty at he Court-House all night, in consequence of some alarming reports which had reached the magistrates, (who were also at the Court-House,) of an intention to rescue the prisoners at Wakfield. An express was immediately sent there to call out the Yeomanry Cavalry, who instantly assembled and continued on duty all day. No attempts at release were made, and the day passed over at Wakefield in tranquillity. We regret, however, to state, that an attempt was made in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to assassinate one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, about one o'clock on Monday morning, by firing a loaded pistol, the ball of which lodged irn the forehead of the horse belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Huddersfield, but the ball has been extracted, and the horse is likely to recover. We understand that an outrage of a similar nature, was committed the same night, at Ossett, a village near Dewsbury, where the house of a member of the Yeomanry Cavalry was beset by a number of persons who demanded his arms, and on his refusal to give them up, fired several shots into the house. Five persons have been apprehended at Huddersfield, and its neighbourhood, on a charge of being concerned in the former of these daring outrages.â€” They have since been committed to York Castle, on a charge of malicious firing: they passed through this place yesterday afternoon, accompanied by an escort of the Huddersfield Yeomannry Cavalry.

The following is a list of their names and residence:

Abram Oldbarn, and John Oldham, of Honley.  
Isaac Johnson, and Joshua Knowles, of Holmfirth.  
John Rhodes, (late of Holbeck), Holmfirth.  

The re-examination of the prisoners charged with High Treason, took place at the House of Correction, in Wakefield, on Monday, where the Magistrates were holding a special Session for enquiring into the state of that gaol. The number of gentlemen on the Commission who attended on this occasion was uncommonly great, among others, were Sir F. L. Wood, Bart. Rev. W. R. Hay, (Chairman of the Manchester Sessions,) Rev. Wm. Wood, Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and Benj Haigh Allen, Esq., Wm. Prest, Esq. the Mayor of this borough, was also present. This examination was, in the strictest sense, private, as no person, except the Magistrates, was suffered to remain in the room during the discussion of this subject. The prisoners were merley examined *pro forma*; they were brought into the room separately, and informed that their further examination was deferred until the following Monday, until which time they were re-committed. No witnesses were examined affecting the prisoners, and the meeting might rather be termed a Committee of inquiry, than a meeting of Justices for the judicial examination of prisoners. It may be presumed from this unusually long adjouranment of the examination, that no evidence has yet been given against the prisoners which can warrant their committal for High Treason, and it is reasonable the re-committal has been with the view of detaining them until instructions can be received from government as to to their ultimate disposal. We understand that some important papers have been found in the House of James Mann, the Leeds Delegate. In using the term *delegate*, we do not mean to insinuate that these persons have been elected by any body of men whatever; there is no evidence of any such delegation, and the probability is, that they represent nobody but themselves. We think it right to make this remark, lest it should be supposed that they were delegated by the places where they appear to be resident, which would have given a very formidable aspect to this plot, and a degree of importance to which it is by no means entitled. The conspiracy appears to have been confined to a relatively small numnber of persons, and was of a nature which the laws of the country afforded ample means to suppress. It appears also to have been of a very recent date, and to have originated in the injudiciouts, and we will add, unconstitutional measures adopted by Ministers to seek the expression of the public feeling relative to a  Reform in Parliament. It must be further remembered, that the account we have given of the plot must be considered in the nature of an *ex-parte* statement, and must rest for its credibility, very considerably, on the reliance which can be placed on the witnesses, who do not come before the public in a light which entitle them to much credit, and whose evidence has been materially broken in upon, by circumstances stated in the above account. It must be further recollected, that all the persons apprehended are of the lowest class of society,illiterate, and ill-informed, and liable to be the dupes of designing men. The great mass of the people are, we are convinced, free from any knowledge or concurrence in the plot. In short, when the whole is dispassionately considered, there appears no ground for that excessive panic and alarm which the first announcement of the plot produced, much less does afford any legitimate ground for a renewed suspension of the Constitutional rights of the people.

We feel great satisfaction in having to state that the most perfect tranquillity has prevailed here during the whole of the past week, and that the alarm by which the announcement of so many plots had produced, has nearly subsided.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14 June 1817

SECOND EDITION

Since the first edition of our paper was prepared for the press, the highly important fact has been communicated to us, from a respectible, quarter, that the plot referred to in the above statement has been got up under the instigation of an agent from London, and that the principlal offender has been suffered to escape with impunity. In confirmation of this fact, which was communicated to us at a late hour yesterday afternoon, we were referred to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, in Dewsbury. To develop a transaction so important, not only to the Government and the people of this country in general, but so intimately connected with the liberty and lives of the accused, we felt it to be our imperious duty to repair to Dewsbury, without a moment's delay, and there to ascertain, on the spot, the truth of the allegation.

As a precautionary measure, we drove to the house of one of the first merchant-manufacturers in the town, and Mr. Willans be sent for, he suggested, that in order to render the investigation complete, Mr. John Dickinson, a linen-draper in that place, should be invited to attend. This suggestion being adopted, Mr. Dickinson also attended, and the following is the result of our investigaitons into the mysterious transactions which formed the subject of our inquiry:â€”

Mr Willans stated, and the truth of his assertions his is willing to confirm by his solemn affirmation, that, about two months ago, a person of the name of *Oliver*, called upon him, and introduced himself as a Parliamentary Reformer, sent form London, to ascertain the dispositions of the people in the country. This man he describes as a person of genteel appearance and good address, nearly six feet high, of erect figure, light hair, red and rather large whiskers, and a full face a little pitted with the small-pox. His usual dress, he says, was a light fashionable coloured brown coat, black waistcoat, dark blue mixture pantaloons, and Wellington boots. The description of such a characer is important, and may form a clue to fuurther discoveries, connected with his proceedings in other parts of the country.

Mr. Oliver, he says, called upon him several times after his first introduction, and in one of his subsequent calls, said, that as it was quite obvious that Government would not listen to the petitions of the people, it had now become necessary that they should be compelled to attend to their demands. These insinuations Mr. Willans silenced by the observation, that he could not enagage in any proceeding that implied the use of force, or the shedding of human blood. On another occasion, Mr. Oliver told him, that he (Oliver) was one of a committee of five that effected the escape of young Watson, and that if Thistlewood had had equally prudent counsels, he would also have escaped. In fact, the whole tenor of Oliver's conversation went to show that he had traitorous designs, and that he was in league with traitors.

Such conversation, as might be supposed, awaked Mr. Willans's suspicions, and the intercourse between them had almost ceased, when, on Friday morning last, the day the ten persons were arrested at Thornhill Lees near Dewsbury, he again called at Mr. Willan's shop between 10 and 11 o'clock, and Mr. W. being absent on business, he begged that his wife would tell him, that a meeting of delegates was to be held on that day, at Thornhill, and earnestly requested that she would use her influence to prevail upon her husband to attend. Before Oliver quitted Dewsbury to attend the meeting, he called again at the shop, when he found Mr. Willans had returned. He accordingly renewed his solicitations to Mr. W. to attend the meeting, telling him at the same time, that "*his friends in London "were almost heart-broken that the people in the country were so quiet.*" At the same time he informed him, that he had walked over from Leeds that morning, and two persons supposed to be Leeds men, appeared in his train. Unmoved by Oliver's solicitations, Mr. Willans persisted in his resolution not to attend the meeting, and owing to his obstinacy, Dewsbury was prevented from swelling the number of *deputies*, so called.

At the appointed time, the meeting was held at Thornhill Lees, and the toils being set, eleven deputies, Mr. Oliver being of the number, were taken by a detachment of cavalry, and all except Mr. Oliver, who had the *good fortune* to be liberated, were conveyed to Wakefield in custody.

While the examinations were proceeding at the Court-House, Mr. Oliver had repaired to his quarters, which were at the Strafford-Arms, that is, the head inn in Wakefield. Here, to his great consternation and confusion, he was recognized by Mr. John Dickinson, who had seen him at Dewsbury, and had heard that he was a leading man at the private meetings. Advancing up to Oliver, Mr. Dickinson addressed him, and the following conversation took place:

*Mr. Dickinson.* How does it happen, Mr. Oliver, that you, who appear to have taken so leading a part in the meetings, are at liberty, while your associates are likely to be sent in custody to London?

*Mr. Oliver.* No papers were found upon me, and being a *stranger*, the persons who apprehended us were obliged to set me at liberty.

These observations were made in a very hurried manner, and Mr. Oliver withdrew to take a seast in the Wakefiled coach to Leeds.

As soon as Mr. Oliver had placed himself in the coach, a servant in livery stepped up to him, and, moving his hat, entered into conversation with him.

This circumstance, combined with the extraordinary reasons that Oliver had given for his liberation, induced Mr. Dickinson to inquire of the servant, after the coach had left the inn, if he knew that Gentleman ? to which the servant replied, that he had seen him at Campsall, and he had driven him a few days before in his master's tandem from that place to the Red-house to meet the coach. On receiving this information, Mr. Dickinson eqnuired who his master was ? to which the servant replied, General Byng. He then left him, and asked Mr. Tyler, who keeps the Strafford Arms, if he knew Oliver ? to which Mr. Tyler replied, that he had been there several times â€” that he believed he was form London â€” and that several London letters had come directed to him at that inn.

From every thing we have heard of the character and conduct of General Byng, we are persuaded that he has been merely the medium for receiving Oliver's information, and that whoever may have employed this double-distilled traitor, the General has acted merely in the discharge of his official duty. But every circumstance we have just related, proves, that somebody has employed him, and the question isâ€” who were his employers?

What the trade of this man may be, we cannot pretend to sayâ€”but that he is a *Green Bag Maker* by profession is, we think, sufficiently obvious. Why such a wretch, the main spring and master-piece of the conspiracy, by which the country has been thrown into its present state of alarm and agitation, was suffered to escape, while the poor unfortunate victims of his machinations are held in confinement, is more than we can say; but the subject requires deep and grave investigation, and we call upon the magistrates of this riding, now that we have given them the clue, to go to the bottom of this nefarious transaction.

We ask this boon from them in support of their own characterâ€” we ask it from a regard to the character of the countryâ€” we ask it from a regard to the Governmentâ€” we ask it in justice to the advocates of Parliamentary Reformâ€” and above all, we conjure them to enter into this inquiry, from a regard to all the families and the lives of the men at present in confinement, on the information of this prototype of Lucifer, whose distinguishing characteristic it is, first to tempt and then to destroy.

We have been favoured with the following extract of a letter received yesterday from Nottingham, by a Mercantile house in this town :-

"*Nottingham, June 12th, 1817.*

An insurrection was fully expected by the Magistrates to have begun here on the 9th inst. We remained, however, perfectly quiet ; but on the 10th, a great number of persons out of Derbyshire, armned with pikes and guns, which they stole on their route, approached this place: they advanced as far as Eastwood (8 miles distant) where they were encountered by Mr. Rolleston, a very active county Magistrate, supported by a troop of dragoons, when they immediately fled in all directions, leaving about 26 of their number prisoners, who were conducted forthwith to the County gaol ; one person was shot dead by the *insurgents* for not delivering up his arms when required, and another was shot by accident; these, we believe, are all the casualties that have occurred. We are perfectly quiet at present, and the Magistrates are very active. We hope, therefore, that there is an end of the business."

The neighbourhood of Huddersfield was thrown into consternation on Sunday night, by an attack made about 12 o'clock, on six of the horse-patrole, at Folly-Hall Bridge, near that place, by a number of men with arms. A volley was fired, and one of the horses struck on thre head, by a ball, which has since been extracted. The patrole finding their number too small to attack their adverdaries, retired after a shot had been fired by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was wounded; and by the time the main body with the infantry reached the place, the whole of the assailants had dispersed.

...

The Secret Committee of the House of Commons, which is expected to recommend the continued Suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act, was appointed on Thursday. It differs only from, the former Committee in the substitutiom of the present Solicitior-General for the late Attorney-General. ...

EXPLODED PLOTS.

The inquisition made in our last paper of the plotters against the public tranquility, has produced a sensation in the Metropolis â€“ the Senate â€“ and the nation at large, that has seldom been exceeded. One of its first effects was to procure the liberation of the the principal part of the persons charged with holding a a political meeting for treasonable purposes, at Thornill Lees, in this county ; and the magistrates of the West Riding, with a proper regard to their own characters and to the public interest, have done themselves lasting honour, by setting at liberty the men, whom a perfidious conspirator, acting under a superior agency, had marked out for his victims. By this exposure, the secret springs of a diabolical conspiracy, not of the people, but against the people, have been laid bare. The real conspirators have been exhibited to public view.


TO DO 

The nature and the objects of the plots have been disclosed, and all the trepidation and alalms with which the public had been seized, have given way to an btha universally felt indignation against the alarmists and whe their emissaries. Tise effect has been almost magical. it. The blow aimed at the friends to reform, has been Ion; snade, by a retributive recoil, to fall upon the heads of fied their adversaries, and every manl, with anr English essee heart in his bosom, whatever his party or his political retu predilections, feels himself insulted and outraged by the attempts made to convert the most populous and this important part of the kingdom into a scene of conspi. fled caries, and his countrymen into a nation of traitors. whi, The account published in the second edition of our last paper, and which will be found in sthe parliamess. divi tary proceedings of the present week, has proved to be tou in every important particular correct. From that account it ?? tise Yorkeshire Plot was got i"P Mr. by a political ageist of else namn of Oliver, from London-that this man, under the guise of an ardent zeal bins for the cause of Parliamentary Reform, did not hesitate to suggest to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, at bews. met! bury, the propriety and nercessity of resorting to force I' for the purpose of compelling Government to grant we 1 that by coercion, which they were disinclined to concede to petitions. 'That, on the day when the meetin tios at Tlhsorn~hihl was appointed to held, he ensdeavoured, ofls by thse niost urgessc entreaties, to prevail upon Mr. nty WA'illans to attend that mneeting, and that in the course of conversation, he told Mr. W. that ' his" Mr. ehir Oliver's "1 friends in London were alincst heart-brohen sollr that the people in thiei country were so quiet." Who1 dtsr 'Mr. Oliver's friends, or at least his employers, are, the a Earl of Liverpool has, with great candour, inforused Othst Ctse cossitry ; but why tisey lshouldl he so much disquieted at the tranquillity of the people, we shahltiot thle pretend to conjecture. It furtiter appeared, froti the futi statement above referred to, til~tt Mr. Willans refused po to attend the umeeting at Thornihill, anti that Dewsbury PCO was thereby deprived of a depuly. Whatever msigit Wi be tite disinclination of Mr. W~illaris to attettd the ga meeting, Mr. Oliver, it steists, was rlot actuated by gag, this sassie motives-lihe attenided-was taken into cus- ds tody alossg with teis other delegates, a1nd was suff'ered disca to escape -"because lie was a stranger, and had no pa- mot pers about him." Tite next appearance of thsis strai-l mo ger was at Wakcefield, ois the day atid *at the mioisent on whsen rthepersons apiprehended with him were under W examiattaiots before the magistrates at that place, and the there it wtis discovered by a singular train of incidente, Wa titit a few days before the meeting at rThornhill, Oliver the1 was sst thle ho'ase of General Sir Johnt Bynig, ithe cons- burt msanrier of else district, and that lie was conveyed in sjsir else General's tandem to meet the coach, whirls ll bore Isins to the scene of lils delitsquencies. This dis- met covery, so fortunate for tite coutitry, will be considered itis as~ a s il isterposition of st Superlintending Power, plai in tisvour of the country; anid 'we sisy say with truthl witl list linger of Providessce was there." *la,, Otl this part of thle expmsure as few ebservatioiss will w sulfite. Every lintl of the chain of evidence is, per. feet. The conduct of Oliver, the hsfnrmer, admits of no feerther disguise-it is perfectly clear that he insti- o gatedh persons to attend at Thornhill, on tise day in, tuis question, aisd tisere is reason to suppose that he Ititti of ' self apspointed thse meeting. What were his instnuc- tiea tiotns we cannot say, but lie is completely, identifietdjl with men in an official situation, by a speceis'of evi-al dence that scarcely stood in need of the adisission 'netl made by Lord Liverpool,- that lie was aii agent of i Government. But, says his Lordship, else account in sot Cthe Leeds Mercury is an e-aesThteset, isd asue in, such must .not be implicitly relied upon.Tati true usli my Lord, aisd our anxiety is, that it should nIO Longer bif lbe ex-jsertr. We invite your Lordship to deprive it lie of thsis citaracter, by ae rigorous investigation into all 1 hie the facts of the case; and this investigation, we be. aft, seeds your Lordshipttnd your colleagues to insttt, tbu, before the Suspension Bill, founded upon these alleged tis conspiracies, is suffered to advance another stage in .VIC its progress. Whether the bill to renew to Miisisters ant tlse power of exe rcising a despotiec contsroal over the Pe lilserties of their countrymen, list produced the Plots, the or the plots have produced Cthe bill, it is nor our pre- po sent busneess to inquire ; but we feel it our duty to say, cl as a cirtrnsstarte coining withsis our own knowledge, J0t tisar, in else inquiries which we made at Dewsbury, the Atl dty before time facts we have developed were laid before for the public, we never recollect en hsive heard a fvitneqs art give his evidessce, evess in a court of justice, and ?? ocath, witis a more scrnpi'llous regard to truth than Mr. to I Willans. If Ilie erred, as he certainly did, in suffer- sa lug a traitor like Oliver to come isear his Isouse, after ahe he had, by insin'sation, communicated Isis villainouss NV designs, lhe has usade ampsle reparation to Isis country Mitl for his crieor, by Isavitig first declined to attend a bei ms-etting, tlse object of which lie coissislered to be fill tnscilrievous, anti thenr, by maksing those disclosures, ofe 5 even at the risk of this oisloquy to whsich they were ilie I sure to subject him, whirls have tended to put down a eli system of ceposgie1,7 contemplating first the seduction of r of his Majesty's subjects frome their allegiance, and up I then tise destruction of the sedluced attd the cx.

Oliver replieid, that lie did not dare to dde.1L return to London till the State Trials were over, atid, iti1gi onl being asleed the caciso of his fears, lie said lie had to a' assisted young Watson in effecting his escape.

At parting, Mrl. Scholes said and to Oliver, "1 Now. Sir, I beg. that from this timee, Only You will never' call upon me again." In thea course to ti' ofthe evening, several men, who were drinking in lenci Mr. Sclioles's house, told hins that Oliver had iippoini- Semi ed a meeting at Ponistone the next day, and asked mag hint his opinion of Oliver anil his measures ; to which . he replied, "1 for God's Sake keep from Oliver and his Dirl useetings, for he is a base villain." tinel F'rontl the period of the l'cnistone meeting, which, is Sil we believe, wvas held on the 1st of June, tilk~tle eve to Ii of else Thtornhill nieetiitg onl the 6th of Jluie, we-have 1- ( no specific inforinaticis respecting rthe operations of Mr. it Oliver, but we undeirsta'nd, that a little before the time c t of the former meeting, tlhis incenditiry mnade a jotir- ' ney to Loitdon, and that, in the interval, hr woe tra- emp velliitg about itt thle counties of Nottinghiami, Derby- ct] Shire, Staffordshire, and Lancasihire, lahouring, no I It; dottlt, in his vocatiois. For the hionour of hunsan na- rote Cure, isoe hope that the use made by Mr. Oliver of Ctle bett names of Sir Firancis Bordett, Major Cartwrinht, atid others, was not authorized by Ministers ; but after such a specimen of the vile arts employed to traduce " 1 tile friends of Parliaricientary Reformi, we tire nelt in future to be surprised at aity caluminies that may be IF proptagated against them. -in 0 We have alre!ady stated, from the testimony of Mr. dres Willans and Mlr.

RFPORT of the COMMITTEE of SECRECY.

*Further Suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act.*

In the House of Lords, on Thursday the 12th inst. the *Earl of Harrowby* presented a Report from the Committee of Secrecy, which was read by the Reading Clerk at the table. The Report began by stating, that the Committee had taken into their serious consideration the papers referred to in the Prince Regent's Message, and they felt it their duty to state, that it appeared from the evidence before them, that the practices, meetings, and combinations, alluded to in their former Report, still continued in various parts of the country, having for their object the overthrow of the Constitution and Government, and the destruction of the established system of order and tranquillity. The evidence upon which they founded their opinion, was in part derived from persons implicated in these transactions, and from individuals who had participated in them, with the view of making communications on the subject to the Magistrates or to the Secretary of State. With respect to these latter persons, the Committee thought it right to state that in some instances they had urged on other individuals to acts of violence, instead of merely watching what these individuals did. Making, however, every allowance for the exaggerations which had thus risen, the Committee had evidence before them, of the accuracy of which there was no doubt, that disaffection to a considerable extent prevailed in the manufacturing districts in the northern parts of the kingdom. It was undoubtedly true, that in some of these districts there existed considerable distress; but it was equally true, that the distress of which actually existed must be considered the instrument rather than the cause of disaffection, it being the fact, that in many places were the pressure was most grievous, the people evinced the greatest loyalty, patience, and good order. -The Committee had found since the last Report, the practices at Manchester had been continued, and that a meeting was summoned to be held there on the 3d of March, which was numerously attended, and at which the most inflammatory language was used. It was proposed and agreed to at this meeting, to hold another meeting on to the 10th of March, and it was recommended that ten out of every twenty assembled on the latter day, should be in readiness to proceed to London, for the pretended purpose of presenting a petition to the Prince Regent, with which view they were to provide themselves with blankets, shoes, &c. The meeting was held, and attended by from 10 to 12.000 persons, notwithstanding several of the ringleaders had been previously arrested, and the project of proceeding to London was attempted to be carried into effect, but the deluded individuals were stopped through the activity of the Magistrates at different short distances, and compelled to retrace their steps. It appeared it was held oat to them that they would be joined on the road by large bodies from different towns, so that by the time they advanced towsards London they would be 100,000. The grossest delusions were, in fact, held out to persons assembled upon that occasion, nor could the project itself be considered in any other light than as directed against the public tranquillity, which must necessarily have been considerably endangered by the attempt of a considerable body of men to advance in the manner proposed to London.â€” After this period, it appeared that the additional power entrusted to the Government had some effect, and that numerous meetings were not attempted to be held, but secret meetings were assembled in remote places; and though some societies were broken up, and some public houses would not receive them, they contrived to assemble in other houses in a lonely situation. At some of these meetings the most undisguised language was used; it was no longer Parliamentary Reform that was held up as a pretext, but Revolutibn was openly advocated; the individuals attempted to be influenced were called upon to provide arms (though the committee had been unable to trace any arrangement made for the actual procuring of arms), and it was even held out that persons in office, and others obnoxious to them, ought to be got rid of. A general rising was contemplated early in April, but from some circumstances it was put off till June. In the mean time, numerous meetings, in consequence of the additional power placed in the hands of Government, not being deemed advisable, a system of delegation was established, and persons calling themselves delegates assembled at different places. It was held out, that it would not be advisable to commit much to writing, and that the names of the leaders should be as much as possible concealed. These persons calling themselves delegates, repeatedly assembled, and kept up an extensive correspondence. An assembly of these delegates was held at a town in Yorkshire, early in May, at which it was determined that a general rising should take phice on the 10th of June. Nottingham was to be the head quarters of the insurgents. They were to obtain arms by plundering the barracks and other depots, and to march in a large body to London. It appeared that the conspirators had even gone the length of contemplating the destruction of Manchester, for the purpose of adding to the discontent, by throwing a great number of persons out of employ. The signal was to be given by a rocket being fired; upon which the manufactories and other buildings were to be destroyed. The project was frustrated by the activity of thle Magistrates, and it appeared that the project of the general uprising had also been frustrated; but there were some districts in which the parties had determined on rising, notwithstanding the determination of this meeting of delegates; and the evidence before the Committee upon this subject had been confirmed by the recent appearance of bodies of men in arms at a the precise period which is stated to have been fixed upon, an particularly in one of the districts, which had latterly been represented as determined to act without waiting for a general insurrection. The Committee, in taking this view of certain parts of the country, which was unfortunately too well supported by the evidence and documents before them, felt it their duty to state, that in other quarters there was a general feeling of loyalty and attachment to the Government ; and that, even in the disturbed districts, the greater part of the people were loyally attached to the Governmnent. The Magistrates had displayed the greatest activity in frustrating the projects of the disaffected, and they were powerfully aided by the loyal support of the population. The Magistrates, however, were of opinion, that the most effectual means of putting down the disaffected, and frustrating their projects, had risen out of the additional powers placed in the hands of Government: and the Committee were of opinion, upon the whole view of the case, that, in order to trustrate effectually the projects of disaffection, it was absolutely necessary to continue the additional powers vested in the hands of Government, the ordinary laws being insufficient for the purpose.â€” The Report was laid on the table, and ordered to be printed.

ALSO: article on YEOMANRY CAVALRY givening notice to residents of Leeds that such a domestic force will be raised.

OLIVER THE SPY.-

A fact has come to our knowledge connected with the the mission of this arch traitor, which, though it can be communicated in a few words, speaks volumes to the mind of every British subject. On the first arrival of Mr. Oliver in the neighbourhood of *Sheffield*, where he spread terror among the peaceable and well-disposed part of the inhabitants, and by his flattering representations imparted joy and confidence to the disaffected and evil-minded, the vigilance of the magistrates at that place enabled them to trace out his proceedings, and to discover that he was disemminating the poison of his treasons in every direction. The first use made by the magistrates of this discovery was to apprise the conservators of the public peace in other parts of the riding of the arrival of this incendiary, and their next step was to address a letter to the Secretary of State for the home department informing him that a *London Deleqate*, a man apparently above the lower ranks, had arrived in the country, and was actively employed in organizing sedition and exciting the people to acts of treason. This letter was written by Hugh Parker, Esq. the senior magistrate of the district, who, by return af post, received an answer from Lord Sidmouth, informing him that the person he described as so dangerous a character was an *Agent of Govermment !!!* Indignant at this communication, Mr. Parker's first determination was to withdraw his name from the comnmission of the peace, but his repugnaance to shrink from his duty at time of public exigency overcame his detestation of the system which ministers had adopted, and he was prevailed upon to continue those services which have reflected so much honour on his own character, and so much benefit on the country. When Lord Sidmouth's *long promised* statement regarding the employment given by government to a herd of spies and informers makes its appearance, we hope he will indulge the public with the correspondence which passed between his lordship and the Sheffield magistracy. We should be glad too if the Magistrates would publish the examinations taken before the Lord-Lieutenant at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th. ult. If we are rightly informed, those examinations confirm every material point of the statement regarding Mr. Oliver, made in this paper two days before; and it has been stated distinctly in the House of Commons, that the *only material called for the crown* on that occasion, swore that Mr. Oliver got up, or prepared the whole plot. We beg to direct the attentiosn of our readers to the speech of Mr Bennett on the third reading of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and we should be glad if some Member of the House would move, in his place, for the production of Bradley's evidence.

On this subject Lord Castlereagh has dauntlessly declared that government do employ spies, and has represented them as necessary to the safety of the state. Under an administration such as that formed by his lordship and his co-adjutors this may be the case, but *good* ministers, like *good* princes, require no spies, and the words of Montesquieu, whose skill in the science of politics would not suffer by a comparison with any of the present ministers individually, or with the whole of them collectively, has said:â€” " Should I be asked whether there is any necessity for spies in monarchies, my answer would be, that the usual practice of good princes is not to employ them. The trade of a spy might perhaps be tolerable were it practised by honest men, but the *necessary* infamy of the person is sufficient to make us judge of the infamy of the thing."

It has been insinuated, that in making the exposure we have exhibited to the public, we have been influenced by factious motives, and that our object has been merely to annoy the servants of the Crown, and to advance the interests of a party. Supposing this to be the case, the motives would not disprove the facts. But we claim the merit of higher influence. That we have our party predilections we are free to confess, but we have much more regard for our country than for our party. It has been stated that we are ultra-reformers, or as the phrase in the *Sun** Newspaper is " reformers of the modern school." This assertion we deny, and we appeal to facts for the veracity of our disclaimer. It is known by every man who has read our sentiments on Parliamentary Reform, as published in this paper, that without presuming to condemn the advocates of universal suffrage and annual parliaments, we have never been the supporter of those measures. It is known too, that at the meeting held in this town for the purpose of voting a Petition to the Legislature on the subject of Parliamentary Reform, we stedfastly and successfully opposed the introduction of a motion for assembling adjourned meetings, maintaining that they had the appearatice of holding out a menace to government. It is also known, that when the practice prevailed last year of sending out political missionaries, for the purpose of inculcating the principles of Parliamentary Reform, we openly and perseveringly condemned the policy, and exposed the impropriety of such a proceeding, and it was probably owing to this cause that we never had the honour of a call from MR. OLIVER. It is further known, that we supported to the best of our power the benevolent views of those who, during the past year of general distress, exerted themselves to relieve the labouring classes by providing them food at a reasonable price; and that we pointedly condemned the censure cast upon institutions established for that purpose; but it, is not known, perhaps, though it is nevertheless true,that we never were connected at any time with any political society whatever. In making these statements, we must repeat that we are not to be understood as conveying any censure towards. those who have pursued a different course on any or all the points we have mentioned ; we merely state the facts to show that we are neither ultra-reformirs nor the slaves of any party. On every subject we act on the decision of our own unbiased opinion, honestly formed, and we claim therefore the credit of having made the exposure of MR. OLIVER, and the spy system, purely on public and patriotic grounds.

We have the satisfaction to conclude this article, by staing a fact, that will be haied with pleasure by every real friend to social order: Since Mr. Oliver left Yorkshire, perfect tranquiility has been restored. The County was never more peaceable. The 13th light dragoons, who had been brought into the West Riding, under an apprehension of an insurrectiorary rising, have returned to their quarters at York, and the nightly military patrole has been discontinued. In a word, we are as tranquil now the spies have disappeared, as we were before they came amongst us. The exciting cause has been withdrawn, and the effect has ceased.

On account of the lateness of the hour. tno person was it, attendance at the Secretary of State's Office, and no Magistrate being sitting, hle was lodged in the House of Correction.

THE HUDDERSFIELD INSURRECTION

An inflated and highly exaggerated account of the state of the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield, during the past month, has been published in the Leeds Intelligencer, and copied into the London Ministerial papers. Such a publication, on the eve of the trial at York, we hold to be extremely reprehensible, and must, as far as it is believed, have a tendency to prejudice the minds of the jury appointed to sit in judgement upon the lives of the accused. To assert in a public print before the trials come on, and of coorse on *ex parte* evidence, that the object of the prisoners was " massacre," and that their plans were to be consummated by " plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent," is to prejudge their cause, and to deprive these untortunate men of the benefit of that salutary maxim of the English law, which holds every man to be innocent till a jury of his countrymen has pronounced him guilty. Without pretenting to be at all in the secrets of the insurgents, we must say, we have too favourable an opinion of our species and of our countrymen, to believe that any numerous body of themn in a particular neighbourhood, could be brought to be the actors in a sedition, that was to inflict " massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage," upon their neighbours, " to a fearful extent." The intention of the insurgents, as far as we can learn, was to effect a " bloodless revolution," and the purpose of seizing and *disarming* the military, as stated is the accoun before us, seems to favour that supposition. That a bloodliess revolution could have been effected, is, to be sure, a supposition too gross to be entertained by any set of men of common understanding ; but Mr. Oliver, it seems, had the address to persuade the leaders that a project of this kind was practicable, and his dupes were so utterly ignorant as to adopt the absurdity. This fact may serve to shew of what kind of materials the Huddersfield branch of the conspiracy was formed. How many men and boys (for there was, it seems, a considerable proportion of the latter) assembled at *Folly*-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th, we cannot learn with any degree of certainty, but some estimate may be formed of their strength from the fact, that a detachment of newly-raised Yeomanry Cavalry put to flight and entirely dispersed the insurgent army ! while the only blood that flowed on the occasion on either side, was the blood of a horse, and the only other mark of violence inflicted was, as the Intelligencer states, the mark of a bail which struck a deserted house ! We do not wish to speak with levity of a proceeding which every friend to his country must condemn, but when we see a local act of popular violence, exaggerated to the bulk of a wide spreading insurrection, we feel it to be our duty to remove the deception, by lowering down the colouring to the standard of truth.

We have hitherto cautiously abstained from entering into the details of the violent proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield on the night of the 8th of June, satifying ourselves with stating from time to time the committals of the prisoners to the County gaol ; and this course we should have pursued, leaving the facts to be developed upon the trials, had not the exaggerated statements made in the Intelligencer induced us to depart from that determination. It now, however, becomes proper to state, that ever since the year 1812, when the Luddite system prevailed in Yorkshire, and raged more especially in the South-western plots of this Riding, there has been considerable irritation existing in the minds of some of the lower classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. This disposition, the extreme distress suffered by the labouring part of the community during the past year, tended materially to increase. For a time, the hope of Parliamentary Reform allayed the public dissatisfaction, by affording some prospect of relief, and petitions for that purpose wvere drawn up and signed very generally; but no sooner was the Bill for the suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act passed into a law, then hope gave place to despair; and soon after, a number of designing men, seizing the opportunity, did not hesitate to inculcate the opinion, that nothing short of a revolution could terminate the general suffering. Of these pestilent characters, the notorious Mr. Oliver was one of the principal ; and we have the authority of the wife of one of the persons mentioned in the Intelligencer as a principal conspirator (George Dawson), delivered in the presence of three respectabie witnesses, for saying that as long since as nearly two months ago, Oliver was in communication with the ring-leaders of the sedition, and that on one occasion he was a visitor at Dawson's house. On the same authority we state, that Mr. Oliver had held conferences with George Taylor, the leader of the mal-content forces, on the night of the 8th of June, and it is known that both Dawson and Taylor have since absconded. How Oliver conducted himself in his visits to Huddersfield, may be collected from the testimony of Dawson's wife, who says, that one morning, while she was at breakfast at Dawson's house, Oliver, among other inflammatory conversation, said -" They are all in readiness, in London. There is no occasion for bloodshed. We have only to seize the military and disarm them, and the thing is done." He added, that he had been concerned with Despard ;  that just before the Colonel and his associates were apprehended, he was going into a private room with them, but recollecting that he had a little business of his own to transact, he stepped out. and had not been gone half an hour, before they were all taken.

Under this kind of excitation, it is no wonder that the persons to whom such conversation was addressed, began to form traitorous designs, or rather perhaps, to cherish hopes that designs already formed might be realized. The leaders, it appears, held frequent communications with the subordinate agents. The plot thickened daily. A considerable number of men in the lowest ranks of life became involved in the conspiracy. Sunday night, the 8th of June, was appointed for the rising. Two or three hundred persons, it is said, many of them boys from 14 to 20 years, assembled at a place bearing the appropriate name of *Folly*-hall-bridge. Taylor placed himself at their head, and at 12 o'clock, the moment for commnencing operations, this fanatic addressed his followers in these terms " Now, my lads, all England is in arms-our liberties are secureâ€” the rich will be poor, and the poor will be rich." To this rabble a detachment of six Yeomanry Cavalry was at first opposed, and we verily believe that had the cavalry , small as their number were, thought proper to advance, they would have routed the insurgents, They however judged it prudent to retreat, and being reinforced by a body of their comrades, they returned to witness the dispersion of an unorganized mob that had been drawn together, some by actual force, others by an idle curiosity, and others, no doubt, with criminal designs. In the mean time, a sort of under-plot was acting, and a number of marauders were passing about the neighbourhood, forcing the peaceable inhabitants to open their doors and surrender their fire-arms. At Honley, they broke into the house of Mr. Armitage, who observed that one of the bandits seemed better dressed than his associates, " that he was not like one of this country-men, and that he talked like a londoner." 

The Magistrates, who appear to have displayed a more than ordinary share of vigour, soon found means to discover and to arrest a number of the persons engaged in these criminal excesses, and twenty-four of them have been committed to York Castle, to take their trials at the Assizes, which commence this day, while about half that number still remain in confinement in the prison at Huddersfield. It is much to be regretted that the persons apprehended, and about to be put upon their trials, have for the most part, been, at most, merely the dupes of thse leaders of this miserable conspiracy, atid that the instigators, including Mr. Oliver, the London delegate, have been suffered to escape.

*Mr. Oliver's Cyper.*â€”  It appears from the evidence of the principal witness for the Crown given before the Lord Lieutenant and the Magistrates at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th of June, that Mr. Oliver corresponded with his dupes in cypher, and that one of the mottos used by him for that purpose wasâ€”  *"The Old Mother is sick, and expects all her sons to arm."*

MINISTERIAL JUSTIFICATION OF OLIVER

*(From the Times)*

In the House of Commons on Friday, in a debate on the State of the Nation, Mr. H Addington said, he had risen principally with a view of doing justice to a much injured individualâ€”he meant Mr. Oliver. (*hear, hear*.) Within this fortnight two magistrates within the county of York, who had received an unfavourabie impression as to the conduct of Mr. Oliver in the country, had requested that he might undergo an examination at the office for the Home Department. One of these magistrates came from Yorkshire on purpose. and the other was a much respected member of that House, whose absence he regretted, as that gentleman would have corroborated the statement he had to make. These magistrates took the examination ; the individual who brought the charge was confronted with Mr. Oliver, and the result was, that both magistrates declared themselves competely satisfied that the charge was false. that there was not indeed the smallest foundation for supposing that he had provoked the insurrection in the country; and that there had been nothing blameable either in the language or conduct of the person thus accused. It was his duty to make this statement, because the facts could only be made known to the house through hiim. Mr. Oliver had taken no part in any plots. He came to the Home-office in the beginning of April, and offered information which he considered beneficial to the country, but which he had not obtained by being implicated in any conspiracy. He asked no reward, and never received a shilling from Government, except what served to defray his travelling expenses. Informaion had been transmitted to the Home-office, that the insurreetion which had been attempted was to break out on the 9th or 10th of June. All the magistrates in the disturbed districts. who had written on the subject, agreed in fixing upon the same date. The duty required of Mr. Oliver was to go to the country to ascertain whether this report was correct, and to transmit to the Home-office what information he mighlt collect. This, it was supposed, would save time to the magistrates and the information, it was thought, would be more speedily collected than by relying solely on the separate communications of the magistrates. He carried letters of recommendation to five or six magistrates, and was ordered to return by the 5th of June, as by that time it was necessary that the Executive Govermnent should be prepared with the precautions against the imminent danger which threatened the peace of the country. Mr. Oliver, however, stayed by accident a day or two beyond the limited time; and he had himself written a letter to hasten his return. When Mr. Oliver came to the office and offered to give evidence, he declared he did so in the hope of saving the country; and he was fully persuaded of his sincerity.

*Mr. Barham* doubted much whether the country, or even that House, would concur in the judgement of acquittal which the secret tribunal to which the Right Hon. Gent. referred had pronounced on the spy Oliver. Those who had not the advantage of having been present at the secret tribunal, must decide on the facts already within their knowledge. For his part, he should declare that his judgment could not be on the favourable side, when he recollected what he had heard from a departed Right Honourable friend of his, whose memory had been so justly eulogized that night. Mr. Ponsonby (who it will be recollected was a member of the Secret Committee) had told him, that he believed, in his conscience, the insurrection would not have taken place had it not been for Oliver. He had been so struck with this observation, that he asked his Right Hon. Friend to repeat what he had stated, and he did repeat it.

*Frame-breaking*.-The *Gazette* of Tuesday night contains the Proclamation of the Prince Regent, offering an amnesty to the persons concerned in the offence of frame-breaking, except in the case of the outrage at Loughborough; the intention of issuing which was announced by Lord Sidmouth on the discussion of the Frame-breaking Bill in the House of Lords. After alluding to the increase of punishment annexed to this offence by the Act recently passed, and expressing a hope that persons will thus be deterred from the future colmmission of such offences, the Proclamation proceedsâ€”

" We do hereby promise and declare, that every person who hath committed any offence against the form of the Statute made in the fifty-fourth year of his Majesty's reign, for the punisirnuent of persons destroying stocking or lace-frames, but hath not yet been charge therewith, and who shall, previous to the firsi day of September next ensuing, appear before some Justice of the Peace or Magistrate and declare such his offence, and when, where, and by whom the same was committed, shall receive his Majesty's most gracious pardon for such offence, and that no confession so made by any such person shall be given in evidence in any Court, or in any case whatever; provided nevertheless, that nothing herein contained shall extend to the offence so committed at Loughborough as afore said, nor to any other offence, except such as may hav been committed contrary to the said Statute made in the fifty-fourth year aforesaid."
