https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1817/feb/21/habeas-corpus-suspension-bill
HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.
HL Deb 21 February 1817 vol 35 cc491-2
Lord Sidmouth said, that he was prepared, on coming down to the House that day, to have gone fully into the subject itself, and to have communicated the grounds on which his majesty's government felt it imperative to recommend the measure now about to be submitted to the consideration of their lordships. From the wish expressed by a number of the members of that House, he was willing to defer the discussion on the bill he then held in his hand until the second reading, which he should fix for Monday, at the same time communicating his intention of forwarding it through its various stages on that night. He then moved, that a bill intituled "An act to empower his majesty to secure and detain such persons as his majesty shall suspect are conspiring against his person and government," be now read a first time.
