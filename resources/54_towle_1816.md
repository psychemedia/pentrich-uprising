# The (Second) Trial of James Towle

Back in 1814, James Towle, a framework-knitter from New Basford, had been charged with, but found not guilty of, forcing entry into the house of his neighbour, Mr. Garton, and breaking several of his frames. It seems that Garton believed Towle to be a Luddite: he had been heard several times saying that if his frames were ever broken, he would make sure Towle was taken up for it, and by this evidence his veracity as the leading prosecution witness was damaged.

Two years later, in the June 1816, the disturbances had started up again. And Towle, the Luddite, was back in business.

PROVINCIAL NEWS

THE LUDDITES

We are informed that the Luddites in the vicinity of Nottingham have again resumed their mischievous practices of frame-breaking. The following is an extract of a letter from Nottingham, dated Sunday last, on this unpleasant subject:—

"I am sorry to inform you, that the system of frame-breaking recommenced this morning about two o'clock: nineteen lace-frames were broken at New Radford, near this town, working to Waynman; nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different people. The cause assigned for destroying these frames is, that he had just sold nine to the workmen, to be worked out by stopping one-third of the work. There was an armed party, upwards of thirty, and sentinels placed at different avenues, whilst the work of destruction went forward. I have just seen W————, and, from what he says, there are great hopes they will be found out; but one of our magistrates has behaved very ill, in refusing to grant a warrant, being Sunday. There will be no security for property in our business, or any other, until the law is clearly defined, that the county, hundred, or district, *shall* make good all property wantonly or maliciously destroyed: and as the system is spreading to so many parts of the kingdom, we are surprised that the Home Secretary of State should not see it would take away every motive of revenge against personal property."

The system of frame-breaking re-commenced in the neighbourhood of Nottingham on Sunday morning about two o'clock; nineteen lace-frames were broken at New Radford working for Mr. Waynman: nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different people. The cause assigned for destroying these frames is, that he had just sold nine to the workmen, to be worked out by stopping one third of the work. There was an armed party of upwards of thirty ruffians, and sentinels were placed at different avenues whilst the work of destruction went forward.— A magistrate of Nottingham is charged in the London papers with most extraordinary conduct, in refusing to grant a warrant against some persons believed to be part of the offenders, because it was Sunday!

## Attack on Heathcote and Boden's Mill, Loughborough

At the start of July, there was a concerted attack on Heathcote and Boden's lace manufactory in Loughborough. In the course of the attack, one of the guards posted in the factory was shot and wounded.

Evening Mail - Wednesday 03 July 1816

The manufacturing labourers in Nottingham and its vicinity, we are sorry to say, have often betrayed a greater impatience of temporary misfortune than others of their station in life. For this unhappy disposition they are indebted to the prevalence of democratic and disorganizing principles among their neighbours of somewhat superior rank and education. In this part of the country the desperate conspiracy of the Luddites took its rise. A gang of similar miscreants, we are informed, entered the premises of Mr. Heathcote, at Loughborough, on Saturday last, for the avowed purpose of breaking to pieces the whole of his lace-machinery, on account of having learnt that this gentleman intended to reduce the price of labour. The villains were all disguised, and mostly armed. The first person they met was the guard, stationed according to nightly custom watch and protect the property. Him they ordered to lie down with his face to the ground, and not to observe their motions or molest them at his peril. The guard, being faithful to his trust, refused to obey, and was shot dead immediately. Mr. Heathcote employed two sets of men—one to work night, and the other day. Twelve of the latter were at work, whom the murderers seized, and commanded instantly to fall their faces: the men, with the recent example of cruelty before their eyes, did not hesitate to obey; and in the course of one hour from that time these ruffians destroyed, in machinery and goods, property to the amount of 15,000l.
```

Just after midnight, thirty or so men, with twice as many more outside, posted as sentries, or acting as patrols calling out to homeowners to stay inside, had gained entry to a room at the rear of Heathcote and Boden's lace mill. Two months earlier, wages at the factory had been lowered, provoking a general turn-out, although many of the workers had then relented and returned. Encountering three of the factory men, one of whom, John Asher, picked up a pistol and pointed it at the Luddites. The Luddites fired first, hitting Asher in the back of his head. Another of the factory men attempted to escape, before the three of them were forced to lay on the ground, with a guard stood over them. The machine-breakers entered further into the factory and then set about *their* work — of destruction. As they made their way through the factory, any other factory workers they came across were similarly forced to lie on the ground, with additional guards posted over them.

Over the course of forty minutes os so, the attackers set about breaking the machines. At one point, all of them stopping briefly to listen for sounds of trouble below, before starting up their activity again. With fifty or more machines broken, the lace ripped, and some even burned — when the flames approached one of the prostrate men on the ground, and he moved to get out of the way, he was kicked back down — they called on the factorymen to divulge the details of any other factories working machines under price, but they received no answer. Telling the factory men to remain as they were for at least ten minutes, the marauders left, apologising to the shot man, Asher, on the way out, and hoping that he would get better soon.

As the Luddites regrouped following the attack, they counted off to ensure they had all made it out safely, shots were fired, and they set off again into the night.

LOUGHBOROUGH FRAME-BREAKING

We have this week the painful task of recording an outrage of the frame-breakers, which, very far, exceeds any thing of the kind that has ever before happened, since enormities of this description first spread terror amongst us in March, 1811; and, well-aware, from the rumours that have been afloat for several days, that our readers would feel the utmost anxiety to learn the particulars of this deplorable catastrophe, we have spared no pains in endeavouring to satisfy them as much as we possibly could, *"neither extenuating, nor setting down aught in malice."* About a quarter-post twelve o'clock, on Friday night, or rather on Saturday morning last, a number of men, perhaps about thirty, some of whom were armed and disguised entered a small room, called the casting shop, immediately attached to the rear part Messrs. Heathcoat and Boden's lace-factory, (formerly Mr Douglass's worsted factory,) situate directly at the entrance into the town of Loughborough from Ashby-de-la-Zouch. In this small room were John Asher, Thomas Hyman, and John Wehsler, three of the men belonging to the factory, the former of whom snatched up a pistol, (kept in the room for the purpose of defence), and pointed it at the Luddites, as they were coming in at the door, but it did not go off. Some one them, in return, instantly fired at Asher, apparently with a blunderbuss, and wounded him in the back of his head, which either caused him to fall, or he was otherwise knocked down. Hyman, being also at the same moment laid prostrate by his side, and Webster, who got out of doors, in the confusion, to try to escape, was quickly brought back again and placed along-side of his two companions. Sufficient guards were then put over the three, and the residue of the gang, with lights their bands, proceeded, without loss of time, through the large room, called the setting up room, to the bottom of the stair-case, where meeting with a youth named Ambrose Woodford, they knocked down, placed a guard over him. as they had done to the others, and then rushed up stairs into the first floor, which is divided into three parts, or shops, containing altogether twenty-three frames, the whole whereof they broke to pieces, having previously secured, in one of the said three shops, James Powel, (commonly called uncle,) William Soars, and John North, in the same manner as their companions below. Ned's band then directed their attention to the large room above, in which were thirty frames and five men, viz. Joseph Sherwin, Samuel Street, William Squires, John Langham, and, Thomas Smith, the first of whom expressed to his associates, a determination to resist the entrance of the invaders into their room, which determination was probably overhead by the latter, for they advanced to the foot the stairs with terrific boldness, a stern voice calling out, *"advance with the blunderbusses—more blunderbusses here."* Sherwin's comrades, now fearing that his opposition might endanger the lives of the whole five, prevailed upon him to change his intention. and let them come quietly, which they then did without delay. No sooner was this accomplished, than the said five were imperiously commanded to prostrate themselves with their faces to the floor, and not to look about them lest death should he their portion, and at the same time guards were fixed over them, as in the former instances of the like nature. This preliminary being settled, demolition itself was then let loose, and to it went the furies.

After toiling for the space of perhaps seven or eight minutes, they all stopped on a sudden, as if to listen whe-all *(sic)* was right below,—the strictest silence reigned for a few seconds: and afterwards one of them vociferated, *All's well, Ned Ludd do your duty well— its a Waterloo job by G—d,"* when instantly they renewed the work of havoc as before, and continued it also for about the same space of time, thus finishing the destructive scene, except their breaking two incomplete frames, in the setting-up room, as they returned through it upon their retreat. Just before quitting the upper room, one of the Luddites said aloud to his comrades, *"Ned go round and see that you have done your duty well,"* and almost immediately afterwards, the prostrate five were thus addressed, *"Now men, if you can tell us of any machines that are working under price if it be one or hundred miles off, we will go and break them."* Receiving a negative to this question, they directly quitted the factory, enjoining the men belonging to it, with terrible threats, not to stir for the space of ten minutes, and offering to shake hands with Asher, the wounded man; telling him withal that they hoped he would soon get better, or words to that effect; and we are happy to inform the public that he is now quite out of danger, and fast approaching complete recovery. They have not only thus destroyed the machines, but even the lace that happened to be upon the respective rollers is mostly hacked to pieces. In one instance they tore it away and set fire to it upon the floor, the flames whereof coming near to Street, he shifted a little; whereupon one of them gave him a kick, and bid him lie still as the fire would not hurt him; Squires too, who once rather changed his position to avoid danger, received a violent blow near his left eye; and Langham, and North were likewise struck from somewhat similar motives. In fact, it seemed a particular maxim with them, as we have before remarked, the deterring as much as possible any one from having a glimpse of their proceedings. Independent of the supposed number of nearly thirty who were actively committing these excesses in the interior of the factory, it is confidently believed that there were not less than fifty or sixty others stationed on the outside in the manner of sentinels or patroles, in every direction, and even along the Mill-street, to within a few yards of the very Market place of the town. Some of these patroles called aloud, warning the inhabitants to keep in their beds, and not to exhibit any lights; in disobedience of which, one person, who endeavoured to go out amongst them, had eight panes directly broken, in one of his windows, and was threatened with death if he did not keep within. About a dozen panes were also broken in the windows of the factory.

According to the best information we can collect, this daring outrage occupied the space of about forty minutes, and some of the neighbours go so far as to say that the posse were headed by a man on horseback, who halted his men, and called over his *numerical* list, when they had quitted the premises about 200 yards, as if to ascertain if any were missing; and that shortly afterwards several shots were fired; either denoting triumph, or by way of defiance as they eventually marched away. We have not heard of any thing having been carried off except some fire arms belonging to the factory. On the other hand, we understand, they left two of their own ramrods behind them. It is very difficult, at present, to form any estimate of the amount of the damages, even by the proprietors themselves; we have however been told, by an experienced workman, that he thinks each of the fifty-three complete frames will require, on an average, 80*l.* to put them in the same state again; this, of course, would make 4240*l.*—to which if we add, 60*l.* more, for the injury to the two incomplete frames to make round numbers, the account would then stand at 4300*l.* Thus, even admitting it to be any thing near the truth, a serious sum; and yet, it is scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with the general loss: in the first place to the firm by the great delay to their business, whilst the frames are repairing; and to the next place, to near four hundred men, women, and children, thrown out employ. It may not be amiss to add, that about two months ago, the workmen at the factory received notice that their wages would all be lowered, which, caused, what is called, a general turn-out.— Some of them however soon relented this, and went in again at the reduced prices, whilst others were not permuted that privilege. These proceedings had engendered considerable discontent, and it is not improbable, but they may have had some influence with the perpetrators of the deed in question. Certain it is that until this circumstance very few manufactories, of equal extent, were carried on, in this part of the kingdom, where the masters men more cordially accorded than they did at this. The Magistrates of the division have almost incessantly been since occupied in investigating the affair, and endeavouring to bring to justice the authors of it. The town crier even went round with his bell on Sunday warning the inn-keepers against keeping their houses open, later than nine o'clock in the evening. Six men, having at different intervals, been taken up, on suspicion, one of who has since been set at liberty; three remain in custody at Loughborough, & the other two were yesterday at noon sent under an escort from that town to Leicester. Some implements supposed to have been used in destroying the machines, have been seized, and are likewise in the possession of the constables employed by the Magistrates in this business. The Magistrates and police-officers in Nottingham, have also been very active, and many houses in this town have been searched on the occasion. A reward of five hundred guineas is offered in the London Gazette, for such information as will lead to the conviction of the perpetrators.— *Nottingham Review*

The two men brought to the County Gaol on Thursday, on suspicion of being concerned in the transaction, are named— Benjamin Badder and John Slater. Another man, charged with the same offence, was also committed yesterday.

Following the attack, three men were taken up: Benjamin Badder, John Slater, and Jas (James) Towle.

Leicester Journal - Friday 12 July 1816

In the commitments to the County Gaol during last week, were two men Benjamin Badder and John Slater, both of Nottingham, on suspicion of being concerned in the late attack upon Mr Heathcote's manufactory at Loughborough.—Jas Towle, of Basford, near Nottingham, has also been committed to the said Gaol, charged with being concerned in the said offence. Luddism has very justly been attributed to the influence of those democratic and disorganising principles which have very extensively prevailed among many of the higher classes in the countries where the stocking and lace manufactory is carried on. The charge we believe to be too well founded. Democratic newspapers, and democratic principles, have had there a very wide circulation, and many tradesman and manufacturers, instead of counteracting them, have lent their aid to give them authority. It ts true they did not expect to have their frames broken, their property destroyed, and their servants murdered. They indulged their own political theories, and wished to realize their own schemes of reform and revolution on those above them. But they have had experience, in the Luddite system, of their own principle carried into effect against themselves; and if the innocent had not, in many instances, like the present, suffered with the guilty, and that demoralising principles were in the lower classes, we should not be sorry for their claims and sufferings. These are the genuine effects of the interest the lower classes in many manufacturing places have been taught by their superiors to take, first, in the French revolution, and then in the character and exploits of Bonaparte.

On Tuesday morning 36 Colliers passed through this Town, dragging an empty waggon, and professing to be on their way home into Staffordshire; three of them waited upon the Magistrates, requesting relief, and stated, that they had been as far as Uppingham with a load of coals, where they had sold them, and had been prevailed on by some Gentleman of that place, to return, after having collected upwards of £5, to defray their expences. —The Magistrates told them they were truly sorry for their distressed situation, but that the means they were pursuing, to obtain relief, by going about the country, in bodies, and begging, were highly improper, and could not be tolerated; that they were, in fact, in a state of vagrancy, and could only be relieved in that character; they were also told, that while the Magistrates felt it a duty, which they most cheerfully performed, to attend to the just claims of the very numerous inhabitants of their own Town, who are now out of employ, it was equally their duty to repress the illegal proceedings of those men who had an equal right to relief from their own parishes; they were desired to proceed through the Town, without begging, and cautioned against the consequences of disobeying this order. It is but justice, however, to the men, to say, that they conducted themselves with the most peaceable and respectful demeanor.

Summary announcements of the renewed outbreaks were also reported in the London newspapers.

Discontents.— We have not this week to record any fresh outrages in the midland counties;—but very great and serious alarm is excited at the long continued existence, in the very heart of the kingdom, of that secret association known by the name of the *Luddites*, whose destructive operations the utmost vigilance of the Executive has not been able to prevent. What excites, perhaps, more alarm than any thing else, is the excellence of their organization, which could not be exceeded by the most regular military force. At the late outrage at Loughborough, independently of the supposed number of nearly 30, who were actively concerned in committing these excesses in the interior of the factory, it is confidently believed that there were not less than 50 or 60 others stationed on the outside, in the manner of sentinels or patroles, in every direction, and even along the Mill-street, to within a very few yards of the market place of Loughborough. Some of these patroles called aloud, warning, the inhabitants to keep in their beds, and not to exhibit any lights.—(Carlisie Journal.)

## Towle on Trial Again

The trial of Towle, and the others, came on at the Leicester Summer Assizes in August.

Starting and seven in the morning, and not finishing till 10 at night, Towle's defence once again seems to have been reliant on convincing the Jury that he had an alibi. But various admissions he appeared to have made to a police constable both prior to, and in the immediate aftermath, of the attack on Heathcote and Boden's factory, seem to have helped the Jury come to their verdict.

A large number of constables were also sworn in to preserve the peace, along with a troop of Hussars ready to step if an attempt was made to release the prisoners. The gentleman of the town also took it upon themselves to arm themselves with clubs to provide an escort for the judge to and from the Castle.

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Tuesday 13 August 1816

TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES AT LEICESTER. Leicester, Aug. 10. —The trial of Towle, Slater, and Badder, charged with feloniously entering the lace manufactory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden at Loughborough, on the night of the 28th June, came on this morning, at seven o'clock, before the Hon. Baron Graham, when, after upwards of fifty witnesses had been examined for and against the prisoners (which occupied the Court more than fourteen hours), the Jury found Towle Guilty; and Slater and Badder— Not Guilty.

Several witnesses swore that Towle was at work at four o'clock on the Saturday morning, and one also swore he saw him in his (Towle's) house at about 12 the night before, thereby making it appear rather improbable that he should have been at Loughborough on the night in question; but a Nottingham Police Officer, having positively sworn that Towle informed him, a few days before the outrage in question took place, that there would be a *job* on Friday night, if not put off;" and also, that he met Towle on the Saturday morning, at six o'clock, at Beeston, near Nottingham; and that in reply to a question put by the Officer, he admitted that he was very unwell and fatigued, which appeared to be the case—this, coupled with the circumstance of his having told the same Officer, when coming down to Red-hill, (the place where criminals were formerly executed), on his road to gaol, that he would have to ride *back to that spot*, and desiring the Officer to inform his wife to beg his body, and let it be placed alongside Bamford, who, it will be recollected, was shot in the act of frame-breaking; and several other equally suspicious circumstances, tended to overrule the *alibi* attempted to be set up, and thus to fix guilt upon a man whose firmness on receiving the awful sentence, after standing 14 hours heavily ironed, deserved a better fate.

Never in the memory of the oldest inhabitant did a trial excite such a degree of interest, mixed with apprehension for the public peace, as this. Upwards of 800 persons, among whom were some of the most respectable tradesmen of the town, armed with the oid-fasnioned weapon of defence, viz. the constable's stave, with the Mayor at their head, were called out by our worthy High Sheriff, C. W. Pochin, Esq. of Berkby, whose purely constitutional notions of preserving the public peace are not unworthy of imitation, in a day when military display is so prevailing.

ANOTHER ACCOUNT. Leicester, Aug;. 11. —The following brief account of the important trial of the Luddites, continued in our County Gaol, for destroying Heathcote and Boden's machinery, commenced yesterday morning at seven o'clock, and lasted until ten in the evening. Judge Graham was three hours in summing up the evidence; and the Jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty against Towle, who is supposed to be one of the chiefs of this desperate association. The two other prisoners, Slater and Badder, were acquitted. Seventy of their partizans from Loughborough and Nottingham came to prove an *alibi*, but the evidence for the prosecution was so strong against Towle, that all they had to say had no weight with the Jury. Serjeant Vaughan was leading Counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Denman for the prisoners. Serjeant Vaughan's address to the Jury was one of the most able ever delivered in a Court of Justice. It was feared a serious disturbance would take place if the prisoners were found guilty, but the precautions taken were so good as to set at defiance the machinations of the disaffected. About 500 constables were sworn in to preserve the peace; and the Gentlemen of the town, with our worthy Chief Magistrate at their head, armed with clubs, escorted the Judge to and from the Castle. There were also two or three troops of the 15th Hussars in the villages a mile two from the town, ready at a minute's notice, if an attempt had been made to rescue the prisoners on their return from the Castle, which was fully expected, according to the information the Mayor had received, and which was very probable, considering the late hour at which the prisoners were brought back to gaol.
```

In the trial itself, Towle's defence was based on having an alibi, as provided by the testimony of several witnesses who had claimed to see him working in the early hours of the Saturday morning, too far away from Loughborough for him to have participated in the attack. But a couple of encounters with a policeman, and the remarks that had passed between them, were to prove Towle's downfall.

LEICESTER Assizes.—These assizes closed on Tuesday. *James Towle*, charged with breaking into the manufactory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, at Loughboro', on Friday night the 28th of June, and, with other persons, breaking upwards of 50 lace-frames, was found *guilty*, sentenced to *death*, and left for execution. *John Slater* and *Benj. Badder*, charged with the same offence, were acquitted.—(More than 50 witnesses were examined on these trials, which occupied the Court for fourteen hours. Several witnesses swore that Towle was at work at four o'clock on the Saturday morning, and one also swore that he saw him in his (Towle's) house about 12 the night before, thereby making it appear rather improbable that he should have been at Loughborough on the night in question; but a Nottingham Police Officer, having positively sworn that Towle informed him, a few days before the outrage in question took place, that "there would be *job* on Friday night, if not put off;" and also, that he met Towle on the Saturday morning, at six o'clock, at Beeston, near Nottingham; and that in reply to a question put by the Officer, he admitted that he was very unwell and fatigued, which appeared to the case—this, coupled with the circumstance of his having told the same Officer, when coming down Red-hill, (the place where criminals were formerly executed,) on his road to gaol, that he would have to *ride back to that spot*, and desiring the Officer to inform his wife to beg his body, and let it be placed alongside Bamford, who, it will be recollected, was shot in the act of frame-breaking; and several other equally suspicious circumstances, tended to overrule the *alibi* attempted be set up. The firmness of Towle on receiving the awful sentence, after standing 14 hours heavily ironed, was extraordinary, and worthy of a man less infamous.)
```

Perhaps mindful of the scenes that had surrounded the trial at Nottingham earlier in the month of Glover and Chettle after the attack on the frames of Benjamin Topham, et al., a considerable turn out of men armed with clubs assembled to provide an escort for the judge, and a strong message that the Jury were not to be threatened or otherwise intimidated.

Also appears as: Stamford Mercury - Friday 23 August 1816

Saturday morning presented a most interesting and grateful spectacle; the violent and disgraceful proceedings which are stated to have occurred during the late Assizes at Nottingham, and which were said to have intimidated the Jury, from a conscientious discharge of their duty, induced a large portion of the most respectable inhabitants of this town, to rally round the Constituted Authorities, and give their aid towards the administration of Justice. At 6 o'clock between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange, each receiving a white wand and a club, and headed by the Chief Magistrate, proceeded in fours to the Judges lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street, after the Judges had entered their Carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in. It was soon after 7 o'clock when the prisoners (Towle, Slater, and Badder,) were put to the Bar, and the business continued without any interruption whatever, until half past nine in the evening. After having passed the different sentences upon the prisoners, the Judges were reconducted to their lodgings, in the same manner in which they came. The Chief Magistrate and his party then returned to the Castle, and escorted the Prisoners to Gaol, where having safely deposited them, the assemblage broke up. During the whole of the day, (notwithstanding there was a large assemblage from Nottingham and its environs) the greatest order and decorum were preserved— thus proudly showing to our neighbours, that when *the body is sound at heart*, turbulence, anarchy, and disorder will never prevail. If the due administration of Justice is to be wantonly interrupted by threats and lawless violence, then indeed is there an end of every thing that is sacred in the Constitution! Nottingham may from hence take a salutary lesson, and by a total change of manners and *principles*, again class among the most loyal and best of his Majesty's subjects.

The learned Judge, (Mr. Baron Graham,) was two hours and a quarter in summing up the evidence, taking a clear, distinct, and comprehensive view of the whole particularly as it affected Towle, when after a consultation of a few minutes only, the Jury returned a verdict of guilty against him, and acquitted Slater, (the prosecution against Badder, the other Prisoner, having been previously withdrawn,) the Judge immediately afterwards passed sentence of death upon Towle, who had a determined aspect throughout, and received the awful sentence without any apparent emotion whatever.

Seventy one witnesses in favour of the Prisoners were brought to prove Alibi's.

Around about the same time, the civic authorities in Nottingham were themselves were not just being chastised, but also fined, for the poor public behaviour that had been demonstrated surrounding that earlier trial.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 24 August 1816

We regret to observe that the pernicious spirit of Luddism still exists in Leicester, Nottingham, Lincoln, and other manufacturing counties. At the late Nottingham Assizes several desperate characters of this gang were tried, but acquitted. During the trials, says the Lincoln Paper of the 16th instant, Mr. Justice Graham, who tried the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going to, and returning from Court, and many members of the Court were also grossly insulted. There is no member of the Bench more distinguished for mildness, urbanity, and genuine humanity, than Mr. Justice Graham; and it must fill every person with indignation who hears of this infamous conduct.

We understand that a fine of £500 has been set on the county, for the injurious example it has afforded in the excesses by which it has been distinguished. This outrageous behavior will have its effect; it will unite all respectable and peaceable persons in the determination of resisting and putting down such dangerous insolence. At Leicester Assizes, which succeeded those of Nottingham, a large portion of the most respectable inhabitants of Leicester rallied round the constituted authorities, and gave their aid towards the faithful execution of justice. Between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange; each received a white wand and a club, and headed by the chief Magistrate, they proceeded in fours to the Judges' lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street; after the Judges had entered their carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in. One desperado named Towle was convicted, and sentenced to suffer death. During the whole day, notwithstanding there was a large assemblage from Nottingham and its environs, the greatest order and decorum was preserved—thus showing to our neighbours, says the Leicester Journal, that when THE BODY IS SOUND AT HEART, turbulence, anarchy, and disorder will never prevail. If the due administration of justice is to be wantonly and seditiously interrupted by threats and violence, then indeed there is an end of everything that is sacred to the Constitution. Nottingham, and all other places, may from hence take a salutary lesson.

LEICESTER.

Trial of Towle, Slater, and Badder.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1816.

About seven o'clock this morning, the trial of the above-named persons came on before the Hon. Baron Graham. The indictment charged James Towle with having, on the night of the 28th June, or early on the morning of the 29th of same month, entered the premises of John Heathcoat and John Boden, of Loughborough, and having discharged a pistol loaded with a ball or slugs at John Asher, with intent to kill him the said John Asher; and John Slater and Benjamin Badder, with being accessary thereto.

JOHN BODEN is partner with John Heathcoat in a bobbin-net lace manufactory, at Loughborough; left the factory at eleven o'clock on Friday night, the 28th June last, when all was safe—six framesmiths, besides men who were at work and three other men as guards, were on the premises when witness left; there were fifty-five frames upon three floors, viz. in setting-up shop, two unfinished; first floor, twenty-three; second ditto, thirty—was alarmed and apprised of the outrage at a little before two, but did not go to the factory till about five o'clock, when he found the whole of the machines and some of the windows broken—witness saw some blood in a box on the floor, and some splashed against the wall; the greater part of the lace upon the frames was quite destroyed; estimates the injury done at 7 or £8,000—have been prevented going on with their business ever since. Witness dispatched Benjamin Silvester, Joseph Sherwin, and Cumberland, the Loughborough Constable, to Nottingham Police-Office, that morning.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Balguy.*—When he left the place, about eleven o'clock, there might be eight or nine men in the factory besides the smiths—did not take particular notice of the exact number, nor of the persons of the workmen who were then present; he only knew one or two of them.

ELIZABETH SILVESTER said, her husband was overlooker of the smiths at Heathcoat and Boden's factory; went up stairs to bed; it was a quarter past twelve when she stepped into bed; lives in a house opposite and situate near, the factory, in Mill-street; she was alarmed "by a great muttering of talking," which was so loud, that it appeared to proceed from a considerable number of persons; her candle was not then put out; she got up, immediately opened the window, and looked out for a few moments, but saw nobody except a neighbour, (John Sour), who was standing at his own door, which is next to witness's; he went towards the factory; shortly after witness heard the same noise, and a whistle, with a threat, that if she did not put out her light, her brains will be blown out, when, being very much frightened, she retreated towards where the candle was; witness did not see whence they came; when there was a whistle, they seem to come from all roads, in great numbers; heard a gun discharged at her window; in the mean time, heard them say, "All's well!" and then whistled; thinks a gun was fired at Rushworth's house, which is opposite witness's, as she heard them threaten him in the same way as they did her; having left the house door unlocked, witness went down stairs to lock it, and being very much agitated, she fell down three steps; heard them say, "Fire through the key-hole," but did not hear them fire at her. Soon after, she heard the machines and some of the windows broken, and then a firing, which appeared to be at some distance. The frame-breaking did not continue more than half an hour by witness's watch, after which there seemed to be great numbers pacing the street, occasionally exclaiming, "All's well!" Heard somebody say, "Don't break windows, there is friend Kilburn's there," and also, "That all was done, and one man was killed." Thinks their feet move towards the Ashby Road; heard firing six or seven times, when all was over.

JOHN ASHER—is a framesmith and was in the employ of Messrs. Heathcoat and Boden on the 28th of June—was on guard that night as a watchman to the premises—watch ought to have consisted of five or six smiths but two were gone out—Thomas Ironman, Webster, and witness, were on duty, and Silvester and German were out, they had three pistols and a musket with a fixed bayonet—is not sure whether there was more—witness sat opposite the door in casting shop—was first disturbed at a quarter past twelve with a noise, and footsteps coming up the yard to the door, by hearing the report of a pistol, and directly after seeing three of four men stand in the door-way—witness took a pistol off the shelf pointed it at them and turned his head another way—when some one ran into the shop, and witness was shot in the back of the head and fell down insensible, but soon recovered his recollection, and found himself on his face under a bench, with his head adjoining Webster's shoulder and bleeding profusely—at this time heard them breaking machines—had one and sometimes two men placed over them as a guard, who threatened to blow their brains out if they looked up; after laying about twenty minutes, witness said, "I wish you would send for a doctor, or I shall bleed to death,"—there was no answer, but the man who guarded them, seemed to speak to another man on the outside. In ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, a man came from the yard to know how the wounded man was—he said "How are you," "Very bad," I replied. He then asked me if I could do a bit longer. I told him I could if he would not be long—he said he would not,—five minutes after they left the premises;—as they were going, one said to another, "shake hands with the wounded man"—Webster put his hand out and shaked hands—another man said, "that's not the man."—He then said—"Put *your* hand out" and shook hands with witness, who thinks the hand was a small one—witness was three weeks before he was well of the wound.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Balguy.*—Witness crawled home between two men—was much agitated when the men entered, so much so that he forgot to cock his pistol—is not certain who the person was first shook hands with him—nor can he say whether the person came from the yard or not.

MR. PALMER is a surgeon, at Loughborough; were sent for at twenty minutes past one—found Asher laying wounded on the floor in casting room; he had received a wound from a slug in back part of the head, which was afterwards extracted—[witness here produced it]—it had not penetrated the skull; Asher was three weeks or a month under his hands.

JOHN WEBSTER was a workman at Heathcoat and Boden's factory on the 28th June—at a quarter-past twelve was in the casting-shop, along with Asher and Ironman, expected some of their fellow workmen's return; witness was not above a yard from the door—there was a blazing fire and a candle burning when the assailants entered; it was a short-eight candle; the casting-shop is a small room—three came first; one of them a little man, rather before the other; the little man had a pistol in his hand, and passed witness's right hand, and went forward—witness attempted to escape from the premises, but was stopped at the door by several of the party, who surrounded him and presented pistols; three of them were put close to his head, while one man held an axe in the same position—the former saying, that if he moved, they would *blow* his brains out, and the latter, that he would *knock* them out—the man with the axe was a tall man; had light enough to see his face when looking up at the axe—is sure, quite sure, that Slater, the prisoner, is the man—hearing a pistol go off by witness's head, he gave up and lay down on his face, thinking resistance unavailing—witness observed Towle's features particularly, as he passed him—so much so, that he knew him again when he saw him—Towle passed as near to him as possible, so as not to touch him; he was only disguised by having an handkerchief over his chin, not so high as his mouth—did not particularly notice the third man, but he had some sort of a steel weapon in his hand—saw no firelock when first man entered, nor a long piece of any description, in any of their hands; there were two muskets at the far side of the shop, one with a fixed bayonet, the other without—thinks more than twenty persons entered—before "the business was done," heard somebody come from setting-up to casting-shop, and asked Asher, "if he was mortally wounded"—he replied—"he did not know, he was very weak"—he then required Asher to give him his hand; but witness, understanding he meant his, extended it for that purpose, and thought the hand a very small one for a man.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Denman.*—Was not so much frightened until he heard the pistol fired; has seen Towle in custody, and at the gaol, several times; knew him again "directly he clapped his eyes upon him." Only saw Slater once in gaol, and never saw Towle from that night till he saw him in custody; witness picked Slater out of the three, on the Wednesday week after. Witness gave his evidence before he heard of the reward; saw a PART of the hand-bill the day after posted in Loughborough, "but not the FULL of it;" knew there was a reward of five hundred pounds, but thought it applied only to those concerned in the outrage. Witness described Towle before the magistrates. Does not know George Woollerton, but saw Mr. Ayres, his employer, on Saturday morning. Did not think it prudent to tell every body all he knew of the affair; never gave him any reason to suppose that they were disguised. Witness knows John King, and admits that he told him, and several others, that he could not recognise the prisoners; he was advised so to do by the magistrates, to avoid unnecessary questions daily put to him; witness did say that he thought he could swear to two voices; never said to Samuel Kilbourn that they were in disguise, and it was *impossible* to recognise them; he told William Burson, on Sunday morning, that he knew none of them.

*Re-examined by Serjeant Vaughan.*—Witness felt himself much injured, and would give himself no trouble to satisfy any body on the subject. Has no doubt of Towle being one of the men that entered the premises; he knew him when he first saw him in custody; and is equally confident as to Slater being another, he recognised him also when he first saw him after the outrage, which was at Leicester.

JOSEPH SHERWIN worked with Messrs. Heathcoat and Boden on the 28th June last, as a framesmith—he was in the top room, on the night in question, and was alarmed by pieces firing off—and soon after hearing somebody exclaim, "blow their brains out"—heard a "*large* muttering of talking outside the factory," and a noise in the room below, proceeding from breaking the frames—thinks he was got out of his frames at that time—looked for the fire arms, but did not find them—went down stairs and found a pike, but it was too long to use on the staircase—then procured a large file, and taking a candle out of the stick, went to the top of the stairs where somebody was chopping at the door check, and soon after observed the door open, and again put to—he then went down stairs, and forced it open with the file, but had scarcely done so, than a man presented a firelock at his breast, saying—"D\*\*n your blood, stand fast, or I'll blow your brains out," on which witness said—"Stop my friend, I can use a musket as well as you can,—when the man cried out, "Ned, come forward with those four blunderbusses, and directly came forth a man armed with two pistols, followed by another with an axe upon his shoulder, who turned his face back, and desired witness to go up stairs to the top shop, which he did, accompanied by three men, who commanded him and the other men at work, "to lay down on their faces, or they would blow their brains out," which summons the witness and his companions instantly obeyed—there was four lights with reflectors, burning at the time, which enabled witness to observe the faces of two men minutely; saw Towle first, he had an handkerchief on his face, which fell below his chin while witness was stooping; is "quite certain sure" the prisoner at the bar is the man, as he was only three or four yards from him; Towle had a musket in his hand. Saw Slater first in custody at the Anchor, in Loughborough; thinks he was one of the men, as there was a large limbed man, but cannot swear to his face. Supposes there were sixteen or seventeen men in the room at the time of breaking the machines. Heard some of them say, as he lay on the floor, "Blow their brains out, if they stir," and others said, "No! Do not hurt them," if they lay ten minutes and do not move. Having broke the machines, they set fire to the lace, when one said, "Ned, have you done your duty well?" "Yes," replied another, "we have;" then went towards the stair-case, but observing two other machines in another part, they said, "There are two more," and so broke them, and went away. About two hours after, witness was dispatched to Nottingham, in a post-chaise, and arrived there before six o'clock, and saw the police-officers, to whom he gave a description of all the three men he saw on the stairs.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Balguy.*—Four of the men were upstairs with him; Powell, Streets, Squires, and Smith—Trueman, Webster, and Asher were below,—the gun was not quite up to Towle's shoulder—he had not a candle in one hand, and a musket in the other—he was about a quarter of a minute on the stair-case, but cannot swear how long—it might be longer than a minute—he saw *part* of that man's face who had the axe, but not enough to know him again—when witness went from the top shop, he believes there were no lights but those in the frames,—the *shiner* or reflector is used to throw light on the works, but it does not make the room lighter—he could not take particular notice of the third man's face, but could swear to him if he were in the same dress. He cannot tell when he first heard of the reward—he never thought of it, when he was examined before the magistrates—he does not expect any of it to his knowledge—never thought of the reward till people told him he should have a part of it—he believes he shall have a part of it—does not know William Henshaw to his knowledge—Robinson married witness's sister; he went to Robinson's house soon after the frames were broken—his sister and Robinson were up—every body was talking about the frame-breaking—did not say that he did not know any body that came into the factory—does not remember saying any thing about the disguises—he never said any thing about the men having their coats turned—cannot say any thing at all about what he said about them having their faces blackened—cannot tell whether he said so or not. John Rose was in his company the same day at the Talbot, but witness never told him, that neither he nor any body else, could swear to any of them—acknowledged that he said to Bilson that he did not know any of them, but at that time his life was threatened—admits that he has said, "that he could not swear to any, but should like to swear to two, because they would have taken our lives, if it had not been for the other Ludds"—has been at Leicester several times—saw Badder in gaol; has also seen Towle in the gaol-yard several times; he attended on the examination of prisoners—Mr. Mundy and Mr. Lockett told witness not to say any thing about what he knew.

ANN MACKIE is wife to ——————— Mackie, who works for Heathcoat and Boden—she was held a prisoner by the Luddites a short distance from the factory, upwards of forty minutes; during which a man came up with an axe, and lifting it up over her head, said, "It will not do for us to let her escape, we had better do for her,"—the man that guarded her replied, "No, if she will stand still her life shall be spared"—the man with the axe was a broad-set man—there was not light enough to see his face—he only remained a little time.

JAMES LAWSON, is a police-officer of Nottingham; has known Towle some time; recollects seeing him at a public-house in Nottingham on the Tuesday preceding the outrage at Loughborough, and had a deal of conversation with about his having been tried for frame-breaking, which Towle observed would have been a job with him, if they had found him guilty. Witness advised him to leave off that kind of life. A confusion arising in the house, witness and Towle went out together into the street, where they resumed their conversation. Towle said he was out of employment, and when he went round and was asked his name, they immediately said, "Oh! it is you that was tried for frame-breaking!" He said, "He was over-persuaded, and felt so much hurt, he hardly knew what to do with himself," many of their SET were doing well, while he was used ill, and he had a good mind to SPLIT upon them. Witness's wife coming up at this time, he said, "He would be d————d if he would trust a woman with a secret," and so stopped speaking for a moment, and then resumed by saying, "There was something brewing, and there would be a job before it was long—it would happen next Friday night, unless put off, and then it would take place on Saturday night!"—"we then parted, and I bid him good night." Having communicated this intelligence to the Mayor, numbers were employed on the look-out in Nottingham; witness was one engaged on the occasion.

*Cross-examined*—Towle well knew that he was a Police officer.

BENJAMIN BARNES is a Nottingham Police officer—saw Sherwin on the morning of the 29th June last—in consequence of his description of one of the men seen by him at the factory, he looked after James Towle that morning—about seven o'clock he set out towards Beeston through New Basford, where Towle lived, and having arrived about the middle of the former place, he observed prisoner coming from towards Loughborough—it was about eight o'clock in the morning—Towle seeing witness approach him, made a stop, and turned his face to the hedge, on noticing which witness rode on a little, and then turned again, and on overtaking him, he endeavoured to avoid letting witness recognize his face, by appearing to look at something over the hedge—witness however spoke to him, saying, "James, how are you, you seem very fatigued this morning?"—"Yes," he answered, "I am very unwell." Witness asked him if he would take a glass, to which he assented, and they went to a public house door, where Towle had a glass of gin, and they parted—his shoes seemed wet, and the dust had settled upon them. On Monday, July 1st, I had a warrant to apprehend him—"went to his house at New Basford and took him, handcuffed him to myself—on arriving at Nottingham, we went to a public house to until a chaise could be got ready—when there he wished to go in the yard, which I permitted him to do, handcuffed to White, a constable, from whom he contrived to escape, by slipping his hand out of the handcuffs, (which were the smallest sort to be met with,) but was re-taken soon after in the Market-place. When employed to take Towle to Leicester, he said to witness, in coming down Red-hill, (the place where criminals were formerly executed,) "Well, I shall have a ride as far back again as this hill, I suppose." On witness asking him "what he meant by that," he said," he was sure to be hung, and hoped witness would call upon his mother, and say, that he desired, in case he should be hung, that she should would beg his body, and let it be placed alongside Bamford, at Basford." Witness said, he would not *deliver* such a message; but he would take a note for him—Towle then observed, "it was through seeing him (Barnes) at Beeston, that he was apprehended. The axe was found at Badder's, and a hammer at Slater's, in the coal cupboard.

MR. DENMAN here observed, that the Counsel ought to make their election on which set of counts they mean to stand, Towle being charged both as a principal and accessary.

MR. BARON GRAHAM said, it was not a case of that description.

MR. DENMAN then took an objection to the wording of the indictment, owing to the word "feloniously" having been omitted before the words "entered the premises," &c. and contended, that such an omission must prove fatal to the indictment, since it was not according to the act of parliament, under which the prisoners were indicted.

SERJEANT VAUGHAN, on the other side, maintained, that as the words, "felony aforesaid" came shortly after, the omission complained of, was of little consequence, and therefore opposed the acquittal of the prisoners on that ground.

The Learned Judge observed, that it appeared to him at present, that there was no ground upon which the indictment could be done away; but if hereafter, it should appear otherwise, the prisoners should certainly have all the advantage of the omission; but he must say, he felt pretty confident at the present moment, that the objection could not be sustained.

The Learned Judge here called upon Towle and Slater for their defence; both observed, they left it to their Counsel. Badder was not called upon for his defence, upon which his Counsel requested he might have his irons taken off, but it was not allowed; he was permitted, however, to sit down.

JAMES POWELL, was employed as watchman to Heathcoat and Boden, on the night of the 28th of June last. [It being observed that this witness was in a state of intoxication, his evidence was not permitted to be taken, he was therefore ordered from the bar.]

SAMUEL STREET worked at Heathcoat and Boden's factory on the night of the 28th June last—thinks thirty or forty men entered the upper shop—he counted them by their steps, as he lay down—could only see one distinctly.

SAMUEL KILBOURN asked John Webster if he knew the frame-breakers±he said he did not, they were so much disguised—he even did not know one of them.

JOHN ROSE knows Joseph Sherwin—he told him at two o'clock on the Saturday morning, he could not swear to any of the frame-breakers.

WILLIAM BILSON has conversed with Sherwin—he told it was impossible to know them—their coats were turned.

JOHN RICHARDS lives at New Basford, within seventy or eighty yards of Towle's—saw him at nine o'clock on Friday night, the 28th of June—he had a paper cap on, and was getting potatoes in his garden—witness spoke to him, and observed "what fine potatoes they are"—Towle answered, "Yes they are."

JOSEPH MELLOR, is a carpenter and builder, lives at New Basford; had been at a *rearing* supper at the Robin Hood and Little John, in Nottingham, on the 28th June last; `[TH: dinner to celebrate completion of outer walls of a building.]` left it after 11 o'clock—knows James Towle; saw him between eleven and twelve o'clock the night in question; there was a light in his house, saw prisoner come to his door, and throw something out—said, "Hallo, Towle!" and he replied, "Hallo, Joseph, where have you been?" to a *rearing*, said witness, and then passed on—got home about twelve—heard of frame breaking at twelve next day—has no doubt of Towle's person.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Clarke*—Lives half a mile from prisoner's house—witness has known him since he was a child—is now twenty-one.

JOHN BRADLEY lives at Basford; remembers being at Towle's house at half-past eleven o'clock on the Friday night; went to borrow a candle for his wife to seam stockings by, in order that he might set out early in the morning to Nottingham, in search of work—resides only a few yards from Towle's—saw him soon after eleven in his (Towle's) own house—witness went to bed at half-past eleven, or thereabouts; got up next morning about ten minutes past four, to go to Nottingham—saw Towle at work in his frame at half-past four—Basford is seventeen miles from Loughborough.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Clarke.*—Witness applied to Mr. Beardmore for work—saw him at half-past six—Towle was nursing his child at half-past eleven the night before—thinks he was stript.

PETER JENKINSON lives at Old Basford; is a paper-maker—he got up between three and four o'clock on Saturday morning the 29th June, to call up his fellow-workmen, that they might leave off an hour or two earlier in the afternoon—saw Towle at work in his frame between four and five o'clock as he passed by to call up Harrison—on his return, stopped and spoke to Towle for a minute.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Clarke.*—Witness lives half a mile from Harrison's—it struck four when he got up to give him the key.

*Re-examined by Mr. Denman*—It is a rule among his shop-mates the first up calls the rest.

THOMAS MELLOR is a butcher; got up at four o'clock on Saturday morning the 29th of June to go to his shop, which is behind Towle's house; saw prisoner and his wife at work in the frame at half-past four o'clock.

GEORGE ARCHER knows Slater; he worked with him in June last; left him at work at eight o'clock on Friday night, at witness's house; returned at nine, but he was gone; saw him the following morning at seven; he assisted him to get up work; always considered Slater as an honest and industrious man.

THOMAS PALMER lives in Nottingham; has a garden a short distance from the town; was returning from it on Friday night, the 28th of June, about half-past nine; observed Slater in his garden, which is near witness's, and held half an hour's conversation with him, then went into town together, where they parted, one going to the right, the other to the left.

JOSEPH SMITH is a brass-cock maker, and lives in Narrow-marsh, Nottingham; remembers being at the Leg of Mutton public-house on Friday night, 28th of June last; on hearing the clock strike eleven, he were left the house, and as he was coming home he met with Slater, whom he has known more than two years, and spoke to him; he was a few paces from his own door, without his hat, and said, "How did you do, John?" he replied, "Very well." Witness thinks he was going towards the privy.

SAMUEL HAYNES lives at Nottingham; recollects leaving the Duke of Wellington public-house in company with S. Fletcher, about eleven o'clock on the Friday night; saw Slater standing beside his door, when passing his house with Fletcher.

SAM. FLETCHER, is a framework-knitter; was with the last witness at the Duke of Wellington public-house on the night of the 28th June last, and came away about eleven o'clock; parted with Haynes at his entry end; saw Slater at his own door, and had a few minutes conversation about the state of trade; met a person named Rhodes, and stood talking with him a few moments. Witness made no secret of having seen Slater.

DENNIS RHODES remembers seeing Slater on the Friday night, conversing with Samuel Haynes, and a another man, a stranger; they were standing at Slater's door. Witness asked Haynes the news of the day; did not stop long, but went on.

THOMAS BEE, lives next door but one to Slater; has known him six years; he is a very honest and industrious man.

WILLIAM SHARP is a miller and baker in Nottingham; has known Slater nine years, "never knew his character to be impeached with dishonesty."

AARON BOWLER has known Slater a long time; believes him to be an honest and industrious man.

JOHN SMITH lives at New Basford; has known Towle fifteen years; never heard any particular harm of him; considers him to be a man of "tolerable character."

GEORGE BINGHAM lives in Millstone-lane, Nottingham; has known Slater seven years, sometimes worked with him; never knew of this character being any but a good one.

THOMAS SANDERS "is an independent gentleman," and lives at New Basford; has known Towle several years; he has been a quiet good character and neighbour.

MR LOCKET here produced the deposition made by Towle before the magistrates; from which it appeared, that the prisoner dined and supped at home on the Friday; that at half-past nine he was in his garden, getting a few potatoes for supper, and that in the morning he got up early and went to Long Eaton, from whence he returned the same morning.

The Learned Judge then recapitulated the evidence, impressing upon the Jury the importance of the matter submitted to their consideration, and calling upon them to weigh the different circumstances which had been detailed before them, with all that deliberate attention, which the subject required.

The Jury, after a few minutes consultation, gave their verdict—Towle, Guilty of aiding and abetting, but not of firing the pistol.—Slater and Badder, Not Guilty.

*Counsel for the Prosecution*—Serjeant Vaughan, Serjeant Copley, Mr. Clarke, Mr. Reader, and Mr. Reynolds.—*Solicitor*, Mr. Lockhart, of Derby.

*Counsel for the Prisoner*—Mr. Denman and Mr. Balguy.—*Solicitor*, Mr Wilkinson, of Nottingham.

When the court broke up, it was between nine and ten o'clock, the trial having lasted upwards of fourteen hours.

We cannot withhold that need of praise which is so justly due to C.W. Pochin, Esq. the High Sheriff, for his admirable precautions to prevent any kind of riot or disturbance, which at one time was seriously apprehended. Not being possessed with that military mania which is too prevalent in the present day, he proceeded in a truly constitutional manner, to collect together the civil power of the county, and as we are informed, upwards of 600 constables were in attendance; these proved themselves abundantly sufficient to preserve peace and tranquillity, in the midst of a greater multitude of people, than was ever before assembled together on one such occasion in Leicester. We should like such an example to be more generally followed, for in that case, we should not behold the military called in on every trifling occasion.

## The Execution of James Towle

On the passing of a capital sentence, the execution itself would typically follow quite quickly. But following the trial, Towles' counsel, Mr. Denman, made an appeal based the wording of the original indictment. This led to a respite in carrying out the sentence of the court; but when the twelve judges ruled against the appeal, Towle's fate was sealed.

As was typical of reports of the more notable executions of the time, a brief biography of the executed man was described. In the following example, the cruelty Towle had inflicted on his mother by forcing her to suffer the shame he had inflicted on her was presented as a lesson to others. His previous encounter with the law, in which he was found not guilty of the attack on Mr Garton's house, was mentioned, along with the appeal against the sentence made by Mr Denman.

Following the execution, Towle's body was then claimed by his cousin and transported back to Basford for burial under various conditions intended to prevent any public assembly around it .

Nottingham Review - Friday 22 November 1816

Execution of James Towle.

This unfortunate man, who, on Wednesday last, in the vigour of manhood, and prime of his days, paid the forfeit of his life to the offended laws of this country, was born at Old Basford, in this county, of honest and creditable parents; one of whom, the father, was, about two years ago, seized by the icy hand of death, and has therefore, happily been prevented from feeling the painful emotions which must agitate the parental breast, and tear every feeling of a father's heart, in the contemplation of the disgraceful end of a darling son; but the widowed bereaved mother, is left to struggle with all the anguish which such a catastrophe is capable of inspiring. HER feelings we will not attempt to describe; the death of a son, is painful under any circumstances; but in the present instance, after all the hopes that might have been excited by the long delay which has taken place since the awful sentence of the law was passed, the thorns, which tear her heart, must be beyond description terrible: the barbed arrow of sorrow has entered, which probably will never be extracted while life remains.

Towle was apprenticed to his father, as a framework-knitter; and no particular circumstance marked his character until he arrived at manhood; but since that period, HIS LIFE has several times been in jeopardy, in consequence of his bad conduct, and immoral life. In the year 1814, he was accused of being one of the band of framebreakers that destroyed some frames in Mr Garton's house, in New Basford, the village in which Towle then lived, and at the Lent Assizes following, he was put the bar, in the County-hall, in this town, and tried for the offence; but after a long consultation, the Jury brought in a verdict of NOT GUILTY. In July, 1816, he was, however, again committed to prison on the charge for which he has now paid the penalty of the law. The offence having been perpetrated at Loughborough, he was of course confined in Leicester gaol, and on Saturday morning, August 10, about seven o'clock, he, along with John Slater Benjamin Badder, was put to the bar. The trial lasted upwards of twelve hours, and after Baron Graham, who presided, had given his charge, the Jury found Towle GUILTY OF AIDING AND ABETTING, BUT NOT OF FIRING THE PISTOL AT ASHER; and in consequence of the verdict, Baron Graham passed sentence of death upon him.

In the course of the trial, Mr. Denman, one of the counsel for the prisoners, made some objections to the wording of the indictment; and the prisoner was respited, in order that the opinion of the twelve Judges might be taken on the subject. On the 13th of November, the case was argued in the Court of Exchequer, and the following reports of it is given in the London papers:—

"The twelve Judges sat in the Exchequer Chamber to hear arguments on the reserved case of James Towle, one of the men convicted before Mr. Baron Graham, at Leicester. The Prisoner was one of those persons connected with the frame-breakers, and was charged with several others, with shooting at certain of his Majesty's subjects with intent to kill them. The two points reserved were, first, that the Jury having found the Prisoner guilty of being present, but not of firing the pistol he could not be found guilty as a principle; and further, that on account of the word 'feloniously' being omitted in the accounts, charging him with being an aider and abettor, neither could be found guilty upon those counts.

"Mr Denman was heard at considerable length in support of the objections taken at the trial, and submitted, that the Prosecutors Counsel, by having put the question to the Jury, whether the prisoner was the person who fired the gun or not, and having drawn from them an opinion, must not now complain, if that opinion should prove fatal to the prosecution.

"Mr Reynolds, on the other side, argued in support the verdict Guilty; and contended, that the word 'feloniously' being mentioned in the first count, must be taken to be so connected with the words 'then and there present aiding and assisting' in the other counts, so as to over-rule them all. The Learned Counsel also contended, that this case came precisely under the provisions of the Black Act, and therefore, that all those aiding and abetting must be considered as principals. With respect to the question put to the Jury, and their finding upon it, the question itself was unnecessary, and the answer to it ought, in no way, to affect the verdict in any legal point of view."

The Judges being unanimous in their opinion, that the objections could not be sustained, the law was ordered to take its course. The unhappy man heard the result of the application with the utmost fortitude and composure; and constantly, whenever opportunity served, declared his innocence.—He several times expressed his thankfulness to Mr. Musson, the keeper, for the kind treatment he had received from him, which was all along distinguished by Mr. M's characteristic humanity.

On Tuesday, the Rev. Mr. Highton, the chaplain to the County Gaol, preached what is termed the condemned sermon; and on the same morning, Towle took a very affecting farewell of his wife and four young children.

On Wednesday morning, he was taken, under an escort, in a chaise, to the building, an appendage to the New Bridewell now erecting, within a few yards of the west-end of the infirmary. At an early hour, great numbers assembled to see the new drop (which had been placed there only the day before) and kept increasing until twelve o'clock, when Towle, with a firm and undaunted step, came upon the platform, attended by the Sheriff and his deputy, the chaplain, the two gaolers, &c. after paying the utmost possible attention to the prayers of the chaplain, with a firm and audible voice, he gave out one of Dr. Watt's admirable hymns, beginning with—

"Oh! for an overcoming faith,  
To cheer my dying hours;  
To triumph o'er the monster death,  
With all his frightful powers."

He gave out the whole of the hymn, two lines at a time, and joined in singing it with the utmost fervency. About half past twelve, every thing being ready the platform fell, and launched him into eternity, in the presence of an immense number of spectators, who conducted themselves in the most orderly manner, and without the least attempt at disturbance.

After hanging the usual time, his body was demanded by his cousin Josiah Towle, who before he could obtain it, was required to put his hand to the following document:—

*"The corpse of James Towle having been delivered to me on behalf of his mother, who is desirous of interring it at Basford, I hereby undertake that the same shall be buried there before sunset to-morrow, with all possible privacy, and I hereby make myself responsible that there shall be no public exhibition, either previously to, or at the funeral, and particularly that the corpse shall not be detained in the town of Nottingham, but that the same shall be conveyed, as privately as possible, through that town, and in case of any disturbance taking place, in consequence of the conveyance or burial of the said corpse, I consent this paper may be produced in evidence against me.*

*"Dated this 20th of Nov. 1816.*

*"JOSIAH + TOWLE" / HIS MARK*

*"I further engage that the corpse shall not be halted or detained at any other place between Leicester and Basford, than the following:—*

*"To bail for one hour at Rothley House.*  
*"To put up for the night or bail at Costock.  
*"To bail for one hour at Bradmore and from thence to Basford without stopping."*

The body was conveyed through Nottingham during the course of Wednesday night, and on Thursday afternoon, was committed to the earth in Basford church yard, by the side of his father, in the presence of thousands of spectators; every thing being conducted in the most peaceable and orderly manner.

In the *Leeds Mercury* report of the execution, along with biography, the description of the execution, and the conditions under which the body would be transported back for burial, we also find a letter from Towle to his wife after their final meeting written on the night before his execution.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 30 November 1816

EXECUTION OF J. TOWLE THE LUDDITE

Towle was apprentice to his father, a frame-work-knitter; and no particular circumstance marked his character, good or bad, until he arrived at manhood; but since that period, his life has several times been in jeopardy. In the year 1814 he was accused of being one of the band of frame-breakers that destroyed some frames in Mr. Garton's house, in New Basford, the village in which Towle then lived; and at the Lent Assizes following, he was put to the bar, in the County-Hall, in Nottingham, and tried for the offence; but after a long consultation, the Jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. In July, 1816, he was, however, again committed to prison on the charge for which he has now paid the penalty of the law. The offence having been perpetrated at Loughborough, he was of course confined in Leicester gaol, and on Saturday morning, August 10, about seven o'clock, he, along with John Slater and Benjamin Badder, was put to the bar. The trial lasted upwards of twelve hours, and after Baron Graham, who presided, had given his charge, the Jury found Towle *Guilty of aiding and abetting, but not of firing the pistol at Asher*. And, in consequence of the verdict, Baron Graham passed sentence of death upon him.

In the course of the trial, Mr. Denman, one of the counsel for the prisoners, made some objections to the wording of the indictment; and the prisoner was respited, in order that the opinion of the twelve Judges might be taken on the subject.

On the 13th November the case was argued. The Judges being unanimous in their opinion, that the objections could not be sustained, the law was ordered to take its course.
  
On the morning of Wednesday se'nnight, he was taken, under an escort, in a chaise, to the building, an appendage to the New Bridewell now erecting, a short distance from the west end of the Infirmary. At an early hour, great numbers assembled to see the new drop (which had been placed there only the day before) and kept increasing until twelve o'clock, when Towle, with a firm and undaunted step, came upon the platform, attended by the Sheriff and his deputy, the chaplain, the two gaolers, &c. after paying the utmost possible attention to the prayers of the chaplain, with a firm and audible voice, he gave out one of Dr. Watts's admirable hymns, beginning with

> "Oh! for an overcoming faith,  
> To cheer my dying hours;
> To triumph o'er the monster death,  
> With all his frightful powers."

He gave out the whole of this hymn, two lines at a time, and joined in singing it with the utmost fervency. About half past twelve, every thing being ready, the platform fell, and launched him into eternity, in the presence of an immense number of spectators, who conducted themselves in the most orderly manner, and without the least attempt at disturbance.

After hanging the usual time, his body was demanded by his cousin Josiah Towle, who, before he could obtain it, was required to put his hand to the following document:—

"The corpse of James Towle having been delivered to me on behalf of his mother, who is desirous of interring it at Basford, I hereby undertake that the same shall be buried there before sunset tomorrow, with all possible privacy, and I hereby make myself responsible that there shall be no public exhibition, either previously to, or at the funeral, and particularly that the corpse shall not be detained at the town of Nottingham, but that the same shall be conveyed, as privately as possible, through that town, and in case of any disturbance taking place, in consequence of the conveyance or burial of the said corpse, I consent that this paper may be produced in evidence against me." JOSIAH TOWLE X his Mark.

"Dated this 20th of Nov. 1816."

"I further engage that the corpse shall not be halted or detained at any other place, between Leicester and Basford, than the following:-

"To bait one hour at Rothley-House'.

"To put up for the night or bait at Costock.
  
"To bait for one hour at Bradmore, and from thence to Basford without stopping."
  
The body was conveyed through Nottingham during the course of Wednesday night, and on Thursday afternoon, was committed to the earth in Basford church-yard, by the side of his father, in the presence of thousands of spectators ;-every thing being conducted in the most peaceable and orderly manner.

James Towle was about five feet two inches high, 34 years of age, and has left a wife and four children to lament his untimely end. During the whole of his confinement, he conducted himself with great propriety, but elicited nothing that would at all implicate the *Luddites*, in whose dark and diabolical system he has been the first to suffer. His wife and four children, with some relatives, arrived on Sunday, and continued until Tuesday. The following letter, addressed to his wife, written after her departure, and late on the night previous to his execution, will best exemplify the tranquil state his mind was brought to from an attention to religious exercises since his condemnation:—

"Dear Wife— In a few more hours I shall be no more. But my dear creature, in my last moments it is my duty to beg of you to seek for that peace in God which is far beyond my pen to describe or tongue to speak; and my dear girl, above all, I hope you will bring my dear children up in the fear and love of God, and then you will find a friend-a friend that will support you through all the troubles of this world, and in the hour of death give you that comfort that will raise your mind far above all the treasures that the earth can afford. My dear girl, this afternoon there has been a gentleman that wished to see me, and promised me that he would do a something for you towards making you comfortable, and my dear, I have no doubt but my mother will be agreeable for you and my dear children to be with her, and I hope and trust she will be a mother and is guardian to my sweet babes, which in so short a time will be fatherless. Dear wife, my last words are, may God Almighty bless and protect you and my dear children in this world, and prepare you for the world to come, is my sincere prayer.

"From your dying husband

"James Towle.

"Tuesday night, ten o'clock"

## A Final Confession

Towle's story, however, doesn't quite end there. For it seems that James Towle had nit just written to his wife but he had also turned King's evidence on the morning prior to hios execution, and implicated several others in the attack on Heathcoat's factory in Loughborough, as was revealed to the public in the *Nottingham Review* of Friday 24 January, 1817.

Nottingham Review - Friday 24 January 1817

We find that James Towle, on the morning previous to his execution, made a full and particular disclosure, to the High Sheriff of Leicestershire, and to a Justice of the Peace, for that county, of every person, directly or indirectly concerned in the felony and destruction, at Mr. Heathcoat's factory, at Loughborough, and of the Luddites in general, which has been kept secret, until it could be made subservient to the ends of justice ;—he died penitent; assured the gentlemen that what he had stated to them was true, observing, it would be of no service to him then to say what was false, and lamented that he had not made this discovery sooner, to have saved his life:—his comrades are now doing so; the Luddites are impeaching one another, and the Magistrates are in possession, we are credibly informed, of their whole history. Of the 15 men now apprehended, ten are charged with the offence at Loughborough. It is hoped that the wicked and mischievous proceedings of the Luddites are now at an end: they have driven the best part of our manufactory from the town, and the destruction of property employed in trade, has injured the great bulk of manufacturers and the public in general. We hope and trust that the time will be revived, when the ingenuity and industry of our mechanics will again raise the trade of this empire above the rest of the world; and we feel confident, that the skill of the workman, will be powerfully aided by the great capital this country can bring into trade, whenever it can be done with security, and the master and servant are free to make what contracts they may choose to enter into with each other. As none of the men have yet been examined before the magistrates, we decline entering into further particulars until next week.

...

On the 15th instant, Joseph Mellors, Nathan Diggle, and Daniel Diggle were committed to the county gaol, for trial at the next assizes, charged with shooting at William Cooke and Francis Thorley, at Trowell, in this County.

The three men, for whose apprehension a reward was offered; they being charged with assaulting the Earl of Chesterfield's gamekeepers, have been taken up, and were lodged in our county gaol on Wednesday night; but they have not yet been examined before the magistrates.
