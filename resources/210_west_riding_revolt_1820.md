PROVINCIAL JOURNALS.

The following is an extract from the *Leeds Intelligencer* of yesterday, a paper always marked by good information and sound principles. The *Mercury*, to which it refers, is a Journal of so different a description, that it is well for the town that the former paper exists to counteract the *radical* tendency of the latter. But if the *Mercury* gives such an account of the *intention* of the *Radicals*, there can be little reason to doubt its correctness, and it is therefore rather surprising that a Radical Journal should so openly have developed that intention.

"We last week communicated to our readers, the alarming intelligence relative to the designs of the disaffected in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. Several of the London Editors have insinuated, that, although there might be some ground for the suspicions of the Magistrates, yet, that the greatest part of our narrative must be fictious. We, however, can inform these gentlemen, who would scout all idea of danger till it has entered our very houses, that instead of exaggerating, we *under-rated*, the extent of the contemplated insurrection, and the consequent alarm; and that every subsequent account has more than confirmed our previous statements. We would refer those who are inclined to suspect the truth of our narrative, and to question the existence of a disposition to rebellion and outrage, to the *Mercury* of Saturday last. They will there find a detailed plan of operations, by which the town of Huddersfield was to be approached on the North, West, East, and South sides; and (says the Editor),—

"Having thus strrounded the town, all the parties were to advance at the same moment, and while one division captured the horse barracks, and secured the cavalry, another was to take possession of the barracks occupied by the infantry, who were also to be secured: the Civil Authorities were at the same moment to be made prisoners, and the principal inhabitants of the town confined to their dwellings by the new Provisional Government. This desperate project, wicked and visionary as it may appear, was undoubtedly formed, and the capture of Huddersfield, with the stoppage of the coaches, usually passing through that place, were to form the signals for the general rising!"

"We think the above must convince the most sceptical, as to the actual existence of a conspiracy of a very atrocious nature; a conspiracy which, but for the vigilance of the Magistrates, would have involved in ruin and misery a populous town, and perhaps occasioned the loss of thousands of lives! Nor was it in Huddersfield alone that the enemies of social order, and of the Constitution, were at work. Our accounts from Scotland state, that a simultaneous rising was expected in the vicinity of Glasgow, in which town (and also in Paisley and the neighbouring villages) the workmen left their employ, at the command of an anonymous incendiary, declaring they would not return till their grievances were redressed.— These towns were kept in a state of alarm for three or four days; and we have details to lay before our Readers, which will prove that those alarms were not groundless."
