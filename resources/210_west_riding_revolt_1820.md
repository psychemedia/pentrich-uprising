DISTURBANCES AT HUDDERSFIELD.

For several days, the peaceable inhabitants of this town have been kept in a state of great agitation and terror, from the alarming indications in the neighbourhood. We present the following statements to our readers exactly as they have been given to us, only premising, that we collected them on the spot, from the individuals to whom they refer; and that depositions to the same effect have, we beleve, been made before the Magistrates.

The civil authorities have suspected, for some time, that arms were clandestinely introduced into the neighbourhood; but, notwithstanding their vigilance, they were unable to ascertain the fact in a satisfactory manner. On Thursday last, a parcel from Birmingham arrived by the Regulator, addressed to "John Payne, Castlegate, Huddersfield," which excited the suspicions or Mr. Whitehead, the deputy constable, who thought it proper to wait the arrival of the person who should call for it. Towards evening, a notorious radical of the name of Gill, inquired for the package. Whitehead, who was in attendance, came forwards, and desired to know its contents. The answers of Gill were very evasive and unsatisfactory;— it was opened in his presence, and found to contain a sword, two brace of pistols, three bayonets, three bullet moulds, and two gun locks. An invoice was inclosed, from which it appeared, the charge for the sword was five shillings; for the pistols per brace, sixteen shillings; the bayonet and gun locks fouurteen pence each; and the bullet moulds fourpence. A letter was also found, soliciting further commands; and stating, that the hurry with which the articles were required prevented them from being exactly according to order; that those sent, were of a superior quality; but, in the present instance, were invoiced at a reduced price. Gill was immediately apprehended: and the following day he was examined before the Magistrates, J. Haigh, and B. H. Allen, Esqrs. The account he gave of the parcel was, that Payne, who is a higler, and at present from home, requested him to take charge of it till his return. He was held to bail, to answer any charge which may be brought against him, at the next assizes.

This occurrence naturally excited the apprehensions of the Magistrates: and early on Friday, they received information, that great numbers of the lower class in the neighbourhood, were armed with pikes and pistols, and that in the course of that night, an attack was meditated upon the town, an a given signal, by numerous pikemen, in bodies of two hundred each. With the promptitude and alacrity which they hare manifested on many former occasions, every arrangement was made for the security of the town. A detachment of the 85th foot, under Captain Welling, and the 4th Dragoons, under Captain Sibthorpe, were held in readiness to act at a moment's notice ; and late in the evening, the yeomanry were called out, and other precautionary measures adopted. The signal, a sort of tire balloon, was observed about two o'clock on Saturday morning; in the direction of Castle Hill, near Almondbury; and several parties of men, in regular order, were seen, in different directions, approaching the town. One division came so near as the Marsh turnpike, a short distance from the New Church. None of them, however, entered the town, having, it is supposed, received intelligence of the preparations made by the Magistrates. Two large bodies assembled on Barkisland Common, and proceeded on their way, as far as Lindley Moor; but not being joined, as they expected, by some other parties, they returned home, and dispersed quietly, except firing guns and pistols on their route.

A circumstance occurred the same evening, which convinced the magistrates that their apprehensions were not groundless. About eleven o'clock, a gentleman who lives near Cooper-bridge, was returning to that place from Middleton, accompanied by a game-keeper, and three other persons, whom they had accidentally overtaken. On arriving at the Obelisk, (or Dumb-Steeple, as it is usually called) near Kirklees, which, our readers will recollect, is the place where the Luddites rendezvoused, previously to their attacking Mr. Cartwright's mill, they passed about fifteen men, in a square or circle, apparently in close consultation. Two of the party, named Brearley and Smith, turned off into the New Road; and the rest proceeded towards Cooper-bridge. They had not,however, gone 100 yards, before they heard their late companions calling for help.— On returning back, and entering the road, they were surprised to see a number of men, sat under a hedge or wall, each armed with a pike or spear, and near them was a quantity of the same weapons, about 200, heaped on the ground. The gentleman, who was separated from his companions, took up one of the pikes, and was proceeding to examine it, when one of the men struck him, and he was attacked by several others. His waistcoat was cut by the pikes, but his person was unhurt. At the same moment a number ot persons, at least sixty, came over an adjoining wall armed in the same manner. He saw them exercise, and they appeared to be very expert. The gentleman felt alarmed at his dangerous situation, and attempted to make off; — while doing so, a pistol or musket was discharged after him, the ball of which whizzed close past his head. He heard several other guns fired, as he returned home.— In the mean time, the rest of the party were attacked and beaten. One of them, named Tolson, received several pike wounds, particularly one on the left side, and is now under the care of a surgeon. Smith was cut in the hand, Early the next morning, information was given to the magistrates, and one of the men whom they were able to identify, a blacksmith, was apprehended, and is now in custody.

During the whole of Saturday, the military and civil power were on the alert. A number of additional special constables were sworn in; and several seizures of pikes and other arms, were made in the neighbouring villages, particularly at Almondbury. In a house at the latter place, a quantity of pike staves, great numbers of which have been cut from the neighbouring plantations, were found concealed. Some of the pikes, or rather, spears, we have seen. They are of very coarse workmanship, the blade about nine inches long, sharp pointed, and having at the broad end a screw, with which they are fastened into a pole, about 7 feet long.

Parties, of horse and foot patrolled the town and neighbourhood during the whole of Saturday night, and two men were apprehended at an early hour on Sunday morning. A large party was seen assembled on Saturday night, about four miles from Huddersfield in the neighbourhood of Hartshead, but they dispersed before the military were apprised of their meeting.

The town and neighbourhood were tranquil during the whole of yesterday; but several apprehensions were expected to take place, in the course of last night.

The following persons are in custody, on charges connected with these proceedings:— *Joseph* and *Benjamin Barker*, of Mirfield; *John Lindley*, of Mirfield; *George Barker*, of Colne-Bridge; *Joshua Hirst*, of Deighton.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 08 April 1820

TO DO

HUDDERSFIELD, April 7.

The town of Huddersfield and its neighbourhood have been suddenly thrown into a state of considerable agitation and alarm. The civil authorities, and the military power, have been kept upon the alert day and night ever since Friday last, and the peaceable and well disposed inhabitants are preparing to co-oper- ate with them , either as special constables, or under the establishment of the watch and ward act, for the security of their lives and property, and the maintenance of the public peace. For three weeks past the Magistrates have had information, that a simultaneous rising was intended in the manufacturing districts of the king- dom; and in the course of last week it came to our knowledge, that emissaries were going about the coun try exciting the people to arm, and preparing them for some desperate enterprise. We lost no time in ap prising the readers of this journal of the approaching mischief, and in putting the unwary upon their guard against the instigaters; but this caution, as far as re- spected a very populous part of this district, was too late ; for, on the night preceding our last day of publica- tion, the insurgents had assembled in arms, and were preparing to strike a blow, at the contemplation of which the mind recoils with horror. In a matter of this mag nitude, we could not satisfy ourselves with intelligence derived through the ordinary channels, but we deter- mined to investigate the business in person upon the spot, and the following is the result of our information, collected frorn the most authentic sources:-

 A very unusual sensation was observed in many of the villages in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, towards the evening of Friday, the 31st ult. The women were seen passing about to each other's houses, many of them in tears, and several of the men appeared unsettled, and as if meditating some daring enterprise. The Magistrates of Huddersfield, without knowing the precise time when, or the place where, the blow was to be struck, were informed of these indications by their agents, male and female; and the military, throughout the whole of the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, were, we believe, that night under arms. About ten o'clock at night, the general muster commenced, and the initiated, in a great number of the populous villages, by which the town of Huddersfield is surrounded, began to assemble, many of them armed with pikes, some of them with fire- arms, and others with scythes and pitch-forks, purloined from the neighbouring farm-yards and out-buildings. a In some districts the bugle was heard to sound through the vallies, as the signal for muster, but the more general practice was to go to the houses of those who were known, or supposed to be favourable to the design, and to press into the service the head of the family. In some instances force, and in many others threats were used, to swell the ranks of' the disaffected; and not a few of the persons called upon escaped out of their windows, in the rear of their houses, and relieved themselves from further importunity by finding con- cealment in the adjoining woods. The plan of operations was, it seems, to approach the town in four divisions. The Kirkheaton, Skelmanthorp, Grange-Moor, and Kirkburton sections, which may be called the South division, were to assemble at Almond- bury-Bank, within a mile of the centre of the town. The Mirfieid, Hartshead, High-Town, & Coln-Bridge sections, forming the East division, were to rendezvous in Kirklees-Lane, adjoining to the park of Sir George Armitage, ??? which is three miles from Huddersfield. The Thornhill, Dalton, Kirkheaton, Raistrick, and Brighouse sections, forming the North division, were to assemble in Fixby-Park. nearly two miles from that place; and the West division, which was the most numerous, and consisted of the Lindley, Quarmby, Out-Lane, Ripponden, and Barkisland sections, were to assemble on Lindley-Moor, about the same distance from Huddersfield, and all of them having in view the Castle-Hill, on which a beacon was to be lighted as the signal for the commencement of the march upon the town. Having thus surrounded the town, all the parties were to advance at the same moment, and while one division captured the horse barracks, and secured the cavalry, another was to take possession of the barracks occupied by the infantry, who were also to be secured; the civil authorities were at the same moment to be made prisoners, and the principal inhabitants of the town confined to their dwellings by the new provisional government. This desperate project, wicked and visionary as it may appear, was undoubtedly formed, and the capture of Huddersfield, with the stoppage of the coaches usually passing through that place, were to form the signals for the general rising ! About II o'clock at night, all the divisions were in motion; the northern division, some of the sections of which had roused the peaceable inhabitants from their beds, and collected arms from them in their route, assembled in Fixby-Park, to the number, probably, of 200 or 300; the southern division had approached, but never, it appears, reached Almondbury-bank. The advanced-guard of the western division had, before 12 o'clock, taken their station at Greenhead, on the height which commands Huddersfield, and is within half a mile of the town ; while the main body of that division was stationed on Lindley-Moor. In speaking of numbers it is extremely difficult to attain to anything like precision, but it is confidently asserted that there could not be fewer than five or six hundred men in the whole of this division. To the east the numbers were less formidable, and perhaps would not exceed from one to two hundred. When they had mustered at their ren- dezvous, near the Obelisk, on the Leeds and Huddersfield road, at the entrance to the Clifton-road by the way of Kirklees, they were passed by five persons in the neighbourhood, who had been at Middlestown on business, and were on their return home about half-past 11 o'clock at night. The attention of these gentlemen was first excited by seeing several persons standing in the road, apparently in consultation, but none of them with arms in their hands. In turning up the lane towards Brighouse, two of the gentlemen, of the names of Smith and Brearley, observed a number of men sitting under the walls, and at the same time saw, by the light of the moon, a glittering of spears. So unusual a sight, at this late hour of the night, induced them to stop, and Mr. Smith put out his hand towards one of the pikes, to ascertain what it was, on which he re ceived a violent blow with the sharp edge of the pike, which cut his hand desperately, and induced him and his companion to hurry off, crying out "Help." This cry brought back the three other gentlemen, who were proceeding forward towards Cooper-bridge, and on coming near to the Park-wall, one of them, Mr. Robert Tolson, a master-manufacturer at Dalton, put his foot upon a bundle of pikes, and inquired what was there. The reply was given by a violent stroke, several times repeated, with one of the pike-handles, and at length a fellow, more desperate than the rest, made a thrust at him with a pike, which, taking a slanting direction, inflicted upon him a wound about the middle of the back, at the left side, about two inches in length and half an inch deep. On seeing his friend so ill treated, Mr John Hinchcliffe stepped up to his assist- ance, but finding that they were likely to be overpow- ered, they made off, though not till a pistol had been fired at Mr. Hinchcliffe, the ball from which he heard distinctly whiz past his ear. With some difficulty Mr. Tolson was got to Mr. Thomas Atkinson's, the Captain Commandant of the Huddersfield troop of Yeomanry Cavalry, where his wound was dressed, and he was some time afterwards enabled to return home, having suf- fered much less than might have been expected, Before midnight the magistrates were all assembled at the George Inn, the cavalry, which consists of one troop of the 4th Dragoon Guards, under Capt. Sibthorp, and the infantry, of three companies of the 85th Regiment of Foot, under Capt. Welling, were called out, while the Yeomanry Cavalry were summoned from their homes at a short notice. Soon after two o'clock, the beacon on the Castle-hill, which seems to have consisted of a quantity of shavings smeared with combustible matter, and hoisted on a pole, was fired. For some time the approach of the insurgents, to take possession of the town, was every moment expected ; two or three sky-rockets had been observed to rise before this hour, and frequent reports of fire-arms were heard extending along the banks of the river to a considerable distance; but from some cause, which is not yet fully ascertained, the insurgents began to disperse in every direction, and the meditated attack upon the town was abandoned. This abrupt termination of an enterprize which appeared so menacing has been accounted for in different ways :- according to some, the preparations made by the magistrates and the mili- tary had intimidated the insurgents; another supposi tion is, that the brightness of the moon, which shone with unusual lustre on that night, prevented the signals from being distinctly seen ; and another, and perhaps the most probable of all, is, that the leaders of these infatuated men, either from cowardice or treachery, forsook them in the moment of trial. As the morning approached, several parties of horse and foot-soldiers were sent out to reconnoitre the country, and to pick up stragglers, but not a single prisoner was made during the night, and it is a little remarkable that, with the exception of the outrage in Kirklees-lane, and the stealing of arms and other offensive weapons, no excess or depredation whatever was committed in the wide circuit over which this rising extended. The following persons were taken into custody on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday :- Joseph Barker, of Coln-Bridge, with his two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, who are all blacksmiths, and are charged with the fabrication of pikes, and with joining in the rising.- John Lindley, of Mirfield, nail-maker, on a similar charge. Thomas Blackburn, of Mirfield.-Nathaniel Buckley, of Ledger Bridge, a journeyman clothier.- Joseph Jessop and Samuel Jessop, of Hollinshall, Kirkheaton; and Joshua Hirst, of Deighton, all of whom are charged with having been in arms on the night of the 31st ult. A great many persons out of the disturbed villages have, we understand, absconded, in consequence of the part they have taken in these lawless proceedings, and the extent of the mischief to the distressed families of these infatuated men, is incalculable. The persons already apprehended, will, we understand, be committed to York Castle; but the Magistrates wait a reply from Government before they decide whether to make out the committals for high treason, or simply for a misdemeanor. It is remarkable, that in the populous vil!ages of Honley. Berry-brow, Holmfirth, and along the valley of Smithwaite, where, on former occasions, a good deal of agitation has prevailed, the people do not seem to have made any movement whatever; and some of them, it is said, with a mixture of wisdom and pleasantry, observed to the instigators, that they would wait till the next morning, to see how the new Government went on. We hope, that in future, all their neighbouring villagers will be as wise as themselves, and all wait till the following morning. In the midst of all this external commotion, there does not appear to have been the least symptom of riot or disaffection in the town of Hudders- field itself, during the night of Friday-all was perfectly quiet there, except when the parading of the military broke in upon the general stillness, and apprized the wondering inhabitants of the danger with which they were menaced. The arms hitherto captured by the military, amount only, we believe, to three pike heads, a few side arms and fire arms, and several pike handles, with two or three scythe blades, fastened into shafts. The pikes are about nine inches long, resembling the head of a halbert, with a screw at the end, to fasten into an iron socket, which is rivetted at the top of the pike-handle, and the handles are from six to eight feet in length, some of them formed of ash plants, and others of deal, rather thicker than the handle of a hay-fork. None of of the pikes which have been found, are formed to cut a horse's bridle ; but we have reason to suppose that there are some such instruments, as an attempt, apparently by the way of experiment, was made with one of them to cut a gentleman's bridle, who was last Sunday night riding between Thornhill and Kirkheaton, but which, missing the rein, caught the gentleman's pantaloon, and tore it from the knee to the ancle.

 There is some reason to suppose that arms have been clandestinely introduced into the neighbourhood of Huddersfield for some time past, but to what amount is not known. On the day preceding that on which the villagers assembled in hostile array, a parcel came to Huddersfield by the Regular Coach, addressed to " John Payne, Castlegate, Huddersfield." Owing to a defect in the package, the end of a bayonet jutted out of the paper ; this circumstance arrested the atten- tion of Mr. Whitehead, the Deputy Constable, who waited at the coach-office till it was called for by one Gill, the servant of Payne, who is a hawker, when it was opened in his presence, and found to contain two brace of pistols, three bayonets, two bullet moulds, one for musket and the other for pistol balls, and two gun locks. There was also an invoice inclosed, from which it appeared that these articles were charged at about one-half the usual price. In consequence of this discovery, Gill underwent an examination before the Magistrates, and was held to bail. Since Friday night there have been no symptoms of disturbance in the town or neighbourhood of Hudders- field, with the exception of some expression of popular disfavour towards the Yeomanry, who were assailed on Tuesday last with loud hisses in the street, in consequence of which the town for some time wore an alarming appearance, but this appears to have been a mere ebulltion, and the public peace was almost instantly restored. A person from Honley, who was said to have distinguished himself in raising the clamour, was persued by a mounted Yeoman into a tobacconist's shop, and being apprehended, was held to bail. On Wednesday night last, at seven o'clock, the Magistrates of Huddersfield, Joseph Haigh, Benjamin Haigh Allen, and John Horsfall, Esqs. convened a meeting of the inhabitants, at the George Inn, intimating that they had a communication to make to them of considerable imortance. At this meeting, about 100 of the principal inhabitants and tradespeople of the town attended, and Mr. Haigh having taken the chair, he proceeded to state - That the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield were in a state so alarming as to call for the greatest vigilance on the part of the respectable inhabitants. It appeared, he said, not from vague rumour, but from depositions taken before the Magistrates, that a simultaneous rising was to take place throughout all the manrufacturing districts of the kingdom, extending even to Scotland, and that the signal for that rising was to have been the capture of Huddersfield and the stoppage of the coaches. The Magistrates, he said, had certain information that there on Friday night last from 1,600 to 2,000 persons in arms in the neighbourhood of Huddersfieid, whose object it was, to change by force the existing order of society, and to rob and plunder the respectable part of the community. A delegate, whom they well knew, and on whom they had kept an eye, had come over from Nottingham to that place, on Thursday, the 30th ult. and had convened a meeting of delegates, at which twenty were present. On the meeting being dissolved, these men were despatched into various parts of the country, and each of them had a ticket given to him, on which was written a significant word (which the chairman mentioned, but which it may perhaps not be advisesable to state in a public newspaper,) and these cards when cut in two, were to form a sign and counter-sign by which the leaders were to be known. From causes which could not at present be explained, the wicked designs of the lawless had been hitherto frustrated, but there was no reason to suppose that their intentions had been altered.- Or :'Its this allrnirmng etate of tistigsgoit becanse site dnity liti ?? of site inlhabitants to utiito fnir tie preservatohie f tiseirwi lavso, their personsantsi'their property, ?? this meeting was called to obtai tirie satisfaction of the inhabitants CO bs'to an application to be tiade by rite ?? to site Iso n''Lord-lieutenaint, for powers to bring itorooperatison, if hisi it it should be found necessary, and certainly not otherwise, the waftit and tardatclat, in this district.

This was the substance of the communication, and it is scarcely necessasy to add, that the merting instantly gave them their sanction to the application to the Lord-lietutenant. In the course of the communication the Chsirman very candidly admitted, that ed libe did not believe that the reformers, as a body, had es apy thing to do with the conspiracy, which had spread out sueh very general dstd weih-fsctndrcl altirns through the th??neigbbourhood—the conspirators were the mete dregs pit s of society. - . . 3 Though we have already bestowed vupon this subject in I inmoreoom thsus we can well afford, yret wee cannot qult ?? t it witl out a few~ obeervacisna.

This mystery we hope the magistrates, who seem to have displayed great zeal and intelligence, will endeavour fearlessly to unltavel, and let the gult reilt th Is wherever it may happen to falL It is in vain to punish a few poor, ignorant, half starved, dupes. The terrors of their own minds, and the distresses of their families, will teach them it is to be hoped, never again to embark in such med and wicked projects, but if some of sh Li the beads can be laid hold of, and exposed or brought to justice, an essential benefit will be rendered to society. It would be Imoindid to deny tiba there is a great degree of disaffection in the country; and it would be equally uncandid to conceal, that the main cause of this disaffection is the extent of the public distress. Something must be done to restore the national prosperity, and to revive our almost extinct trade and manufactures. The public debt is a millstone so heavy, that if not diminished, it will sink the country. Mr. M i'lcardo's plan, or some other plan of a similar nature, an lmust sooner or later be adopted; and we do beseech the Legislators of the country to save us from anarchy on the one hand, or from military role cin the other, by turning their undivided attention instantly to this topic, on and by making it one of the first subjects of their deliberations on the meeting of the new Parliament.

Exeter Flying Post - Thursday 13 April 1820

DISTURBANCE AT HUDDERSFIELD.

For several days past the inhabitants of Leeds have been in a state of agitation, from the alarming indications in the neighbourhood.

On Friday last, the Magistrates received information that great nxumbers of the lower orders in the neighbourhood were armed with pikes and pistols, and that an attack before the town was to be made in the course ot the night by several bodies of pike men, 200 in each. Arrangements for defence were accordingrly made, and detachments of the 85th Infantry and 4th Dragoon Guards were on the alert, and late in the evening the yeomanry were called out. At two o'clock in the morning of Saturday, a fire balloon, the appointed signal of the insurgents, was observed in the direction of the Castle-hill. At the same time several parties of men were seen advancing upon the town in regular order; none of them, however, entered it. The nearest approach was the advance of one column to the Marsh turnpike. It is probable the insurgents were deterred by the preparations of the magistrates.

Two large bodies assemnbled. on Barkisland common, and proceeded as far as Lindby loor, but not being joined by sotl- parties they expected, they retired, discharging their fire-arms by way of bravado. On the evening of Friday, a gentleman, who was returning from :diddleton to his residence at Cooper's-bridge, in company with a gam-ekeeper and three travelers, whom he had overtaken on the road, passed 15 or 16 ren in a square, sfaundim t near Kirklees, the old rendezvous of the Luddites before they burnt Mr. Cartwrighit's mill. Two of the gentlemens' companions turned off the road, and, accompanied by the other three, he proceeded about 100 Yards, when they were alarmed by the cries of their late fellow traveller. On returning, they were suirprised to see a nunmber of men ?? muider a hedge ?? armed witlh pikes, and about o00 of these weapons lying on the ground; at the same time upwards of 60 persons S armed in the same manner canme over an adjoining wall. The gentleman, who was here separated from his companions, took up one of the pikes to examine it, when he received a blow from one of the pikemen, and was attacked by several others: .N a shot was also fired at him, the ball of which passed close to his head. The rest of his party were in the mean time cruelly beaten, and one of them, named Talson, received several pike wounds among the rest a danoerous stab in the side; he is now under the care of a surgeon. .r Informations were next day sworn by the sufferers, and a blacksmith was apprehended and fully identified as one of the aggressors. During the whole of Saturday the vigilante and activity of the Magistrates were indiefatigable; large quantities of pikes and pike-staves were (le- I tectedl. The pikes are extremely coarse and clumsy, fitted with a screw, by which they can be fixed into a handle. The staves are generally about seven feet long, and have btee recently stolen from plantations in the neigbourhood. About four miles from Huddersfield, another assembly was observed on Saturday night, but they dispersed before the military could be brought to act against them. Nine Persons have been taken into custody, who will, we understand, be committed to York Castle; but the Magmistrates wait a reply from Government before they decide whether to make out the com- mittals for high treason, or simply for a mnisdemeanour.

*From the Leeds Mercury, April 8.*

On Wednesday night last, at seven o'clock, the Magistrates of Huddersfield, Joseph Haigh, Benjamin Haigh Allen, and John Horsfall, Esqrs. convened a meeting of the inhabitants at the George Inn, intimating that they had a comunication to make to them of very considerable importance. At this meeting, about 100 of the principal inhabitants and trades-people of the town attended, and Mr. Haigh having taken the chair, he proceeded to state-"That the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfiell were in a state so alarming as to call for the greatest vigilance on the part of the respectable inhabitants. It appeared, he said, not from vague rumour, but from depositions taken before the Magiastrates, that a simultaneous rising was to take place throughout all the manufacturing districtsof the kintgdomn, extending even to Scotland, and that the signal for that rising was to have been the capture of Huddersfield, and the stoppage of the coaches. The Magistrates, he said, had certain information that there were on Friday night last from 1,600 to 2,000 persons in arms in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, whose object was to chnange by force the existing order of society, and to rob and plunder the respectable part of the community. A delegate, whom they well knew, and on whom they had kept an eye, had come over from Nottingham to that place, on Thursday, the 8Oth ult. and had convened a meeting of delegates, at which twenty were present. On the meeting being dissolved, these men were dispatched into various parts of the country, and each of them had a ticket given to him, on which was written a significant word (which the chairman mentioned, but which it may perhaps not be advisable to state in a public newspaper), and these cards, when cut in two, were to form a sign and counter-sign by which the leaders were to be known. From causes which could not at present be explained, the wicked designs of the lawless bad been hitherto frustrated, but there was no reason to suppose that their intentions had been altered. In this alarming state of things, it became the dqty of the inhabitants to unite for the preservation of their laws, their persons, and their property; and this Meeting was called to obtain the sanction of the inhatitauts to an application to be made by the magistrates to the Lord Lieutenant, for powers to bring into operation, if it should be found necessary, and certainly not otherwise, the Watch and Ward Act in this district. He was persuaded that no other arguments would be required to obtain consent of the inhabitants to this measure, than the, mere statement, that had it not been for the timely discovery of the plot of Friday night, such were the diabolical designs of the conspirators tlat it was probable that not one of the persons present at this meeting would at this time have had a house to go into. This was the substance of the ccommunication, and it is scarcely necessary to add, that the meeting instantly gave their sanction to the application to the Lord LieutenanLt. In the course of the commnunication the Chairman very candidly admitted, that he did not believe that the Reformers, as a body, had any thing to do with the conspiracy which had spread such very general and well-founded alarm through the neigh hourhood— the conspirators were the mere dregs of society.

An account of meditated attack upon Huddersfield, by a large body of malcontents, was given in our Paper of Wednesday last. The *Leeds Mercury* of Saturday last contains a more circumstantial account of this alarming business, to which it adds the following particulars:— "The abrupt termination of an enterprise which appeared so menacing has been accounted for different ways; according some, the preparations made by the Magistrates and the military had intimidated the insurgents; another supposition is, that the brightness of the moon, which shone with unusual lustre on that night, prevented the signals from being distinctly seen; and another, and perhaps the most probable of all, is, that the leaders of these infatuated men, either from cowardice or treachery, forsook them the moment of trial. As the morning approached, several parties of horse and foot soldiers were sent out to reconnoitre the country, and to pick stragglers, but not single prisoner was made during the night, and it is a little remarkable, that, with the exception of the outrage in Kirklees-lane, and the stealing of arms and other offensive weapons, no excess depredation whatever was committed in the wide circuit over which this rising extended. The following persons were taken into custody on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday:— Joseph Barker, of Coln-bridge, with his two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, who are all blacksmiths, and are charged with the fabrication of pikes, and with joining the rising; John Lindley, Mirfield, nail-maker, on a similar charge; Thomas Blackburn, of Mirfield ; Nathaniel Buckley, of Ledger Bridge, a journeyman clothier; Joseph Jessop and Samuel Jessop, of Hollinshall, Kirkheaton; and Joshua Hirst, of Deighton, all of whom are charged with having been in arms on the night of the 31st ult.

A great many persons out of the disturbed villages, have, we understand, absconded in consequence of the part they have taken in these lawless proceedings, and the extent of the mischief to the distressed families of these infatuated men is incalculable. The persons already appi-ehended will, we understand, be committed York Castle; but the Magistrates wait a reply from Government before they decide whether to make out the committals for high treason, or simply for a misdemeanor. It remarkable, that in the populous villages of Honley, Berry-brow, Holmfirth, and along the valley of Slaithwaite, where, former occasions, a good deal of agitation has prevailed, the people do not teem to have made any movement whatever; and some of them, it is said, with a mixture of wisdom and pleasantry, observed to the instigators, that they would wait till the next morning, to see how the new Government went on. M e hope that in future all their neighbouring villagers will as wise as themselves, and all wait till the following morning. In the miidst of all this external commotion there does not appear have been the least symptom of riot ,or disaffection the town of Huddersfield itself, during the night of Friday—all was perfectly cjuiet there, except when the parading of the military broke in upon the general stillness, ami apprised the wondering inhabitants of the danger with which they were menaced. The arms hitherto captured by the military, amount only, we believe, three pike head*, u few side arms and fire arms, and several pike handles, with two three scythe blades, fastened into shafts. The pikes are about nine inches long, resembling the head of a halbert, with a screw at the end fasten info an iron socket, which is rivetted at the top of the pike-handle, and the .handles are from six to eight feet in length, some them formed of ash plants, and others of deal, rather thicker than the handle of a hay-fork. *• None of the pikes which have been found are formed to cot a horse’s bridle; but we have reason to suppose that there are some such instruments, an attempt, apparently by the way of experiment, was made witlr one of them cut a Genlleman’a bridle, who was last Sunday night riding between Thornhill and Kirkheaton, but which, missing the rein, caught the Gentleman’s pantaloon, and tore it from the knee to the ankle. •« Since Friday night there have been *ymplom* of divlurbmice the town or neighbourhood Huddersfield, with the exception some exjiresfion of popular disfavour towards the yeomanry, who were assailed Tuesday last with loud hisses in the street, in consequence of which the town for some time wore alarming appearance, but tins appears have been a mere ebullition, and the pul; c pea.’e was almost instantly restored. A person from Honley, who was said to have distinguished himself in raising the clamour, was pursued a mounted yeoman into a tobacconist’s shop, and being apprehended, was held to bail. On Wednesday night last, at seven o’clock, the Magislates of Huddersfield, Joseph Haigh, Benj. Haigh Allen, and John Horsfall, Esqrs. convened meeting of the inhabitants, at the George Inn, intimating that they had a communication to make to them of considerable importance. At this meeting, about 100 the principal inhabitants and tradespeople of the town attended, and Mr. Haigh having taken the chair, proceeded to state— I hat the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield were in a state so alarming as to call for the greatest vigilance on the part of the respectable inhabitants. It appeared, said, not from vague rumour, but from depositions taken before the Magistrates, that a simultaneous rising was to lake place throughout all the manufacturing districts the kingdom, extending even to Sotland, and that the signal for that rising was have been the capture of Huddersfield and the stoppage the coachs. The Magistrates, he said, had certain information that there were on Friday night last from 1,600 to 2,000 persona in arms in the neighbourhood Huddersfield, whose object it was to change force the existing order society, and to rob and plunder the respectable part of the community. A delegate, whom they well knew, whom they had kept an eye, had come over from Nottingham that place, Thursday, the 30th ult. and had convened a meeting of delegates, at which twenty were present. On the meeting being dissolved, these men were dispatched into various parts of the country, and each of them had ticket given to him, which was written a significant word Jwhich the Chairman mentioned, but which may perhaps not be advisable to state in a public newspaper), and these cards, when cutTn two, were form sign and countersign the leaders wore known. From causes winch could not present , be explained, the wicked designs of the lawless have been hitherto frustrated, but there was no reason suppose thattbeir intention* had been altered. In this alarming stale ,i>f things, it became the duly of the inhabitants to unite for the their laws, their persons, and their property, and this meeting was railed obtain the sanction of > I lie inhabit ants application made by the Magistrates to the Lord Lieutenant, for powers bring into operation, if it should found sary, and certainly not otherwise, the .Watch and Ward Act, this district. He was persuaded that, other arguments would required to obtain the consent of the inhabitant* to this measure, Shan the mere statement, that had not been for the timely discovery of the plot of Friday night, such were the diabolical designs the conspirators, that was probable that not one of the persons present at this meeting would at ll|i»-lime have had a house into. This was the the Communication, and it is scarcely necessary to add, that the meeting instantly gave them their sanction the application the Lord Lieutenant. In the course of the communication the Chairman very candidly admitted, that did nut believe that the reformers, a body, had any thing with the conspiracy, which had spread such very general and well-founded alarm through the neighbourhood—the conspirators were the mere dregs of society."

New Times (London) - Tuesday 11 April 1820

HUDDERSFIELD, APRIL 7. [FROM THE LEEDS MERCURY,, APRIL 8.1 The town of Huddersfield and its neighbourhood have been suddenly thrown into a state of considerable agitation and alarm. The civil authorities and the military power have been kept upon the alert day and night ever since Friday last, and the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants are preparing to cooperate with them, either as special constables, or under the eatablislunent of the Watch and Ward Act, for the security of their lives and property, and the maintenance of the public peace. For three weeks past the Magistrates have had information that a simultaneous rising was intended in the manufacturing districts of the kingdom; and in the course of last week It came to our knowledge, that emissaries were going about the country exciting the people to arm, and preparing them for some desperate enterprise. We lost no time in apprising the readers of this Journal of the approaching mischief, and in putting the unwary upon their guard against the instigators; but this caution, as far as respected a very populous part of this district, was too late; for on the night preceding our last day of publication, the insurgents had assembled in arms, and were preparing to strike a blow, at the contemplation of which the mind recoils with horror. In a matter of this magnitude, we could not satisfy ourselves with intelligence derived through the ordinary channels, but we determined to investigate the business in person upon the spot, and the following is the result of our information collected from the most authentic sources : , A very unusual sensation was observed in many of the villages in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, towards the evening of Friday, the 31st ult. The women were seen passing about to each other's houses, many of them in tears, and several of the men appeared unsettled, as if meditating some daring enterprise. The Magistrates of Huddersfield, without knowiag the precise time when, or the place where, the blow was to be struck, were informed of these indications by their agents, male and female; and the military, throughout the whole of the manufacturingdistricts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, were, we believe, that night under arms. About ten o'clock that night, the general muster commenced, and the initiated, in a great number of the populous villages, by vs hich the town of Huddersfield is surrounded, •began to assemble, many of them armed with pikes, some of them with fire-arms, and others with sithes and pitch-forks, purloined from the neighbouring farm-yards and out-buildings. In some districts the bugle was heard to sound through the valleys, as the signal for muster, but the more general practice was to go to the houses of those who were known, or supposed to be favourable to the design of the Redicals, to press il.to the service the head of the • family. In some instances force, and it many others threats,. 'were used, to swell the ranks of the disaffected ; and not a few of theTersons called upon escaped out of their windows, in the rear of their houses, and relieved themselves from further importunity by finding concealment in the adjoining woods. The plan of operations was, it seems, to approach the town in four divisions. The Kirkheaton, Skelmanthorp, Grangemoor, and,Kirkburton sections, which may be called the South division, were to assemble at Almondbury-bank. within _a mile of thecentre of the town. The Mirfield, Hartshead, Hightown, and Coln , bridge sections, forming the Last division, were to rendezvous in Kirklees-lane, adjoining to the park of Sir George Armitage. Bart. which is three miles from Huddersfield. The Themahill. Dalton, Kirkheaton. Raistrick,- and Brighouse sectivr i s, forming the North division, were to assemble in Fixbypark , nearly two miles from that place; and the West division, which was the most numerous, and consisted of the Lind-Quarmby, Out-lane, Ripponden, and Bark-island • seclions, were to assemble on Lindley-moor, about the same distance from Huddersfield, and all of them having in view the Castle-hill, on which a beacon_ was to be lighted as the s_„ifTnal for the commencement of the march upon the town.. Having thus surrounded the town, au the parties were to.advance at the same moment, and while one division captured the horse-barracks, and secured the cavalry, another was to take possession of the barracks occupied by the infantry, who were also to be secured; the Civil Authorities were at the same_mo- ment to be made prisoners, and the principal inhabitants of the town confined to their dwellings by the new Provisional Government. This desperate project, wicked and visionary as it may appear, was undoubtedly formed; and the capture of Huddersfield, with the stoppage of the coaches usually passing through that place, were to form the signals for the general rising! About ten o'clock at night, all the divisions were in motion: the northern division, some of the sections of which had roused the peaceable inhabitants from their beds, and collected arms from them in their route, assembled in Fixby-park, to the number, probably, of 200 or 300; the southern division had approached, but never, it appears, reached Almondbury-bank. The advanced guard of the western division had, before 12 o'clock, taken their station at Greenhead, on the height which commands Huddersfield, and is within half a mile of the town; while the main body of that division was stationed on Lindley-moor. In speaking of numbers, it is extremely difficult to attain to any thing like precision, but it is confidently asserted that there could not be fewer than five or six hundred men in the whole of this division. To the east the numbers were less formidable, and perhaps would not exceed from one to two hundred. When they had mustered at their rendezvous, near the Obelisk, on the Leeds and Huddersfield-road, at the entrance to the Cliftonroad, by the way of Kirklees, they were passed by five persons in the neighbourhood, who had been at Middlestown on business, and were on their return home about half past eleven o'clock at night. The attention of these gentlemen was first excited by seeing several persons standing in the road, apparently in consultation, but none of them with arms in their hands. In turning up the lane towards Brighouse, two of the gentlemen; of the names of Smith and Brearley, observed a number of men sitting under the walls, and at the same time saw, by the light of the moon, a glittering of spears. So unusual a sight, at this late hour of the night, induced them to stop, and Mr. Smith put out his hand towards one of the pikes, to ascertain what it was, on which he, received a violent blow with the sharp edge of the pike, which cut his hand desperately, and induced him and his companion hurry off, crying out "Help." This cry brought back the three other gentlemen, who -were proceeding forward toward Cooper-bridge; and on coming near to the Park-wall, one of them, Mr. Robert Tolson, a taaster-manufacturer at Dalton, put his foot upon a bundle of pikes, and inquired what was there. The reply was given by a violent stroke,. several times repe ,ted, with one of the pikehandles; and at length a fellow, more desperate than the rest, made a thrust at him with a pike , which taking a slanting direction inflicted upon him a wound about the middle of the back, at the left side, abotrt two inches in len g th, and half an inch deep. On seeing his friend so ill treated, Mr. John Hinehcliffe stepped up to his assistance, but finding that they were likely to be overpowered, they made off, though not till a pistol had been fired at Hinchcliffe, the ball from which he heard distinctly whiz past his ear. With some difficulty Mr. Tolson was got to Mr. Thomas Atkinson's, the Captain Commandant of the Huddersfield Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry, where his wound was dress, d, and he was some time afterwards enabled to return home, having suffered much less than might have been expected. Before midnight the Magistrates were all assembled at the George Inn; the malty, which consists of one troop of the 4th Dragoon Guards, under Captain Sibthorp, and the infantry of three companiesof the Blith Regiment of Foot, under Captain Welling, we called out, while the Yeomanry cavalry were summoned from their houses at a short notice. Soon after two o'clock the beacon on the Castle-hill, which seems to have consisted of a quantity of shavings smeared with combustible matter, and heisted ort a pole, was fired. For some time the approach of the Insurgents, to take possession of the town, was every moment expected; two or three sky-rockets had been ob serve d to rise before this hour, and frequent reports of fire-arms were heard extending along the banks of the River to a considerable distance; but _from some cause, which is not yet fully ascertained, the Irn - prgents began to disperse in every direction, and the Meditated attack upon the town was abandoned. This abrupt termination of an enterprise which appeared so menacing, kas been accounted for in different ways: according to some, the preparations made by the Magistrates and the military had intimidated the Insurgents; another supposition is, that the brightness of the moon, which shone with unusual lustre on that night, prevented the signals from being distinctly seen; and another, and perhaps the most probable of all, is, that the leaders of these infatuated men, either from cowardice or treachery, forsook them in the moment of trial. As the morning approached, several parties of horse and foot soldiers were sent out to reconnoitre the country, and to pick up stragglers, but not a single prisoner was made during the night; and it is a little remarkable that, with the exception of the outrage in Kirklees-lane. and the stealing of arms and other offensive weapons, no excess or depredation whatever was committed in the wide circuit over which this rising extended. The following persons were taken into custody on Saturday, Sunday, and .Monday: Joseph Barker, of Coln-bridge, with his two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, who are all blacksmiths, and are charged with the fabrication of pikes, and with joining in the rising. John Lindley, of Mirfield, nail-maker, on a similar charge. Thomai Blackburn, of Mirfield; Nathaniel Buckley, of Ledger-bridge, a journeyman clothier; Joseph Jessop and Samuel Jessop, of - Hollinshall, Kirkheaton ; and Joshua Hirst, of' Deighton, all of whom are charged with having been in arms on the night of the 31st ult. A great many persons out of the disturbed villages haves we understand, absconded in consequence of the part they have takeb in these lawless proceedings. It is remarkable, that in the populous villages of Honley, Berry-brow, Holmfirth, and along the valley of Slaithwaite, where, on former occasions, a good deal of agitation has prevailed, the people do not seem to have, made any Movement whatever; and , some of them, it is said, with a mixture of wisdom and pleasantry, observed to the instigators, that they would'ivait till the next, morning, to see how the new, Government went on. In the midst of all this external commotion, there does not' appear to have been the least symptom of riot or disaffection in the town of Huddersfield itself, during the night of Friday; all was perfectly quiet there, except when the parading of the military broke in upon the general stillness,- and apprised the wondering inhabitants of the danger with which they were menaced. The arms hitherto captured by the military amount only, we believe, to three pike-heads, a few side-arms and fire-arms, and several pike-handles, with two or three sithe-blades, fastened into shafts. The pikes are about nine inches long, resembling the head of a halbert, with a screw at the end, to fasten into an iron socket, which is rivetted at the top of the pike-handle, and the handles are from six to eight feet in length, some of them formed of ash plants, and others of deal, rather thicker than the handle of a hay-fork. None of the pikes which have been found are formed to cut a horse's bridle; but we have reason to sup • pose that there are some such instruments, as an attempt. apparently by the way of experiment, was made with one of them, to cut a gentleman a bridle, who was last Sunday night riding be • tween Thornhill and Kirkheaton, but which, missing the rein, caught the gentleman's pantaloon, and tore it, from the knee to the ancle. _ There is some reason to suppose that arms have been clandestinely introduced into the neighbourhood of Huddersfield for some time past, but to what amount is not known. On the day preceding that on which the villagers assembled in hostile array, a parcel came to Huddersfield by the Regulator coach, addressed to "John Payne. Castlegate, Huddersfield." Owing to a defect in the package, the end of a bayonet jutted out of the paper; this circumstance arrested the attention of Mr. Whitehead, the Deputy Constable, who waited at the coach-office till it was called for by one Gill, the servant of Payne, who is a hawker, when it was opened in his presence, and found to contain two brace of pistols, three bayonets, two bullet-moulds—one for muskets and the other for pistol balls, and two gun-locks. There was also an invoice inclosed, from which it appeared that these articleswere charged at about one-half the usual price. In consequence of this discovery, Gill underwent an examination before the Magistrates, and was held to bail, Since Friday night there have been no symptoms of disturbance in the town or neighbourhood of Huddersfield, with the exception of some expression of popular disfavour towards the Yeomanry, who were assailed on Tuesday last with loud hisses in the street. in consequence of which the town for some time wore an alarming appearance, but this appears to have been a mere ebullition, and the public peace was almost instantly restored A person from flonley, who was said to have distinguished himself in raising the clamour, was pursued by a mounted Yeoman into a tobacconist's shop, and, being apprehended, was held to bail. On Wednesday night last, at seven O'clock, the Magistrates of HudderSfield, J. Haigh, B. H. Allen, and John Horsfall„ Esqrs. convenJd a meeting of the inhabitants, at the George Inn, intimating that they had a cornmunication to make to them of Considerable importance. At this meeting about 100 of the principal inhabitants and tradespeople of the town attended. and Mr. Haigh having taken the chair, it appeared, he said, not from vague rumour, but from depositions taken before the Magistrates, that a simultaneous rising was to take place throughout all the manufacturing districts of the kingdom, extending even to Scotland, and that a signal for that rising was to have been the capture of Huddersfield, and the stoppage of the coaches. The Maristrates; he said, had certain information that, there were, on Friday night last, from 1600 to 2000 persons in arms in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, whose object It was to change by force the existing order of society, and to rob ,and , plunder the respectable part of the community. A delegate, whom they well knew, and on whom they had kept an eye, had , come over from Nottingham to that place, on Thursday the 30th ult. and had convened a meeting of delegates, at which 20 weri present. On the meeting being dissolved, these men were dispatched into various parts of the country, and each of them had a ticket given to him, on which was written a significant word (which the chairman mentioned, but which it may, Teri:laps, not be advisable to state in a public newspaper,) and these cards, when cut in two, were to form a sign and countersign by which the leaders were to be known. From causes which could not at present be explained, the wicked designs of the lawless had been hitherto frustrated, but there was no reason to stippose that their intentions had been altered. In this alarming state of things it became the duty of the inhabitants to unite for the preservation of their laws, their persons, and their property ; and this meeting was called to 'obtain the sanction of the inhabitants to an application to be made by the Magistrates to the Lord-Lieutenant for powers to bring into operation, Wit . should be found necessary, arid certainly not otherwise, the 'Watch and Ward Act in this district. This was the substance of the communication, and it is scarcely isecessary'to add, that the meeting instantly gave their sanction to the application to the Lord-Lieutenant In the course of the application, the Chairmain very candidly admitted, that he did not believe that the ,Reformers, as a body, had any thing to do with the conspiracy, which had spread such -very general and well-founded alarm through . the neijhbourhood---the conspirators were the mere dregs of society.

Sun (London) - Tuesday 11 April 1820

PROVINCIAL JOURNALS.

The following is an extract from the *Leeds Intelligencer* of yesterday, a paper always marked by good information and sound principles. The *Mercury*, to which it refers, is a Journal of so different a description, that it is well for the town that the former paper exists to counteract the *radical* tendency of the latter. But if the *Mercury* gives such an account of the *intention* of the *Radicals*, there can be little reason to doubt its correctness, and it is therefore rather surprising that a Radical Journal should so openly have developed that intention.

"We last week communicated to our readers, the alarming intelligence relative to the designs of the disaffected in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. Several of the London Editors have insinuated, that, although there might be some ground for the suspicions of the Magistrates, yet, that the greatest part of our narrative must be fictious. We, however, can inform these gentlemen, who would scout all idea of danger till it has entered our very houses, that instead of exaggerating, we *under-rated*, the extent of the contemplated insurrection, and the consequent alarm; and that every subsequent account has more than confirmed our previous statements. We would refer those who are inclined to suspect the truth of our narrative, and to question the existence of a disposition to rebellion and outrage, to the *Mercury* of Saturday last. They will there find a detailed plan of operations, by which the town of Huddersfield was to be approached on the North, West, East, and South sides; and (says the Editor),—

"Having thus strrounded the town, all the parties were to advance at the same moment, and while one division captured the horse barracks, and secured the cavalry, another was to take possession of the barracks occupied by the infantry, who were also to be secured: the Civil Authorities were at the same moment to be made prisoners, and the principal inhabitants of the town confined to their dwellings by the new Provisional Government. This desperate project, wicked and visionary as it may appear, was undoubtedly formed, and the capture of Huddersfield, with the stoppage of the coaches, usually passing through that place, were to form the signals for the general rising!"

"We think the above must convince the most sceptical, as to the actual existence of a conspiracy of a very atrocious nature; a conspiracy which, but for the vigilance of the Magistrates, would have involved in ruin and misery a populous town, and perhaps occasioned the loss of thousands of lives! Nor was it in Huddersfield alone that the enemies of social order, and of the Constitution, were at work. Our accounts from Scotland state, that a simultaneous rising was expected in the vicinity of Glasgow, in which town (and also in Paisley and the neighbouring villages) the workmen left their employ, at the command of an anonymous incendiary, declaring they would not return till their grievances were redressed.— These towns were kept in a state of alarm for three or four days; and we have details to lay before our Readers, which will prove that those alarms were not groundless."
