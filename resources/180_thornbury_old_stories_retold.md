OLD STORIES RETOLD. `[By Walter Thornbury.—Chapman and Hall]`

On first glancing this very interesting wad vigorously written book, we are reminded of two well-known sayings. "Fact is stranger than fiction," and "The history their own time is just that of which ordinary people are most ignorant." What writer of sensation novels, what inventor of tales of murder, forgery, and the detective police, could produce stories more thrilling than these tragedies of real life? such os that of Sarah Malcolm, the charwoman, who murdered three persons in the Temple; Old Patch, the forger of bank notes, who assumed innumerable disguises, and who seemed be, like Mrs. Malaprop's Cerberus, "three gentlemen at once;" the wholesale murders in Ratcliffe Highway, which De Quincey has immortalised in his essay on"Murder as one of the Fine Arts;" Wainwright, the art critic and dandy, who used to insure the lives of friends and near relations in various offices, and then quietly and skilfully poison them with strychnine; Fauntleroy, the high bred gentleman, and great banker, who forged deeds upon a stupendous scale, and who was hanged at Newgate? Again, all us have heard something about the burning of the Kent, East Indiaman, the Cato-street conspiracy, the bombardment of Algiers, the Luddites, Burke and Hare the resurrection men, the Bristol riots, &c. — but very few people have more than hazy and traditional ideas about these occurrences. Mr. Thornbury's book thus supplies an acknowledged want, and gives us most clear and vivid accounts of many remarkable events of the last and the present century—wrecks, riots, trials, famines, and insurrections, about which the majority of us know little but the name. Some of the author's descriptions have wonderfully graphic force, and are equal anything of the kind in the best novels the day. Here is a spirited picture of attack by the Luddite rioters upon a Yorkshire mill, worthy of being pendant to the picture of the same subject in Charlotte Bronte's "Shirley."

"Mr, Cartwright, who had apprehensions of attack, was asleep in the great stone many-windowed building. The great water wheels were still, the only sound was the ripple of the water in the mill-dam. The alarm-bell, rising above the roof, stood out dork against the sky. There was no light at any window, and no noise. five workmen and their allies, the five soldiers, ware asleep. The armed men, intent on destruction, and ready for murder, to their design stole on like ghosts. Soon after twelve, Mr. Cartwright, who had just fallen asleep, was awoke by the violent harking of a large dog, kept chained inside the mill for such purpose.

"The mill-owner leaps out of bed to give the alarms he opens his bedroom door, he hears twenty or thirty of the three hundred panes of glass on the ground floor, shattered in: the same time there is a rattle and blaze of musketry the ground and upper windows. The bullets whistle, and splinter, and flatten against the immer walls. At the same time a score of sledge-hammers are heard working the chief door, and voices shouting and threatening at the other entrances, and indeed on all sides, except that which the mill pool lies.

"The hour is come at last. But Mr. Cartwright is Yorkshire too—resolute, bold, and of a good heart. shouts his men, they fly to arms, and load and cock their muskets. He and one or two of his work-people run. to the alarm-bell and pull fiercely the rope tiu dashes out its summons to the Hussars at Liversedge, and friends near and far."

This drives the Luddites stark staring mad the firing becomes hotter, and a dozen of them cry out—

"Fire the bell-rope! Shoot away the bell! that bell, get it lads!' For they knew the soldiers would be upon them soon with their sabres if that bell clanged many minutes longer. Presently the bell-rope breaks, and two men are sent up to clash the bell and fire alternately. Cartwright and his men fire from the upper loops of the mill obliquely the howling crowd that flash off their guns, and ply their hammers, and snap their pistols the detested mill, where the ten men are glaring at them under covert. The fire from and against the mill is hot, pelting, and furious."

The story of the loss of the Kent, East Indiaman, is most noble one, and full of thrilling and pathetic details. We cannot help contrasting the chivalry and perfect discipline of the officers and men on board her, with the cruelty and cowardice of many of those belonging the wrecked French vessel Medusa, of which also Mr. Thornbury tells the tale. There are several clever touches of character throughout the volume, the descriptions Wainwright, the dilettante fine gentleman and poisoner, who "had always been fond of cats," and the grave, intensely respectable, grey-haired Fauntleroy, are especially well done. We conclude with the portrait of the Lord Byron (great uncle of the poet), who killed Mr. Chaworth in duel.

"He left Westminster Hall with the brand of Cain upon his forehead. A mysterious and indelible stain was upon h'a escutcheon. The 'maccaronies' in the world fashion somehow shunned him, a whisper suspicion followed him wherever he went He retired into Nottinghamshire, and sank into sullen, gloomy, morose man. His passions grew more inveterate; he changed into a half-crazed, revengful, brooding misanthrope, a wicked Timon of Athens. always wont armed, as if dreading secret enemies. one occasion he is said, in rage, to have thrown his wife into the lake in front of the abbey, from which she was rescued the gardener, who then thrashed her savage husband. Another time he is said to have shot his coachman for disobeying orders, then to have thrown the bleeding body into the coach where Lady Byron was seated, and driven home himself. At war with.the human race, the wicked lord in 'austere and savage seclusion,' took refuge in the love of animals. He tamed immense number of crickets, whom he allowed to crawl over him, and corrected, when too familiar, with wisp of straw. When their patron died, there is a tradition that they left the Abbey altogether, flocking across the courts, corridors, and cloisters in all directions."

OLD STORIES RE-TOLD.* Mr. Thombury ltas dealt, in his “Old Stories Re toll,” very ; leasantly with a very unpleasant sevics of subects, He tells vs of the | ud(gtcs and their outrages ;of Thurtell, the gambler, and the cruel murder he perpetrat-d: of Sarah Malcolm, the murderess of ber mistress ; of old Patch, the forzer; of the fatal ducl between Lord Byron the grand uncle of the great roet of the same nome and Mr. Chaworth. of the great banker and forger, auntleroy, and of the myst.rious murder of M. ry ‘shford, ~ Then we have a ver, black list of political oTences und political offeaders, where we find an account of IZimmet's insurrection, in 1803, and the Irish Rebellion in 1708, the assassi nation of Mr, Perceval, the Prime Minister, in 1512; the burning of Wildgoose |odge co. Louth, Ireland) in 1510 ¢ the Cato-strect conspiracy in 1820, and the Bristol riots of 1831, When we add to these crimes the catistrophes of the wreck of the AZowia, in 1816, anl the loss of the KAewt East indiaman Ly fire in iB2), and a few murders an‘ other atrocities of lesser note, w shall have presented our readers with t:e whole subjcct-matter of Mr. Thornbury’s most interesting volume. To be, however, apjreciated as a whole it must be read as a whole. Itis impossible to read these terrible pictures of depravity and disaster without being deeply imxusscd with the consolatory reflections. In the first case, we are made to feel that human nature, even in its most oom:med phases, is still sxman, and not devilish, and that even some of the blackest criminals have some soft spotin their hard hearts, and are carable of acts of kindness, as well as susceptible of sincere religious feclings. It is to the credit of our author, and, we may add, to the delight of his readers, that so many cases are here pointed out in this dark calendar of crime which what is excellent in human character is mingled with what is corrupt. As no man is altogether good, so we believe that no man is altogether bad, and that he is the best man who has the greater proportion of what is best, and he the worst who has the greatest proportion of what is worst in human character, To our mind, the bright bits of redeeming sunshine thrown on the dark characters of his criminals is by far the best portion of these storics retold, and of this we will ll:'i"e our readers the benefit of a few examples. Fauntleroy, the wellknown London banker, was hanged, as we before observed, for forgery, in 1824. This unhap;;y man found the banking firm deeply involved when he entered it as a partner in 1817, His fwﬁﬁ“ were made to retrieve the position of the bank. “He never had embessled one shilling,” we are told, “forhimself.” Witnessesof the highest respectability were IProdut:ed at his trial who had known him ¥or a life time. All gave evidence to his honour and to his inwfi(y. “ A most benevolent man, with a stainless character.” Death was, we must confess, a very hard doom for a man of otherwise spotless reputation, whose onl( crime was a dishonest effort not to earich himself, but to maintain the credit of others, Here is a “ghastly anecdote” told of poor I'auntleroy, which we give in our author’'s own words :— e ‘¢ A ghastly anecdote, illustrative of the deep sincerity of dinner-friendships, and the pro‘ound attachment whereof boon companions are capable, long survived this miserable man, and was, within these twenty years, told for truth by one of his generation. His Jegnt dinners had been particularly renowned for some remarkable and unmatchable Curacoa, He had been frejuently asked at his own table of whom he bought it, but always kept the secret, When he was ordered for execution, three friends, bound to him by the remembrance of many feasts and many glasses of this famous liqueur, had a ;uai.li.i:tm' with him in his Condemned Cell. They had discharged themselves of such edifying remarks as they bad brought with them, and had taken their final leave of him and were about to retire, when the most impressive of the three stepped back, and said * Fauntleroy, you stand on the verge of the tomb, and Eternity awaits you, We brought nothing into this world, and itis certain we can :fe nothing out. At so supreme a moment, have you any objection to say how, and of whom, you procured that Curajoa? ' " In the murderer Burke (the Resurrection man), it is not less singular than pleasing to note hi friendly care and anxiety for his wife, which is not forgotten inthis sombre record of appalling horrors. Thurtell—the villain who murdered Mr. William Weare in 1823, in conjunction with Hunt, who turned King’s evidence—had the noble generosity to forgive the man who brought him to the gallows, and the night before his execution he shook him cordially by the hand, and said, “ God bless you, Hunt ; you have brought me to this situation, but I freely forgive you, and hope you will be mftieved and live to repent of your ¥m errors, If you had had nerve like us, none of us would have been convicted of this crime, but I for_Fihve you from the bottom of m{ heart.” e story of Sarah Malcolm, who murdered her mistress—a rich widow, Mrs. Duncombe—is, in truth, a sad story, but still relieved from something of its ghastly 3oom by such an incident as the following :— “ It was the custom at this time, pursuant to a bequest of Robert Dowe, a merchant tailor, for the bellman o St. Sepulchre’s to come to Ncwrrte a little past the mid. night before the execution of prisoners, to mﬁl his bell under the grated windows of the condemned hold, repeating the following well-meaning but doggrel verses; “ ¢ All you that in the condemn’d-hold do lie, Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die. Watch all and pray, the hour is drawing near, That you before th’ Almighty must appear, Examine well yoursclves, in time repent, That you may not t’ eternal flames be sent : And when St. 'Pulchre’s bell to-morrow tolls, The Lord above have mercy on your souls ! Past twelve o'clock !’ ¢ Some prisoner or turnkey speaking 'o Sarah Malcolm, and Liddin her mind what the bellman said, she replied that she dgid. When the bellman finished, she looked out of window, and cried - ¢ D'ye hear, Mr. Pellman, call for a pint of wine, and I'll throw you a shilling to \a{ for its’ ‘“She then lfuew down tﬁc sll\il ing. “On the Sunday night, about ten o'clock, she called to a man named Chambers--the prisoner condemned to dic the next day, and whose cell was opposite her window—and asked him if she should pray with him. He reﬂ‘i’ed-— Do, Sarah : let us pray with all our hearts.’ ““She then prayed fervently till all the candles * “Old S.orie; Re-told.” By Walter Thornbury, London: Chapman and Hall,

OLD STORIES RETOLD `[Old Stories Re-told. By Walter Thornbury, author of "Haunted London," &c., London: Chapman & Hail.]`

It was but the other day that reviewed admirable novel—“ The Vicar’s Courtship by Mr Walter Thornbury, and now another book, of a different character, by the same veraatile and industrious writer, lies before us. It is, as the title indicates, a collection of old stories retold—stones of actual events, episodes of social and political history—great crimes, memorable battles, tcmble disasters sea and land, nots, rebellions, conspiracies, and so forth-which, remarkable as they are, and forcibly as they must have impressed themselves on the minds of men when they occurred, have gradually faded from memory, until nothing is left of them but their barest outlines, and in some cases only their mere names or titles. It indeed strange how soon events the most memorable become forgotten. How many persons, to take some of Mr Thornbury s subjects as examples, remember the circumstances of the O. P. Hints of 1809. of the assassination of Mr Percival 1812, of the wreck of the Medusa in 1816, of the murder of William Weare Thurtell in 1823, of the burning of the Kent East Indiaman in 18251 Again, perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred selected at random from any large crowd or company, could not tell what was the cause and result of the duel between Lord Byron ami MrChawortb in 1765, and we undertake to say that not a few would be puzzled, if asked to state whether the Lord Byron in question was the poet of not. How many persons can name the date of the battle ot Vinegar Hill and the nationality and objects of the parties engaged in it, or have idea of the purpose the Cato Street Conspiracy, or of the crimes tor which Fauntlcroy was executed in 1824, or know what instigated the Bristol Riots of 1831, or what was their extent and effect But so it will be witr. the events passing under our own eyes, and in the course of a few years the memory of the worl I will lose its grasp of the details of such familiar f.icts the loss of the Royal Chatter, the murder of Mr Briggs by Muller, and of Mrs Sheward by her husband, the Fenian conspiracy and the shooting of Police-sergeant Brett at Manchester, and the outrage at Clerkenwell, the Reform League riots H.\de Park, and the Pantin massacre, together with all tbo moral lessons which these incidents suggest. One of these days, perhaps, the events of our own times will be dealt with Mr Thornbury has dealt wnth the events that excited society those of our fathers of the past three generations. To an able writer like him such subjects will furnish tempting themes, and, probably, the success with which he has revived tho forgotten half-forgotten stories he has re-told may induce others to follow in his footsteps. If any doubt coidd exist as to the propriety or exj*ediency of resuscitating these stories, it is removed the manner in which the resuscitation has been effected. Mr Thornbury certainly is not one of those who “mars a good story in the telling.” master of the art of graphic description he has few rivals, and he has shown his skill in this respect in no work more remarkably than in the vblumc before us. His style of narration is simple, without being commonplace or dry ; it is dramatic without being vulgarly sensational. He embellishes his subject not by flights of the imagination, but the sheer force of picturesque treatment. In perusing these stories his one cannot fail to be struck by the seeming paradox—that there is at once so much and yet so little of his own in them. But this is because, while he adheres closely to truth and fact—while his book is, it were, crammed (if such a term can be applied to what is perfect in order and arrangement) with historical detail, the manner of the narratives is fresh and novel as the subjects of them are old. The stories seem to tell themselves, so fertile arc their materials in interesting incident, but it is to the art of the narrator that we are indebted for the powerful and vivid impression which they make upon us. For example, what a perfect pictur —conceived in the true Hogarthian spirit —is the following sketch of brutal gambler-bully of the last century : Major Oneby wait neither the Eagle nor the Woodpecker. bad sank into the loweet all gamost Bally. was the bloat, frank old eoldi-r who talked Marlborough, by , air, and Prince Engine. had a groan humour of hie own, and told infamoae stories well, when he was neither quarrelsome nor dangerous.

Hr: uied dap bis sword the table, and glance round dertautly at the company. He would howl out blasphemiesaddressed to one specially, bat still amounting a challenge the fiercest or bravest man in the room. It was necessary to his reputation a terrorist that should kill a man now and then, and woe to the young Templar, vain his fencing, who that night came in his way. would volunteer show the youug country spendthrift the sights of the town. Some evening, after three or four of wine, the Deluder pr-tend-, with bis own jovial laugh, to be tired of Booth ami Q >in, Vauxhail and Kanelagh. of the Mall and the tracingschool, of the masquerade and the Park. Some peopls they meet by chance at Will’s turn out very lively acquaintances, with torn for faro or chicken h vzard. They adjourn to a gambling-house, and set work wi'h the dice and the red and black pipe. Mr Littlebram, tho rich yonng gentleman from 8 first wins surprisingly. The gold tide sets towards him. They call for more Burgundy. He instate on higher stakes, astonished to find how he is startling the old dice-shakers of Covent Garden. More Burgundy; the room seems to get lighter and larger ; the dice tiy out faster and fatter. The tide at last turns; the gold floats from him in shoals. He h.'s lost all bod won and five thousand guineas more, besides the large farm near Taunton, He has also signed some papers that good-natured old lawyer pereenk required as securities for the loan of another thousand, already half gone. Gradually the fumes of the wine subside, and one suspicious glance discloses to him the old lawyer changing a pack of cards which he (novice) had placed ready at bis elbow. He sees a friend make signs the benevolent lawyer. Then he feels into what a park wolves has fallen. In a moment Littlebrain dashes over his chair, leaps a settee, gets down his hat and sword from the peg behind the door, and shouts “Thieves!” from the window to the watch, who have jnst passed, crying, sleepily: Past four, and rainy morning,” The gang is furious, their eyes glare, they prepare for a The gallant captain, whose red face, barred with black plasters, looks like a hot fire seen between the bars of a grate, sweeps two or three dozen guineas from the green cloth into bis panniers of pockets. Then some one knocks out the lights, several swords clash with Littlebrain’s, and one passes through his unlucky body. He staggers to the stairs, and falls beadlong down them—dead. There a dash the watchmen, who threaten the gamblers with their staves. The old men, however, fall before the tempestuous charge, and the next moment there is no one in the gambliogkonse but two frightened women, old watchman, who is bolding the dim lantern to the dead man’s face with one hand, and removing bis watch and purse with the other; the only sonnd is the wind whistling through the keyhole. In such affairs, subtle, cruel, and deadly. Major Oneby has been no subordinate actor. In notbing does Thornbury show his skill to better advantage than in tales of crime and mystery. He is not content with a mere piling up of horrors, but he constructs, even out of the most revolting of his subjects such as the butcheries of Burke and Hare, and the murders Katcliffe Highway—tales that rise to the dignity of tragedy. In this way, his stories of crime ro- Femble not the hideous records of the Newgate Calendar, but the skillfully-elaborated narratives of Edgar Poe. We doubt whether even that accomplished historan of the terrible has ever “led up” to the climax of any of his tales of mystery with art more subtle than that which Mr Thornbury displays in many of his stories. The following tlirillmg narrative of the discovery of the murders by Sarah Malcolm, in the Temple, in 1733, is, in our opinion, a master piece of the art of story telling,.admirable for its play of light and shade, for the dexterity with which it seizes the attention and keeps it on the stretch of expectation, and tilla the mind with sense of impending calamity Exactly one on that Sunday, Mrs L'lve, neat and trim as Quaker, comes dine in Tanfield Court. She very punctual: it is exactly o’clock the great dials, and the St Donstan giante have just done their lightest work, and struck out with their dabs, clear, and loud. Mrs Love shulflee ivcr.>« the paved coart, and last reaches the special door with the name Lydia Duncomb in black on the door-post. N savoury smell of dinner greets her. She ascends the old dosty ink-splashed stairs;—one flight—that is Mr Knight’s door. Silent, all out for the Sunday ; second flight, she reals; third flight, here is the landing at last, and welcome enough to her poor old knees. Tnere Mr Grisly’s name still over his door—be is going to leave: and facing it, again, the well-known name of Mrs Lydia pun comb. It singular, though, as they cannot all nave gone to church, that Mrs I) an comb’s outer door is accident, doobt. Mrs Love knocks with the confidence of a punctual visitor, true to the dinner hour. Iso answer! It is very silent and lonesome there the top of the house, on the cold landing opposite Grisly’s unoccupied chambers. chill creeping of the bl(x*l comes over Mrs Love. Five, ten, fifteen minutes’ more knocking. No answer. Something must be the matter. Nanny must be out, and Mrs Betty ill in bed. too infirm to come the door, and too weak to call out load enough to heard. Down the three flights at last trots Mrs Love, see she can find anybody who has seen any one the family that morning, la the court whom should she meet but Mrs OliDhant, and she asks her at once. “No ” said Mrs Oliphaat, I have seen none of thtm ; yon’d belter knock louder.’* Up again goes Mrs Love, feeling sure that they will now be stirring. Skill all silent up the great stairs. She knocks again, nervously fast, till the whole staircase re-echoes, and from every empty room there seem to come voice*—shadowy faint voices—but no articulate answer. She waits. No •
