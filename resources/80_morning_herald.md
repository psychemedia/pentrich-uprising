THE LATE RIOTS.

The advices of yesterday from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, we are happy to, find, are of a very pacific nature.

The following is from a Derby Paper of Thursday:

We have this week to announce to our readers the rising of a number of those deluded people who have for some time threatened the peace of the country under the influence of the Hampden Clubs. At the same time we have the satisfaction to state, that from the vigilance with which the conspiracy had been watched, and the promptness with which it has been met, there remains no cause for alarm or apprehension to the loyal and well affected. To say more at this moment might be improper. A number of prisoners have been taken, and their cases are under investigation before the Magistrates."— *Derby Mercury.*.

EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM DERBY, JUNE 11.

"The symptoms of which were manifested yesterday seem to be quelled. It appears that two troops of hussars from Nottingham had arrived early yesterday at Langley Mill, where they found an assemblage of about three hundred persons, some having fire arms, others pikes, &c. The hussars charged the mob, who immediately dispersed; fifteen or sixteen of the ringleaders were taken and sent to Nottingham. Two troops of cavalry front Derby divided, one towards Ripley, and the other among the colliers near Hoanor. Between Ripley and Alfreton they found the Chesterfield troop actively employed, the dispersed  mob having made their appearance on their route, issuing threats, &c. Great numbers have been secured. Five or six were brought to Derby in the afternoon, and about nine o'clock last night twenty-nine more. Several were taken this morning, and every thing now appears quiet. The disturbance is supposed to have originated in the discharge of some men from Butterly Foundry, in consequence of belonging to some Jacobinical Club."

THE MORNING HERALD, LONDON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22.

At length, a discussion has taken place in the Court, at Derby, which we may presume to repeat, for it relates not to the proceedings on the indictment, but to the propriety of some garbled publications, which have been made of parts of them in an Evening and in a Morning Paper. Our own Report of this discussion is before us: but we take that given by the Evening Paper in question, the *Courier*, in order to be clear from any suspicion of unfairness to a Contemporary, whose ease and security, after an infraction of the Order, which we have obeyed, might excite considerable envy, were the occasion one of greater importance. From our own manuscript Report we have taken nothing but a paragraph, which is annexed to the proceedings of the day. If it were not, that Lives are depending upon the trials, we should say, that this discussion is the only part of the proceedings, that have hitherto taken place, at Derby, to which any great attention is due. From this we are persuaded a discussion will arise in another place, which will end in rescuing the press from a dilemma incompatible with even those claims to respectability which no party has ventured to call immoderate. The Court twice delivered a most emphatic, intelligible and comprehensive injunction against any publication of its proceedings. It will be seen, that their Lordships were informed by the Counsel for the prisoners of the publication of a garbled Report of the ATTORNEY GENERAL's speech. They were told of this violation of their order; they enquired whether the Counsel had any motion to make upon it, and, being informed, that he had none, they passed on to the other business of the day with a mere repetition of their injunction. The predicament, in which Newspapers have been placed by this proceeding, would be of the highest interest to them, (and other publications would he involved in it) if the occasion were one of much public importance; and it is obviously desirable, that some regulation should be soon formed, which may provide for future emergencies. The Order of Court did not say, that, if any motion were made against those, who should infringe it, the Court would notice their conduct; if it had, other Newspapers would not have been afraid to do more than the *Courier* did, for they would not have apprehended any such interference. It threatened offenders unconditionally with the displeasure of the Court. There was not the slightest allusion in it to exterior contingency, upon which their displeasure was to depend. It is only after some papers have obeyed and others have disobeyed the injunction, that this contingency is made known. The Judges have doubtless acted with good intentions, and their rule is, at present, the only law upon the subject. But we are not afraid to ask their Lordships, with all deference and general respect for their stations and characters, whether, upon consideration, they do not think they have erred? whether their injunction should not have expressed the condition, upon which it would be enforced? It is the great consolation of Englishmen, under the pressure of their many burdens, that they live under KNOWN LAWS. We ask, whether the law, in the present case, could have been understood from the terms of the injunction; and we trust, that we may, without offence, exhibit this remonstrance. We hope also, that the case will lead to the enactment of some Parliamentary Law, which shall form a clear guidance for Courts and for the press in future, when occasions of such importance may occur, that the latter could not be left in uncertainty, without serious danger to it's useful rights.

To these observations we are led simply by a desire of the future regulation, for which we call, not by any wish for severities, as to what is past. Happily the present occasion is so far from exciting more interest than ordinary trials upon capital charges, that we have suffered no detriment by our obedience to the Court; if we had, the personal inconveniences of our Contemporaries would not remedy it; and we rather think, that those whose conduct is in question, know us better than to suppose, that we could find any satisfaction in their vexations. The fact is, that our interest and the interest of the newspaper press in general lies on the other side of the question. The present proceedings at Derby attract so little attention, that, when the day comes, on which every Newspaper will give its fair and unrestrained Report of them, one hundred additional copies are not likely to be sold by the whole body of Morning and Evening papers. The entire value of the occasion to Newspapers, is that a clear regulation may arise out of it for the future. For the sake of that, it is our wish, that the injunction of the Court at Derby, and the administration of it, may remain exactly as they are, calling for the cognizance of Parliament by the uncertainty which ensues from them— the deficiency of KNOWN LAW— and leading to a measure, which shall promote the independence, as well as secure the liberty, of the press.

SPECIAL COMMISSION

Derby, October TREASON TRIALS

FIFTH DAY.

*William Turner* was the person selected by Officers of the Crown to be tried next. This man was formerly in the Militia, but having volunteered in the 20th Regiment of Foot, he has since been abroad, and in Egypt and elsewhere fought battles of his country. He is a tall man, 47 years of age.

He was brought from the gaol in the same manner as had been pursued with *Brandreth*, linked to the wrist of Mr. Eaton, jun. at about a quarter below eight. He did not shew the same degree of firmness as had been displayed by his predecessor at the bar, nor did his countenance exhibit the same marked characteristics. He is a man of plain appearance: he was dressed very decently, in a blue coat and coloured waistcoat.

The Court having assembled at eight o'clock, and the confusion resulting from the admission of the public, having subsided, the prisoner was put to the bar.

The Lord Chief Baron then called on the Attorney General and the Counsel for the Crown to proceed with their challenges.

PUBLICATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

Mr. DENMAN immediately rose, and addressed the Bench to the following effect:—

My Lords—I feel it to be my duty to call the attention of the Court to what I conceive to be a callous contempt of the order pronounced by your Lordships—calculated in my mind, to poison the due administration of justice, and a most barefaced insult to the authority of the Court. At the commencement of these proceedings, it was by your Lordships, most distinctly stated, that no publication of any of these proceedings was to take place, until the whole was completed; and on the following day your Lordships repeated that prohibition, in still stronger terms. Notwithstanding what was then said by the Court, a partial and garbled account of the proceedings has been issued from the public press: and calls, in my opinion, for the severest visitation of every Court of Justice, which does not mean to make itself a party to its own degradations. And the misfortune is, is that it is not a full statement, but a partial extract of a part of the proceedings, namely, the Attorney General's Speech; which is reported in such a manner, that the prisoners who now remain or trial, cannot, by any possibility, fairly take their trial; inasmuch as it is impossible that the Jury who are to try then can come unprejudiced into the box, after so garbled a statement. The paper I allude to, is the *Morning Chronicle*; that Paper I hold in my hand. It is the only Paper in my possession; though I am credibly informed that all the London Papers in some degree infringed the order of the Court.— Had this paper reported the whole of proceedings, I do not know, on the part of the prisoners, that my Learned Fried and myself would have objected; it is from a partial statement I think mischief is likely to arise. The pretence put forward for this contempt of the prohibition of the Court, makes it the less excusable. It is alledged by the publisher, that he is induced to make this publication in consequence of a vague publication having been made by another Journalist. Now, nothing can be more easy than to elude the order, and laugh at the authority of the Court, if such subterfuges are to be permitted. The *Morning Chronicle* complains that another Paper has published an imperfect account of the Attorney General's speech; and then it proceeds itself to give a more mischievous account, for the sake of correcting that which has been published:—and what makes this infinitely more dangerous is, that the paper which first published, and induced the publication of which I now complain, is under the known influence of Government.

Mr. Justice ABBOTT.—I don't know that. The Court can know nothing of any newspaper. They can know nothing of whether it is under that influence or under the influence of a private individual For myself, I can say truly, that I do not know the fact that has been stated, nor do I believe it.

Mr. DENMAN—I admit, my Lord, that I was wrong. The Court could not know any thing that did not appear before them upon affidavit. But what I complain of is, that it is set forward on one side as the pretence for publishing, that these prosecutions are brought forward for the purpose of supporting a party, and that Mr. Oliver is at the bottom of them; and the other argues that the Ministers are only taking active measures for repressing the disorders of the public peace and bringing the disturbers of the public peace to justice. These arguments are made the pretence for treating with contempt the order of your Lordship, and of violating that most wholesome proceeding which the Court had adopted in the outset of its business. I can only lay before your Lordships this imperfect account of the Attorney General's speech, which I do state is calculated to prejudice the cases of the remaining prisoners, whatever effect might have been produced by an impartial statement of the whole proceedings, and I leave it with your Lordships to do what you think proper.

The ATTORNEY GENERAL— I concur most entirely with my learned friend, Mr.Denman, in the justice of his complaint; and I can only say—

The LORD CHIEF BARON—Do you follow this with any motion?

Mr. DENMAN—All I can say is, that having made this complaint, I leave it to the Court to adopt such further proceeding as they think necessary to maintain its own authority. I thought it my duty to lay this complaint before your Lordships the very first opportunity that presented itself.

The CHIEF BARON.—If there is no motion, I don't see how the Court is to act.

Mr. DENMAN—Your Lordships will animadvert on the conduct of those who have infringed the order of the Court.

The LORD CHIEF BARON Who *are* those who have done so?

Mr. DENMAN—I thought it my duty to lay the matter before the Court,

The ATTORNEY GENERAL—I feel it to be duty to address a few words to your Lordship after what has been stated by my Learned Friend; but before I do so, I beg to intimate to your Lordship, that I man to follow my Learned Friend's example, in making no motion. What has been stated by Learned Friend, renders it incumbent on me, I think, (standing in the situation in which I do) to say a word or two to your Lordships upon this subject. Until within the last ten minutes, I had not seen any account of which has hitherto passed before this Court, or what purports to be an account of these proceedings. It does so happen that the Paper which my Learned Friend has alluded to, as calling for some expression of the displeasure of the Court, was put into my hand just before I came into Court, for the purpose of being brought under my notice. About ten minutes ago some person (I don't know who that person was) sent me one of the Newspapers which my Learned Friend alluded to—not the *Morning Chronicle*, but the *Courier*. That Paper I have seen, and I do lament, as much as my Learned Friend can possibly do, that any person should in any degree have violated the orders which your Lordships had promulgated on the first and second days of these proceedings; because it may tend to injure, though not prevent, the due administration of justice, by influencing, in some degree, the minds of the Jury. But I must beg leave to say, for myself, and for my Honourable and Learned Friends of Counsel for the Crown, (and I am quite sure I can say, — indeed I can undertake to say the same thing for every person who has any thing in the shape of an office under the Government) that we had no wish nor could we in any degree have wished that any thing should be stated to the public, of what passed here, until the whole can be stated fairly and properly. There is one phrase which my Learned Friend has used , which I could have wished had not escaped him, at which I confess I was much surprised, because it cannot but tend to prejudice the proceedings of the Court. My Learned Friend has talked of "Newspapers under the influence of Government." For myself I can only say, I know of no newspapers under the influence of Government— by whom employed or not employed. I know nothing of them, or of those by whom they are conducted. I know nothing of publications but as the sentiments of public writers upon public affairs. I know nothing of the paper alluded to by my Learned Friend, or of the persons by whom it is conducted. All I can say is, that whoever may the persons who conduct public newspapers on the one side or the other, who have violated the injunction of the Court, if they are brought, by proper affidavits, before your Lordship, distinctly proving them to have infringed your Lordship's order, I shall feel it to be my duty, without favour or partiality to the one side or the other, to submit such a motion as will put the authority of the Court in force; or if my Learned Friend can point out those who have violated the order of the Court, I shall cheerfully assist him now in bringing the parties within the power of your Lordships. I have not myself seen the paper which my Learned Friend has particularly named. I really know not of my own knowledge that the order has been infringed, but taking my Learned Friend's statement to be correct, I must concur with him in thinking, that the publication was extremely improper. If the order has been violated, I strongly protest against it, as highly improper and incorrect. My Learned Friend suggests, that one of the papers urges, as an excuse for its publication, that something like a professed account of the proceedings had been previously published another paper. I have not seen that professed account, but I can only say, that we have had no communication with the party making the publication, and that we are perfectly innocent of any thing in the shape of a publication; and, in fact, can have no desire to publish any part of these proceedings. No man can feel more, and no man can more strongly reprobate the conduct complained of; because the publication is extremely improper: even if it is correctly stated. It is very improper to publish the proceedings from time to time; because an impression may be made one way or the other; and such conduct tends, in my opinion, to obstruct the administration of justice. I have nothing more to say. I admit most fully with my Learned Friend, the impropriety of the conduct complained of; and I reprobate it as strongly as my friend can possibly do. I am extremely sorry it has been done, yet I am not disposed to believe that the infringement of the order arose from a desire to do that which is wrong. I do not impute to the editors of papers a motive of that sort— I have no doubt it arose from a desire to increase the sale of the newspapers which they conduct; but I do hope that, if Gentlemen are taking notes of the trials for publication, they will have the goodness to keep back those notes till the whole of the trials are finished. If, after this intimation, my Learned Friend will produce affidavits of any persons having again infringed the order, I shall feel it my duty to bring the conduct of such party under the notice of the Court.

`[TH: the above is very strange; like he planted the story and is denying it, but also explaining it and saying the original report (which he hadn't seen) as correct...]`

MR. DENMAN in reply—I fully acquit my Learned Friend, the Attorney General, and my other Learned Friend, of any intention, or any suspicion of having published, or having lent themselves to the publication of any part of the proceedings. All I can say is, that it will hardly be sufficient merely to promulgate an order; and I hope the Court will vindicate its privileges.

THE LORD CHIEF BARON— It is a very unfortunate and a very mischievous thing—mischievous in every mischievous to all sides. But all that we know of it is, that a newspaper is produced containing the account complained of. The Court cannot know who published these accounts, or who furnished the notes from which they were printed. These are matters of which we are entirely ignorant. The Attorney General has put the matter on its true grounds. If you cannot point out the parties, the Court cannot proceed.

Mr. Justice DALLAS—In the course of the proceedings on the trial of James Watson, at Westminster, a similar complaint was made against *The Observer* Sunday and Monday Newspaper. I recollect the circumstance perfectly well. A complaint was made against that Journal of having published part of the proceedings, notwithstanding the prohibition of the Court. Mr. Wetherell made that complaint, and my Lord Ellenborough said, "as you have announced that you do not mean to make any motion, the Court has nothing to do with hearing an address which is not to be followed by a motion. If you mean to move for an attachment, it must be founded upon affidavits. In conclusion, his Lordships says, "As there is no motion, it is not necessary to enter into it." Now, with respect to the complaint at present made, we have no fact whatever before us.— It is merely stated that a newspaper of a particular description has been published. That publication has drawn a production of another newspaper, but of this we know nothing. For myself I can say that I know nothing. A paper is produced, but by whom, or under what circumstances, is quite unknown to us. With respect to the allusion of one of these papers being under the influence of Government, I own I think it might have been spared, because it is an observation that may be of dangerous tendency; but of this I am persuaded, that the Government, or those who are appointed to conduct the affairs of Government, would be the first to bring to public justice those who improperly report the proceedings of Courts of Justice. At present there is no motion, or affidavit produced which can be the foundation of any motion. Therefore, pursuing the course adopted in the recent case, to which I have alluded, I think we ought to pass on to this trial.

THE KING V. WILLIAM TURNER.

Mr. Lowndes now proceeded in the usual form to intimate to the prisoner at the bar his right to challenge the Jury as they came to the book to be sworn; after which he called over the names of the Jurymen in the older in which they had been summoned. Two of the former Jury, who offered to serve again, were challenged for the prisoner, on whose behalf the following thirty-three were challenged.

Wm. White, of Inderidgehay, farmer.  
Robt. Beard, Dalbury, ditto  
Wm. Salt, ditto ditto

Thos. Hall, ditto, ditto  
Walthal Spurrier, ditto, ditto  
Robt. Wagstaff, ditto  
Wm. Bakewell, Sudbury, do.  
Thos. Hollis, ditto, ditto  
Luke Turner, ditto, ditto  
Henry Hall, Sutton, ditto  
Thus. Stratton, Tinsaley, do.

John Stretton, ditto, ditto  
Robert Steeple, ditto  
John Skevington, Yeaveley  
W. Berresford, Snelston, gent.  
Solomon Frost, ditto, farmer

The following Jury (of whom some were challenged for Brandreth) was at length sworn—

Thos. Ensor, Marston on Dove, farmer
Henry Spurrier, ditto, ditto.  
M. Goodall, Marston Montgomery, farmer  
Thomas Hall, Sutton, ditto.  
Sam. Dean, Ashleyhay, ditto.

J. Wagstaff, Atlave, ditto  
Jos. Wheeldon, Alvaston, do.  
James Osborne, ditto, ditto.  
T. Crumpton, Darley Abbey, gt.  
J, Glover, Findern, farmer.  
J[?]. Haslam, Lit. Chester, ditto.  
T. Ordish, Mickleover, ditto.

As in the former case, the indictment was read over to the Jury by the CLerk of Assize, as containing the charges upon which the prisoner was to take his trial.

Mr. BALGUAY, as Junior Counsel, then opened the case—After which the SOLICITOR GENERAL addressed the Jury, taking the same course adopted by the Attorney General in the former Trial. The Learned Gentleman spoke for one hour and a quarter.

Witnesses were then called, and examined by the Counsel for the Crown, in their turn, commencing with Mr. Sergeant Vaughan.

The witnesses called were— Anthony Martin, Shirley Asherry, Thomas Turner, Henry Tomlinson, Elijah Hall, sen. Elijah Hall, jun. Isaac Walker, Mary Epworth, Joseph Wilkinson, Samuel Fletcher, William Shipman, Henry Hole, Wm. Booth, and Wm. Storer.

After the examination of some other witnesses, the Court adjourned till eight o'clock to-morrow morning.

Many of the prisoners are of respectable connexions, and some of them have relations even in this town. It is a ,melancholy circumstance to relate, that the sister of one of them, named Hunt, a respectable milliner and dress-maker residing in Queen-street here, expired, last week, of a broken heart, occasioned by the horror which occupied her mind ever since she first learned that her unfortunate brother was one of the persons indicted for High Treason. This young man is of a respectable family, and spent a very considerable part of his life here previous to his apprehension. His unhappy sister was interred, on Saturday last, and her untimely and melancholy death is universally lamented.

BRANDRETH.

Brandreth was yesterday afternoon visited by the Chaplain of the gaol, to whose religious admonitions he was extremely attentive. His conduct since his conviction, as well indeed as before, has been decorous and correct. This morning, on the prisoners being brought down from their cells, several of them, among whom were Brandreth and the Ludlams, proceeded to perform their Religious duties, and remained in devout prayer for some time. These men, as well as the rest of their associates, have behaved, ever since their confinement with the utmost propriety; Brandreth has a wife and three children, and from a letter which he has written to his wife, it appears that she is now pregnant of a fourth. We have subjoined a copy of the letter in question, to the publication of,which the prisoner has said that he has no objection. All his desires now seem to be centered in the happiness and future prosperity of his family, for whose sake he has expressed a wish to raise a little sum of money. Persons who view, with proper sentiments, the crime of which the prisoner has been found guilty—but who, at the same time, regard the sentence which he is about to endure with the feelings of humanity, have contributed in a small degree to his desires, for which the wretched man has expressed himself most grateful.

The following is a literal copy of his letter, which as it shews the spirit of humility by which he is at present actuated, and can produce no mischief, but may have a different effect upon the minds of those who, like him, may have departed from the paths of Religion, we have no hesitation in giving it to our readers.

Derby Gaol, Oct. 18, 1817.  
My dearly beloved Wife,—At last I thought it my duty to write a few lines to you, which I am sure will affect you very much, to inform you of my dreadful situation; but I hope GOD be your friend—and if you will by Prayer appeal to God, you will undoubtedly find great consolation and relief for your distress, and as a husband and father let me entreat you that you will act a motherly part to the poor fatherless children, and bring them up in the fear of God, which is my most sincere desire, and likewise conduct yourself in an undeniable manner, as an example to the children to the love and fear of God, in the faith of JESUS CHRIST that you may never depart from that faith in Christ; and I wish for the convincing of all the souls in the house, that they may be at the arrival of this, and that we may all meet in Heaven, where trouble ceases and all is joy and glory! And I pray to GOD may this fatal stroke be joy to all that belong to me, instead of sorrow. Oh! that I may be the cause of their holy salvation —may it penetrate each wounded heart, so as to be their sole conversion to God. My dear, you may suppose my feelings are not easily to be described. At this time the Sentence is not passed, but I am found guilty by the Jury this day. My dear wife, it would give me great consolation if I could see you before I depart from this life; but my dear, if you are pregnant, I would have you advise with your poor distressed mother in law, whether it would be proper or not, and if she thinks it would not be of serious consequence, I should be very glad, but let it be well considered before you come to me, and if you do not come, let your father (if he thinks it would not be more than he can bear) as I know he is of a very timorous turn; but if he, neither, comes, I shall write again, it God permit me. —So my beloved wife, I hope you will excuse my short letter at this time. You may inform all friends that Goo gave me great fortitude to bear up my spirits on trial.—So I hope the bellings of God will be with you all, and most especially with you and our poor little babes.—So I conclude  
Your most affectionate Husband,  
JEREMIAH BRANDRETH.
For Ann Brandreth, Geo. Bridget's, Bedlam-court, Sutton in Ashfield.
