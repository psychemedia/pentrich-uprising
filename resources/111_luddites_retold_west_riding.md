THE LUDDITES IN THE WEST RIDING.

*By A. A. Watson, in "Country Words"*

Two generations have passed away from the face of the world since the attack was made upon Cartwright's Mill, Rawfolds, by the Luddites in 1812. Few men can remember with any degree accuracy the stirring times that were then made by discontented labouring men—goaded till poverty stared them hard in the face with its unwelcome visage. Commercial affairs were at nearly a dead lock, the price of provisions and clothing high, and the Peninsular war occupying care and attention—and perhaps demanding money that would have been better appropriated if spent In allaying the germs of discontent and the pangs of hunger at home, and, "Oh, were I King of France," would no doubt be a line suggestive to working, men of suitable words to meet their ideas at that time. Of course we cannot at the present day imagine such a state of commotion as then existed; great advances have been made since that time in the condition of the man who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow, and to us the followers of the imaginary Ned Lud command not much more sympathy than the Fenian of to-day. Grievances must not now be settled in such a Christian country as ours by recourse to the strength of arm. Duels have given place to actions at law; and if there are any sore spots in the condition of any class of men, they are all best remedied by an appeal to laws that grow less one-sided at every Parliamentary session. The Luddite riots were commenced at the latter end of the year 1811, at Nottingham, at the instigation (no doubt) of agitators, typified present by our Odgers and Bradlaughs, and made successful from the combined influences to which we have before referred; and the one event that lingers prominent in the popular memory is the attack made in April, 1812, on the premises of Mr. William Cartwright, at the little factory still standing on the road side at Rawfolds, between Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike. Yet, though so well known by tradition (if a story but sixty yearn old may be deemed traditionary) few who pass the adjoining turnpike will notice its insignificant form and shape, lost as it is in the forgetfulness occasioned by the nearness of massive new stone factories that overshadow it in bulk. The Luddites seem to have had a strong series of committees under the control of general committees, and a strong and detestable oath, added to a silent yet stern discipline [that] seems to have kept the men who were members in clutches from which, if they possessed the wish, they lacked the courage break. We give copy of the oath for the perusal of our readers:— "I, ————— of my voluntary will, do declare and solemnly swear that I never will reveal to any person or persons who compose the secret committees, their proceedings, meetings, places of abode, dress, features, connections, or anything else that might lead to a discovery of the same, either by word or deed, or sign, under the penalty of being sent out of the world by the first brother who shall meet me, and my name and character blotted out of existence, and never be remembered but with contempt and abhorrence; and I farther now do swear that I will use my best endeavour to punish by death any traitor or traitors, should any rise up amongst us, wherever I can find him or them; and though they should fly to the verge of nature, I will pursue them with unerasing vengeance. So help me God, to bless and help me to keep my oath inviolate." By midnight attacks in bodies, with disguised faces, and armed with every conceivable weapon, did these fanatics pursue their calling. The destruction of obnoxious machinery seemed to be their original intent; but not content with this programme, they destroyed goods that had either been made or finished with the aid of machinery. To these aims they added the stealing of arms and money. Burglaries were committed by wholesale in the villages throughout the West Riding that were near to the great towns, and anything portable in the shape of gold and silver went to increase their spoils. The members were armed with the knives, pistols, or muskets stolen in these midnight rambles, and drilled in companies on the outskirts of their villages at the dead of night. In these depredations they were classed into sections, distinguished by the arm they bore; and it seems that in some of their attacks that even sections of unarmed men were amongst some of the bodies. In March, 1812, at Rawden, parties attacked factories and destroyed the machinery and goods. On the 8th April following, a body of three hundred did similar mischief at Wakefield, as before described, with the addition of front and rear guards of mounted men carrying drawn sabres. Soon after, the Sheffield Militia Armoury was broken into and gutted, and factories at last were demolished and set on fire in all the great centres of the woollen trade. Intimidation was prevalent; the military had to keep constantly ready for calls to arms, and the crowds of rioters had to be dispersed by them daily. Not content with all this commotion, the leaders then impressed upon their dupes that nothing would be decisive till the masters were shot. A Mr Horsfall, of Marsden, was the first they attempted to shoot, and the only person who met his death at their hands. A young woman at Leeds was nearly beaten to death because she had accidentally become acquainted with information that might be used against them. A constable and a magistrate's lives were attempted, as well as the life of General Campbell. All these things happened in the month of April, 1812; and, perhaps, were it not for the prompt measures taken by a Mr Joseph Radcliffe, of Milnsbridge (afterwards for his bravery made a baronet), who formed bodies of special constables, and in other ways gave auxiliary and valuable help to the authorities—as well as the determined resistance made by Mr Cartwright,—things would not have then been so readily settled. On the 11th of April, at one o'clock, one hundred men from the Huddersfield district marched over to Rawfolds at dead of night, armed with various weapons and firearms, and for nearly half an hour endeavoured to break in the doors of Mr Cartwright's factory, demolishing the windows, but at last foiled in their attempts, leaving two wounded men, a quantity of weapons, and other things about the place. The facts of the case seem to have been as follows:—Mr Cartwright had several machines used in the finishing processes of the woollen trade that were obnoxious to the Luddites, and he had for some time expected a nocturnal visit from the secret society. He therefore prepared himself for protecting his property by taking beds into his mill and offices, and accommodating his men there at nights. All were possessed of arms. On the night of the attack ten men were in the mill, half of them soldiers. The howl of the dog was their first alarm; and so well did they protect themselves and their property that they drove away the band of men ten times their number in the time above stated. For this bravery, Mr Cartwright received a gift of £3,000 from the neighbouring gentry. A week after the attack on the mill he was shot at on the road by an unseen man. It was only ten days after this that Mr Horsfall was killed, and then justice, with its slow yet certain claws, seized on their gang, broke up their secret tribunals; and in the January of the following year (1813), sixty-six of the leaders were convicted at a special commission held at York, presided over by Baron Thompson and Sir Simon le Blanc. Seventeen of them were capitally convicted, and paid the penalty with their lives; of the remained, some were sentenced to penal servitude, and the rest were discharged upon their own recognisance to appear for judgment when called upon.
