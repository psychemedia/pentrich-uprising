"A Green Bag Maker."—What was the origin of the term "a Green Bag Maker"? In 1817 a political spy named Oliver was so termed by Mr. Baines, of Leeds: " What the trade of this man may be we cannot pretend to say—but that he is a Green Bag Maker by profession is, we think, sufficiently obvious." St. Swithin.

"A Green Bag Maker" (8 S. ix. 468).— See a full explanation in 'N. & Q.,' 2nd S. xi. 150; 6th S. iv. 71. After the trial of Queen Caroline, 1820, the phrase "Green Bag" became common, and frequently occurs in contemporary ephemeral literature :—
"The Queen Triumphant ; or, the Glorious Triumph of Truth and Innocence over Falsehood and Corruption ! ! with an observation or two on the Dying Groans and Expiring Agony of the Green Bag...... a sermon preached at Ebenezer Chapel, Dagger-lane, Hull,...... November 26th, 1820, Dedicated to Her Majesty, by Samuel Lane."
W. C. B.

Obviously this expression must have been a Whig term of opprobrium, arising from the notorious "Green-Bag" affair, so well known in relation to the trial of Queen Caroline. The Green Bag was produced by Lord Sidmouth in February, 1817. See Haydn’s ' Dates.'

"The Green Bag." — What were the contents of the article known as " The Green Bag?" Did it contain the papers of the "delicate investigation" on the conduct of the Princess of Wales in 1806, or the seditious papers presented by Lord Sidmouth to Parliament in 1817 (see Haydn's *Dictionary of Dates*), or those on Queen Caroline's trial (see Martineau's *History of England*, vol. i. p. 253.) ? or were these severally in green bags, and the term applied equally to each series of papers? 2nd. Is a green bag the usual cover to documents sent from the offices of ministers of state to parliament, as distinguished from the blue bag of the law? 3rd. Or has the term " green bag " a conventional meaning, as applied to investigations of a delicate, or I may say indelicate, nature, such as the Spaniard calls *Poco Verde* ? Verpant GREEN.

6th S. IV.

"The Green Bag " (2nd S. xi. 150).—It is now about twenty years ago that a question was sent to "N. & Q." as to the contents of "the green bag," so well known in connexion with Queen Caroline's trial,——whether such contents were the delicate disclosures of Lady Douglas in 1806, and, secondly, whether there was anything of official custom as to a particular sort of bag being used for important papers. The question has never been answered, and as no one searching the index volumes of "N. & Q." for information should find a query with no reply, I venture to trouble you with an answer to the first part of the question.

No; the green bag did not contain the accusations of 1806. These were published in *The Book* in 1813. The green bags (for there were two) contained all the evidence that had been obtained by "the Milan Commission" with regard to the princess's conduct with one Bartolomeo Bergami, whom she had engaged as a courier originally at Milan, but whom she converted into a favourite, placing him at the head of her household, and purchasing for him foreign titles and decorations.

After the publication of *The Book* (1813) the princess left England in 1814, going first to Brunswick, then in the middle of October to Milan ; in 1815 she went to Naples, and afterwards to Savona, near Tunis, to Ephesus and Jerusalem. In 1817 she went to Carlsruhe and Vienna, and in July of the same year to Rome. She remained abroad during 1818-19; but on the accession to the throne of George IV. she was advised, and determined, to come over and claim her position as queen consort. As soon as her immediate arrival was announced, on Tuesday, June 6, 1820, the king sent messages to both Houses of Parliament. Lord Liverpool delivered the one to the Lords, Lord Castlereagh that to the Commons, and each at the same time laid on the table a green bag, containing papers for their consideration. In each house a secret committee was appointed to examine the contents of "the green bag" and report to the House. After some delay the committee in the Lords pursued their investigation, and on July 4 Lord Harrowby, Chairman of the Secret Committee, presented the report, which stated that "a number of persons of various stations of life and residing in different parts of Europe" had recorded facts " which deeply affect the honour of the queen."

On this Lord Liverpool brought in a "Bill of Pains and Penalties," `[TH: full title was "Bill of Pains and Penalties for an Act to deprive Caroline of the rights and title Queen Consort and to dissolve her marriage to George"]` and the second reading of this Bill was really "the trial of Queen Caroline." It was fixed for August 17, and the case ended on Nov. 6, when there was a majority of twenty-eight for the second reading. Such evidence, however, as that of Teodoro Majocchi, who on cross-examination had one stereotyped answer, "Non mi ricordo," and of Giuseppe Restelli and others, who were evidently perjured and had been suborned, Restelli himself having been sent out of England,—these things, with the powerful defence of Brougham, and a strong feeling amongst many in favour of a woman whom they believed to have been badly treated, reduced the majority on the third reading from twenty-eight to nine; and Lord Liverpool would not submit the Bill of Pains to the Commons, but withdrew it.

The contents of the green bag may be seen by any one who will take down the Annual Register for 1820. The whole trial is given in vol. lxii. part ii. There was a necessity for a second volume that year, in consequence of the mass of matter occasioned not only by this lengthy trial, but by the death of George III., accession of George IV., and the death and funeral of the Duke of Kent, of whom there is a pleasing memoir. With easy access, as we see, to the whole contents of the green bag, one asks oneself why a question should be raised on the matter. May not the answer to this be, that it is not generally known that there were duplicate bags, and that the one in the Commons was never opened? A secret committee was appointed, and there were some—Sir F. Burdett and others—who urged the examination of its contents. Mr. Wilberforce brought on a motion for " abandoning the inquiry," and in the debate that followed several references were made to "the bag." But Lord Castlereagh, seeing that the temper of the Houses was not the same, and that if they disagreed on a course of action the position would become difficult, delayed and prevented the opening of the papers he had laid on the table.

For anything I know to the contrary, the green bag sent to the "faithful Commons" may still lie, sealed and unexamined, in the archives of Westminster; if this be the case, it should be added to Madame Tussaud's collection in her " Chamber of Horrors." Gibbes Ricaud.
