THE TRIALS FOR TREASON

On Saturday, the *Morning Chronicle* asserted that our Letters from Derby were designed, not merely to "prejudge" the case of the prisoners, "but to inflame the public mind against them." This is a charge which may be made against the publication of any account of the crimes with which they are accused. At this rate, nothing should ever appear respecting any accused person, until his trial is concluded. Yet all the papers are daily filled with Police Reports in the face of this rule. Why publish examinations before Magistrates; why publish bills of indictment before trial? It is particularly complained, that on Thursday, our Derby Letter began thus, "the town is all bustle and confusion, arising from the commencement of the Quarter Sessions, and the arrival of the period appointed for the trial of those unfortunate men, who by a series of the most wanton and outrageous acts, on the 9th of June last, threw this and the adjoining county into a state the utmost terror and alarm." It is also complained, that we said places of religious worship had been chosen for the assemblage of the seditious, though that fact was affirmed to the sermon preached before the Judges previous to the Court's opening. And what crime is there in saying, the men going on trial are those who committed the excesses on the 9th of June? Does not the bill of indictment say they [*sic*] same? Have not all the Newspaper details, reports and rumours said the same? Has not the same been said a hundred times over by every Newspaper in England? The very fact of sending the men to trial authorises the assertion. Is there a man in England who, on such a fact, or on such an assertion, would doom the men to death? No, certainly. That can only be done by a Jury, after a minute and impartial investigation of the evidence on both sides.— The Magistracy decide, in the first instance, such charges to be sufficient to send such men to trial. After this, how can newspapers speak of them but as the men so accused?

While we are censured for speaking of these men in similar terms to those which all other newspapers have used respecting them, let see how the complaining *Morning Chronicle* has been basely endeavouring to defeat the justice of its country, by assertions of their innocence, by insinuations that they were instigated by Oliver, &c. in publications timed to have an effect at the moment of trial.

*From the Morning Chronicle of Tuesday, October the 14th—Extract of a letter in the most conspicuous part of the Paper, signed Fitzwilliam:—*

THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL.
October 10, 1817.

My Lord— To those who have carefully perused the indictment of the forty-eight men who are to be tried for High Treason on the 15th of this month, at Derby, it must be matter of some surprise that Ministers, after the issues of their late political adventures in the Courts of Justice, should once more endeavour, on similar grounds, to make out a case of high treason against the whole people of Great Britain, as a justification of having deprived them of the benefit of the Constitution and the protection of the law.

That the aforesaid forty-eight men may have committed an atrocious riot, that acts of violence and robbery may have been among the consequences, and that even murder may have been committed, is all very possible—although I see not a word in the indictment respecting a foul murder said, on very good authority, to have been committed; while it repeatedly set forth, that the rioters came forth "with intent to attack, fight with, kill and destroy the soldiers, troops and forces of our Lord the King;" in order "to subvert and destroy the Government and Constitution."

Now, my Lord, recollecting that "our Lord the King" has an army of one hundred and forty-nine thousand veterans, commanded by officers of the highest gallantry and greatest skill, we naturally inquire, who are these forty-eight men, what their connections, and what the means in possession or prospect whereby they were to carry into execution the enterprise stated in the Indictment? and that document describes them as follows, namely, one tailor—one blacksmith—one farmer—one stonegetter—two stone-masons—and forty-one labourers !—It is true that we are there told five hundred and upwards joined in the tumult. But does not our common sense revolt at seeing such a tumultuary proceeding a scheme for subverting the Government?

Why, my Lord, are not these men tried for their real and visible crimes, if, as reported, of much atrocity? Is not the law in our too-well-known criminal code sufficiently strong to punish them? But why, through the sides of these forty-eight rioters, is an attempt to be made to justify the punishment which, on mere green bag imputations, has actually been and continues to be inflicted on the whole people of Great Britain by the functionaries who administer the Government?

Suppose, my Lord, that by inference piled on inference, interpretation tacked to interpretation, construction coupled with construction, a plain Derbyshire Jury should b so puzzled and confounded by the metaphysical distinctions and law fictions the ten or twelve learned Barristers who it is said are retained by the Crown against the prisoners, as to be unable to distinguish what is from what is not a treason, explained as to be incomprehensible, and should such Jury be thereby moved and induced by the instigation of so many gentlemen of the long robe to find a verdict of guilty, your Lordship will recollect that another verdict will remain to be given before the nation will be satisfied——namely, the verdict of dispassionate reason at the bar of the public.

As person convicted of high treason is not only to suffer an ignominious, but a cruel death; so a proof of that uncommon crime ought not to depend on slippery inferences and suppositions, but to be so plain and palpable that no man of sense could doubt it. A proof by construction hanging on construction, savours too much of the ludicrous reasonings of the adepts of derivation.

In the way of ridicule, your Lordship may have heard "Pickled cucumber" thus derived from Jeremiah King."—"Jeremiah King"——"Jerry King" —"Jerkin"—Girking"—" Pickled Cucumber." Let us hope that nothing so ridiculous will be played off at Derby, for deriving high treason from a licentious tumult of a misguided, stupid rabble!

Touching that part of the indictment, my Lord, which accounts for the depravity of  mind—the seat of intention, which constitutes crime,—it is said that the tailor and his companions were "moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil" to do as they did. This I take to be a fact; because I have been credibly informed, that a Devil in human shape was particularly active in the work of seduction and instigation.

*From the Morning Chronicle of Wednesday, last.*  
Derby.—Tuesday Morning.  
The Law Officers are understood to have determined on making a selection of those against whom the evidence is most conclusive.

To this legal novelty, however, it is probable that *considerable opposition* will be given by the Counsel for the accused, as they are stated to be of opinion the *acts of the individuals* thus distinguished, will be likely to receive a *colouring*, which would not attach to them, viewed in connection with all the proceedings of those with whom they have been concerned. Many of the prisoners are very young, and in the *lowest* situations of life. The whole of them, or nearly the whole of them, are spoken of as being *extremely illiterate*. Brandreth, the person accused of the murder, has latterly deported himself in a strange way. Among other eccentricities, he has for considerable time suffered his beard to grow, and persists in *refusing to be shaved*. *The name of Oliver does not appear among the witnesses.*

So industrious have the Officers of the Crown been to conduct this *extraordinary* prosecution to an issue *more flattering to their judgment*, than that which belonged to the trial of Dr. Watson, that in addition to the most eminent advocates in the country, all the barristers of rank and talent on this circuit have been retained for the Crown, with the exception only of Mr. Denman. Mr. Lockitt it Solicitor for the Crown: but there is a circumstance connected with this Gentleman which has given rise to a great deal animadversion here, and which will, no doubt, excite general astonishment. Mr. Lockitt was the active ostensible Under Sheriff for the county, from the time that Capt. Hallowes, the present Sheriff, was sworn in, until very lately, when a Mr. Simpson, of this town, was announced as the Under Sheriff. It is known that, according to law , an Under Sheriff cannot act as law agent for any party, and this provision is obviously meant to prevent the influence which belongs to such an officer, from interfering with the due administration of justice. Mr. Simpson is intimately connected with Mr. Lockitt. I give this statement, as it has been communicated to me upon good authority.

*Independent* and *intelligent* men here speak of this *extraordinary* trial just in the *same strain* as the prosecution of *Watson and Co.* was spoken of in London. But Watson and Co. were highly intellectual and important, indeed, compared to the *miserable beings* who are here accused of compassing the death of the King and the overthrow of the Constitution.

*From the Morning Chronicle of Thursday last.*  
Derby, Oct. 15.  
I have reason to believe, the more correct opinion is, that the first trial will comprehend six of the prisoners, who are said to have been implicated in the commission of murder. That murder was perpetrated the day on which the indictment alleges the insurrection to have taken place, no doubt is entertained: yet that crime has not been recited among the overt acts set forth in the indictment; but it is apprehended that the evidence by which it will be established may have material influence upon the fate of the accused. Why, however, we may ask, should the proof of murder produce a conviction for high treason?

The first trial will, it is expected, occupy five or six days, and it is said that the publication of any of the proceedings will be interdicted until the whole of the trials shall have terminated, if indeed more than one trial take place. For if acquittal should be the result of the first trial, it is concluded that, as in Watson's case, the prosecution will cease, while, if conviction should take place, it is rumoured that the Crown will not seek for any more victims,

Among intelligent observers, the whole of the disturbance which gave rise to these prosecutions is attributed to the artifice and activity of the noted Oliver. He is understood to have been acquainted with several of the prisoners, but especially with one of the name Bacon, who is quite an enthusiast, somewhat resembling the character of Preston. Several anecdotes of a curious nature are told of Oliver in this district. He called upon a Mr. Robertshaw, (the keeper of a respectable tavern in Derby), last Whitsunday, to whom he introduced himself with great confidence and familiarity as an ardent reformer, connected with some of the most popular advocates for reform in London. He inquired about the number of the population of Derby, and dwelt upon the force which it was capable of employing to make the voice of the people heard and attended to. Nothing, he said, but force, could make the people be heard by such Ministers as governed the country; and that it was shameful in the people to be silent, and especially inconsistent on the part of the Members of the Hampden Club to lie dormant on such an occasion, when their friends in London were so anxious for their assistance and co-operation.

*From the Morning Chronicle of Friday last.*  
Derby—Wednesday Night.  
It is not yet understood what course the Attorney-General proposes to pursue, whether to try only one prisoner or several in the first instance. If the former, it is supposed that Thomas Bacon will be the man, as he is the first named the indictment; and also, as in a printed paper circulated here, it is said from the Crown Solicitor's Office, the proceedings are denominated "An indictment against Thomas bacon and others for high treason." This Bacon is the person with whom, as I mentioned yesterday, Oliver had frequent communications. Bacon was Chairman of what was called Hampden Club Ripley, in this county.

A SUBJECT EXTRAORDINARY FOR DISSECTION

A Subject Extraordinary for Dissection.—

A singular circumstance occurred at Mr. Brooks's, Surgeon, in Blenheim-street, Oxford-street, at seven o'clock last night. At that hour a coach drew up to the door, where subjects for dissection are received, and a body a sack was deposited on the top of the stairs leading to the dissection room. The coachman and assistants made their bow as usual upon such occasions, and left the subject. Mr. Brooks happened to be present, and asked one of his men why he did not tumble the body down stairs? The man in compliance with his master's mandate began to perform his work, taking hold of the end of the sack, and having got it down two steps, a living subject threw his naked arms and shoulders out, and begged for his life, not relishing being tumbled down about twenty stone steps. A scene of confusion followed, easier conceived than described. Mr. Brooks stood over the subject with a brace of loaded pistols, whilst his attendants flew for an officer. Prompt assistance, was had, and the fellow, in a complete state of nudity, was imploring mercy with the engines of destruction at his head, when that assistance arrived. The account he gave of himself was, that he had come from Teddington that day, that he had got so drunk he did not know how he came there. He said he had no recollection of the person or persons who brought him there, or where he had been. Mr. Brooks observed, that men run for wagers in sacks, and at his suggestion the sack was tied round his chin, and a hole being cut through the bottom for his feet, he was conveyed away by Needham, constable, to the watch-house in a coach.

London Courier and Evening Gazette - Tuesday 21 October 1817

[TH Courier response ]

William Turner, accused of High Treason, and one of the persons included in the indictment of forty-eight for rebellion in Derbyshire, was yesterday put upon his trial at Derby, before another Jury, and the trial was expected to be concluded this day.

Previously to the commencement of the trial, Mr. Denman, Counsel for the Prisoners, instructed by the agents of traitors, no doubt, complained to the Court that the *Courier* had violated its prohibition, by publishing garbled accounts of the proceedings. Mr. Denman followed his instructions, which informed him, partially and falsely, if the report in the *Times* of this day, which we think it more fair to quote than our own, be correct. He says "the other Papers copied the garbled account of the Attorney General's speech expressly from the *Courier* of last evening, the *Morning Chronicle* adding what the *Courier* omitted." The *Courier* expressly said, that the statement it gave of the Insurrection, was not an account of the Attorney-General's speech, garbled or ungarbled, but a statement to inform the public generally of the nature the offence under trial. Mr. Denman could not have read the Courier, or he would not have made such misrepresentation; he must have spoken merely from the instructions of the agents of traitors. This statement which we gave, the *Morning Chronicle* next day chose, for it's own purposes, to consider as a garbled account the Attorney-General's speech, and under that pretence published a report of that speech. Circumstances, however, shew how well it knew it was acting under pretences and falsehood, how fearful it was of its own conscious guilt and the punishment of the Court. It raised a clamour against what it called the demi-official Journal of Government, a description of which are proud, whether just or not; as violating the injunctions of the Court, and while it blamed, it followed what it censured as our evil course. That was not enough. It did not feel easy in acting on a pretence evidently so shallow. It must have further protection. Therefore, it prevailed on another Morning Paper, which generally supports the Government, to commit the same offence it did, under precisely the same word of apology. They published the same *verbatim*, these two Papers which scold each other on politics nearly as much as any other two do. "Now," said the *Chronicle*, "I can not only set up a pretended precedent from the *Courier*, but I share my guilt with another Government Journal; I am shielded on both sides." This was not all. We were also accused of giving garbled accounts of the evidence, though we merely published a list of witnesses as they were examined, carefully omitting any application to the prisoners of any thing they said, and in fact giving nothing of what they did say. If, then, we published a garbled account of the Attorney General's speech, and a garbled account of the evidence; why did not the *Chronicle* publish a correct account of the evidence, to correct our garbled report in the one case as well as the other? It was by far the necessary duty of the two. But they dared not go quite so far. That would have been to have violated the injunctions of the Court, not only in letter and in form, but in spirit, in the most essential point. In fact, it was the report of the Attorney General's speech in the *Chronicle*, that was yesterday the real ground of complaint, though the agents of traitors' contrived to make it appear as the report of the *Courier*, else how could the Attorney-General, in alluding to the report complained of, say; "There is here a professed account of what was stated by me."—No such "professed"  account appeared in the *Courier*. It was the *Chronicle* that the "professed" account appeared. Had the Counsel and the Judges read the *Chronicle* and the *Courier* during the three last days of last week, they would have understood the subject precisely as we state it. But the complaint was made at the instance of the agents of traitors, the opposite side was not warned or prepared to answer it, and the agents of traitors were thus enabled to make the affair go before the world just with such sort of colouring as they chose to give it. And after all:— the publication of the Attorney-General's speech was not a mischievous infraction of the orders of the Court, though a very distinct breach of them. One of the journalists, who was the first to clamour against us; when we answered by referring to the publication of the Bill of Indictment, replied, that was an official document, its phraseology merely technical, all its details and assertions of guilt, all its inflammatory language passed for nothing with the public, it being notoriously a highly coloured *ex-parte* statement. And, pray, what is the speech of the Attorney-General, or of the opening Counsel in any case, but highly charged, partial representation, which passes for nothing until it is proved to be true by the evidence, and the charge from the Judge? The *Chronicle* should thank us for helping it out of the scrape into which it has fallen.

Indeed, this act of service we the more readily perform, as we know the clamour the *Chronicle* raises is not in a spirit of hostility to the *Courier*, but with the hope of calumniating the Government, by representing that the *Courier* acts wholly under the direction of Ministers. Yesterday we stated, and we again affirm, that no one communication, written or verbal, has been received from any person connected with Government, on the subject of the matter that has appeared in this Paper respecting these trials. We ourselves have gone to great expence, to procure the earliest accounts of them, and we have just as much reason to lament the prohibition of the Court some of the other Journalists, who whine and whimper, and pout, every morning, over their fruitless speculation, of establishing expresses the road for "the REGENT" and for "Lord Sidmouth." Every one and every thing hostile to the Government is espoused by the *Chronicle* as a matter of course. Black spirits and white, blue spirits and grey; mingle, mingle, mingle; all you that mingle may.— To please the Opposition in Parliament, it would have traitors escape that no grounds may be made for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus; to please the low detestable faction of assassins who call themselves reformers, to please those "divers other traitors unknown", it would have traitors escape that rebellion may prosper; and hence, in no spirit of ill will to the *Courier*, but purely to calumniate Government and encourage treason, it attacks Ministers as the Editors and Conductors of this Paper. The charge is very agreeable to us, very flattering. Not so, we fear, to the Ministers, who, if the *Chronicle* speaks truly every day, of the horrible embarrassment into which they have involved all our public affairs, have quite enough to with the business of their own Offices, without writing paragraphs for the *Courier*.

The above observations have been written upon the report in the *Times* this morning of the proceedings yesterday at Derby, previously to the perusal of the account in the *Courier* this day, as we wished to avoid being influenced by the representations of our own reporter. A perusal of our own report, since writing the above, however, strongly confirms us in the review we taken. Had we previously known of the proceedings in Court yesterday, we would not this day have copied from the *Times* an account of the Attorney General's opening speech on *Brandreth*'s trial; but that part of our Paper was printed before our Express from Derby arrived.

London Courier and Evening Gazette - Wednesday 22 October 1817

It will seen by the account of the proceedings at Derby, that another of the individuals (*Wm. Turner*) charged with High Treason, has been found Guilty.— To excite pity for a convicted traitor, some of the journals still insinuate that the Jury were influenced by accounts in this Paper of the proceedings on the trial, as if they, who had witnessed the whole, whom every passing was addressed, should not know more than what are called "garbled extracts" could inform them! The trial began on Thursday; nothing respecting the proceedings on it could appear in this Paper till Friday, and on Saturday, three or four hours before the Friday's Papers could arrive, the Jury had given their verdict. The London mail reaches Derby at two o'clock, and the Jury had pronounced their decision before twelve.

The *Morning Chronicle* boasts of having ever supported the cause of humanity. Humanity! Is it humanity to advocate the cause assassins and traitors, endeavouring spread fire and desolation over the land? Two days before *Brandreth*'s' trial, it argued his case over in a letter, signed and pronounced him innocent: it contended he was a dupe of Oliver's artifices, he, this *Brandreth*, who appears to be one the most atrocious ruffians of the assassinating gang of Reformers. This was the *Chronicle*'s "humanity." It would have let loose upon us a sanguinary ruffian, a murderer. To-day it says— "Justice requires that Jurors should not be prejudiced who are to sit on the trial of their fellow-creatures;" and it obeys its own maxim by shewing to the Jury going try a man, that the man is innocent!—that he was only the dupe of OLIVER, though Oliver's name was never mentioned on the trial." All this canting and clamour, and misrepresentation, is designed, no doubt, to answer the same purpose as Fitzwilliam's Letter, to prejudge the innocence of the men yet to be tried.
