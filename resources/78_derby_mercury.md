HOUSE OF LORDS, Tuesday, June 8.

A Commission was brought down from the Prince Regent expressive of his approbation of the choice the Commons had made of Mr. Manners Sutton as their Speaker.

LORD COLCHESTER.

The Earl of LIVERPOOL presented a Message from the Prince Regent, stating the eminent services of the Right Honourable Charles Abbot, as Speaker for several years of the House of Commons, and his having been in consequence advanced by the Prince Regent to the dignity of Baron Colchester, of Colchester, in Essex, and desiring the concurrence of their Lordships in making a provision for Lord Colchester, and for the next male heir of his body succeeding to the title.

Ordered to be taken into consideration on Thursday; the Lords to be summoned.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRINCE REGENT.

Lord SIDMOUTH brought down a Message from the Prince Regent, which stated, that His Royal Highness had ordered to be laid before the House Papers containing information of practices, meetings, and combinations carried on in different parts of the kingdom, tending to disturb the public peace and tranquillity, and to endanger the Constitution of these realms, and recommending the House to take the same into its immediate consideration.

The Message having been read,

Lord SIDMOUTH said, pailnful as it must be to make the communication just read, it was imperiously called for, with a view to secure the public peace, and the tranquillity of the State. What steps are to be taken, would be for the House to determine. The first step would be to address the Prince Regent, and then to examine the Papers, referring the Papers to a Committee of Secrecy, to be composed of the same Members, with the exception of a Noble Duke, who desired not to be upon that Committee. With respect to the information, he should suppose no objection would be made to refer the Papers to the Committee. If they should be referred, then would be the time to examine and determine upon what measures it would be necessary to adopt for the purpose named in the Message. The Noble Lord then moved an Address of Thanks to the Prince Regent &c.

Earl GREY, had no objection to a mere Vote of Thanks, but did not pledge himself to any ulterior object founded on the Message.

The Address was then carried.

Lord SIDMOUTH then moved, that a Committee of Secrecy be appointed to examine the Papers, which was agreed to, after a few observations from the opposition side of the House, and the following Noblemen named: the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President, Lord Liverpool, Lord Sidmouth, Duke of Montrose, Earl Talbot, Earl Fitzwilliam, Earl of St. Germains, Earl Powis, Lord Grenville, and Lord Redesdale.

HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION ACT.

Lord HOLLAND rose to bring forward his motion respecting the Correspondence which had passed between the Secretary of State and the visiting Magistrates of Berkshire, on the subject of the Circular Letter of the Noble Viscount: one of the opinions was strictly illegal. The Noble Lord went over the whole of the questions, and the answers given by the Noble Secretary; there was a harsh spirit which dictated these answers, he observed, as referable to many of the questions. The Act of the 31st of the King, giving power to the visiting Magistrates to visit the prisons, no exception being made in he case of any prisoner. Now the fact was, that two Magistrates applied to visit the prison, and were refused permission, the orders of the Secretary of State to the contrary being shewn to them. This conduct, the Noble Lord contended, was an usurpation of the Bill of Rights, and certainly an infringement of the statute law of the land, and of the Constitution, and exercising an authority which belonged alone to the Legislature. He concluded with moving for the production of the Correspondence referred to.

Lord SIDMOUTH assured the House that in the execution of an arduous office he had always endeavored to do his duty, but if his conduct was liable to comment, he desired not to shrink from any responsibility. He had always understood that the gaols of the kingdom were subject to the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. With respect to the 31st of the King, if the Royal Prerogative was to be excepted, a special enactment ought to have been introduced for that purpose. In the time of Lords Holt and Raymond, the permission for a wife to see her husband (committed for High Treason,) was denied. Similar refusals had been given in other cases of state prisoners. Without arrogating to himself any more humanity than his predecessors, he might say, that he had on some occasions, exercised a degree of discretion favourable to the prisoners; and contended that in no instance had he departed from precedent, nor had he exercised any extraordinary degree of harshness, such as was imputed to him by the Noble Lord. If the House intended to throw blame upon him, they could agree to the motion. As far as his own vote went, he certainly should object to it.

Earl GREY supported the motion, contending that it was harsh to deny prisoners the use of paper or books.

The Earl of LIVERPOOL opposed the motion, on the grounds stated by his Noble Friend.

The Earl of ROSSLYN supported the motion.

The Lord CHANCELLOR and the Earl of LIVERPOOL objected to the motion, which was negatived without a division.

HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION.

Friday.— Lord HOLLAND presented the Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of London against the continuance of the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus, which was read and ordered to lie on the table.

Lord HOLLAND said, he hoped and trusted this Petition would be followed up by others, until the general expression of public opinion compelled the Ministers of the Crown to abandon the system they were now pursuing, which was so highly detrimental to the interests of the country.

THE LATE INSURRECTION

In our last publication, we discharged a most painful duty, and announced the appearance of an alarming insurrection, extending along the northeastwardly, or Nottinghamshire side of this county, But we abstained from any attempt to give a detailed account of what had happened, not because we were insensible of the deep interest which this event had excited, or were unwilling either to relieve the anxiety, or gratify the curiosity of the public, but solely from a consideration of our duty.

The magistrates had but just entered upon the investigation of the business,-With obvious propriety, they were conducting the examination of the witnesses in private,— Nothing authentic had transpired.- We neither wished, on the one hand, to encrease the existing alarm, by giving our sanction to the various reports which were in circulation, and create a prejudice against those unfortunate men, who had been made prisoners; nor, on the other, to under-rate the danger from which we have been providentially rescued by the incessant vigilance of the Government, the active exertions of our Magistrates, and the zealous Co operation of the Military.

It is almost unnecessary for us to advert, to the unceasing exertions, which have been made for several years, to excite a spirit of discontent, and sedition, in the lower classes of the people throughout the kingdom, The success of these exertions, aided as they have been by the speeches of men of high rank in society, both in, and out of parliament, by the most gross abuse of the liberty of the press, and by that distress which has of late pervaded the nation, and which the manufacturing, and labouring poor have been taught to believe has been brought upon them, by a corrupt and wicked government, has been long visible in a neighbouring county, and we grieve to acknowledge, that at length it is become apparent in this. To these causes we refer all the mischief which has arisen, and has been contemplated.

It is well known, that toward the latter end of the last, and in the beginning of the present year, political Clubs were formed, upon the recommendation of a meeting, held in London about twelve months ago, throughout the midland, and northern districts under the title of *Hampden Clubs*, and for the ostensible purpose of obtaining a reform in Parliament. We are far from condemning political associations having a lawful object, and pursuing that object by lawful, and constitutional means; nor can we censure indiscriminately all the members of these particular institutions, altho' we are aware that the most alarming mischief has arisen from them. There are many honest, and we might add loyal men who have been members of these clubs; but we are forced by discoveries, and events, to declare our opinion, that such men have been duped, and have unconsciously given their sanction to projects of the most desperate, and horrid nature. We do not presume to define the character of the late insurrection; it may be treason, it may be sedition;-this must be admitted at all events that it was of a most dangerous tendency,-and there can be no doubt but that it is the overt act of a conspiracy, extending throughout the manufacturing and populous parts of the midland and northern counties; formed and unhappily brought into action in this County, by *delegates* from the *Hampden Societies*.

It appears that two or three previous days, and at length that Monday the 9th instant, was fixed for a general insurrection in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire, and that immense bodies of men, armed with guns, pikes, and other offensive weapons, were to have marched out of Lancashire, and Yorkshire, over the northeastwardly side of this county, and the westwardly side of Nottinghamshire, into the town of Nottingham. They were to have forced into their service every person found on their march, and capable of affording them any assistance, and to have provided further supplies of arms, particularly guns, which they were most in want of, by taking them out of private houses, and depots of military stores. It seems that they were to have remained at Nottingham and to have established a provisional Government there until they heard of the success of similar operations in other parts of the kingdom, and a convention was then to be held for the formation of a constitution, according to their own notions of civil, and religious liberty.

Under this delusion, a party of about fifty or sixty men from the village, and neighbourhood of Southwingfield, under the command of a leader, deputed from the town of Nottingham, armed with pikes, and some guns, assembled about 12 o'clock in the night of Monday the 9th inst. in Wingfield Park.-They proceeded at once to break open all the farm houses, and possess themselves of all the guns, and fire arms, *of which they had accurate accounts*, which were found on them. At Mr.Hepworth's, a most horrid and wanton murder was committed: In consequence of the noise on the outside of the house, the servant man came down stairs to the kitchen, and having refused to open the door, and deliver his master's gun to the insurgents, he was instantly shot through the window, which had been broken, and fell dead. This shocking act appears to have created no sensation of disgust in any of the insurgents;-they proceeded to break open other houses; and referred to the murder, only to enforce their threats, and intimidate those who shewed the least reluctance to join them!!

At the same hour a party of insurgents, assembled in the adjoining village of Pentridge, the Seat of the conspiracy, & the place of residence of *a most notorious and active Hampden Club delegate*. This party proceeded to Pentridge Lane end, to await the arrival of their Commander, and associates from Wingfield Park. The junction being formed, they moved forwards through the village of Pentridge. From this place they dispatched a Courier to Nottingham, and took considerable reinforcements both of men and arms. They then proceeded to Butterlly ironworks, thence to Ripley, and along the Turnpike Road to the top of Codnor Common, where they halted. In the mean time other parties were advancing from Swanwick and the villages round Alfreton, and from, Ripley, Codnor, Heanor, Ilkeston, and many other places, armed in the same manner, and evidently under the same directions; but we hear with the utmost satisfaction that the insurgents experienced great disappointment at the Butterly iron works, and that but very few, if any, of the men in the service of Messrs. Jessopp and Co. joined them voluntarily. From Mr. Jessopp, and Mr. Goodwin the manager of the works, they met with that determined resistance which men of their excellent understandings, political and moral characters will ever make to projects of such a nature.

The insurgents remained nearly an hour at the public house at the northwardly end of Codnor Common, probably in the expectation of further reinforcements, and dispatches from the town of Nottingham.-Here notwithstanding the refreshments which were given to them by their commander, their spirits became evidently depressed. Their numbers amounted to about three hundred but they had expected a much greater augmentation,-and tho' it was now about six o'clock, they were without intelligence of the expected surrender of the Barracks, and the town of Nottingham to their associates in quarter. Still they proceeded onwards towards Langley Bridge, the last village in this county. Between Codnor and Langley they met the Pentridge Courier on his return from Nottingham. He delivered his dispatches to the Commander, and they were proclaimed to be of the most favourable nature.— "*Nottingham*, it was said *was given up—the soldiers in the Barracks would not stir*"-and the insurgents were ordered to push forward and join their victorious comrades. But there was something in the countenance and conduct of the Courier— and the subsequent movements of the commander which contradicted the report of this intelligence. The messenger himself disappeared ;—the commander quitted the rear of the party and took the lead of it; he quickened his march; and became regardless of the desertions which took place at every cross road and corner. However they proceeded as far as Kimberley, at which place their numbers were reduced to about fifty—here they were met and immediately repulsed by a party of Hussars under the command of Captain Phillipps from Nottingham, accompanied by Charles G. Mundy and Lancelot Rolleston, Esqrs. two most active Magistrates for the county of Nottingham. Several prisoners, and a considerable number of pikes, guns, pitch-forks and other offensive weapons were taken and carried under an escort of the Hussars into Nottingham.

Whilst these proceedings were going forward on the eastwardly side, the utmost alacrity prevailed in this part of the county. It is impossible to do justice or speak in terms of sufficient praise of the exertions of the Rev. Stead Hope (our worthy Mayor,) and to Richard Leaper, and Thomas Lowe, Esqrs. the acting magistrates of this Borough, to whose vigilance we are indebted for the early discovery of the plot, and for the preparations which were made for the suppression of the insurrection, Under their orders a company of the 95th Regiment under the command of Captain Hellerman, was on duty throughout the night of the 9th instant, and in the course of the night two troops of the Derbyshire Yeomanry Cavalry, under the command of Major Sir Robert Wilmor, Bart., were brought into the town with the utmost privacy.

Intelligence of the insurrection having actually appeared was conveyed to our police office at an early hour on Tuesday morning. Orders were immediately issued for the two troops of Cavalry to hold themselves in readiness to march ;- and the Calke and Ashborne troops were sent for. Upon the arrival of the Calke troop, which assembled with wonderful expedition, having its full complement of eighty privates, excellently mounted, and in the best possible order, Major Sir Robert Wilmot(accompanied by Bache Heathcote and Godfrey Meynell, Esqrs. two of our most active county magistrates) proceeded in two divisions towards Ripley and Langley Bridge; but before they could reach those places the Chesterfield troop of Yeomanry Cavalry (under the command of Captain Wright,) which had been on duty on the preceding day, and re-assembled on Tuesday morning at Alfreton with a degree of expedition and alacrity which entitles them to the highest credit, had marched in pursuit of the insurgents, and had left Sir Robert Wilmot and his party but little to do beyond the escort of a numerous body of prisoners, and a considerable quantity of guns, pikes, and other weapons, which they lodged in the County Hall in Derby.

It appears that about one hundred prisoners have been sent since Tuesday to Derby & Nottingham. The Magistrates have been sitting ever since, and tho' they have discharged several whose cases were of a nature to admit of such lenity, upwards of sixty remain in custody; and many of them will probably be brought to trial for the offences which they have committed. We regret that it is not in our power to inform our friends that the Commander of the insurgent party has been taken. He has hitherto evaded the pursuit which has been made after him; but we still hope that he will be taken. The second and third in command are in the gaol of this country.

Lord George Cavendish, (the Vice Lieutenant) and E. M. Mundy, Esq. (our county Member,) left town immediately upon receiving intelligence of the insurrection, and reached Derby on Thursday last. On the following morning Lord George attended the Magistrates at the county hall, and afterwards set out for Alfreton and Chesterfield, from whence he proceeded to Chatsworth and through the Peak.

The Right Hon. Lord Scarsdale, D. P. Coke, J. Balguy, B. Heathcote, J. Crompton, J. Radford, G. Meynell, Esqrs. and the Rev. F. Wilmot, have regularly attended the daily meetings of the Magistrates in Derby; and W. Halton and W. A. Lord, Esqrs. two active magistrates for the hundred of Scarsdale, are sitting at Alfreton or Ripley. The Mayor and Magistrates of the Borough are also in constant attendance at the Police Office. It is impossible to do justice to the incessant and unwearied exertions of all these Gentlemen to restore the tranquility of the county—to relieve the innocent—and to bring to justice and punishment the guilty.

We have the utmost satisfaction in recording the determined opposition which the insurgents received from the farmers and most respectable inhabitants of Wingfield Park, Pentridge, Ripley, and other places where these atrocious and disgraceful proceedings have been exhibited. To this disposition, aided by our civil and military establishments, and to a vigorous execution of the Laws of our country, we look with confidence for the suppression of any further attempt which may be made to disturb the peace of the county.

In the preceding account we have abstained from mentioning any of the names of the prisoners. But we understand that an inquest has been taken by Mr. Gosliag, the Coroner, upon the body of Robert Walter, (Mr. Hepworth's servant,) who was shot in the night of Tuesday the 9th inst. in his master's house in Wingfield Park; and that a verdict of wilful murder has been returned by the Jury against William Turner, Joseph otherwise Manchester Turner, Robert Turner, Isaac Ludlam, William Ludlam, and William Barker.
