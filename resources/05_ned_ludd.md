# Ned Ludd

I supsec that most people today are familiar with the term "Luddite", often used as an insult, to describe someone who is reluctant to use, or adopt, any technology invented after the technologies they grew up with.

Some may even claim to know the origin of the term, in the form of a certain Nedd Ludd. But fewer people know *his* supposed story. Or the stories of the original Luddites, the frame-breakers and machine breakers of the north of England just over two hundred years ago now. Or even the price they paid for their actions.

So let's start with the myth, and the character of "Nedd Ludd"? Who was he, and why is it his name that became attached to the machine breaking protests that started in the second decade of the 9th century on the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border?

NED LUDD.  
There are few persons in this part of England who know any thing of the history of the Stocking frame, and who probably not heard that it was the invention of William Lee, of Calverton, in this county, a student in the University of Cambridge. This gentleman, it is said, being in love with a young lady, found that her incessant occupation in knitting, left her no leisure to receive his addresses, and that resentment for slighted love, prompted him to invent a machine, which should supersede the necessity of knitting.

At present, a person named Ned Ludd, is become more famous, by the destruction of this machine, than William Lee, by its invention. Ned Ludd is not, as many people suppose, an ideal personage; but is, or lately was, an inhabitant of Austey, near Leicester, where he was apprenticed to learn the art of frame-work knitting. Ned being rather adverse to confinement of the frame, did not exert himself to the satisfaction of his master, who complained of him to the Magistrate. As a remedy for Ned's disorder, the Magistrate, it is said, recommended a little whipping. This, however, was so far from curing the patient, that he took the first opportunity of getting a great hammer, and entirely demolishing the machine, which he considered as the occasion of his punishment.

Hence the persons who have lately repeated Ned's operation, on a very extended scale, in this and the neighbouring Counties, have thought proper to assume his name and conceal their own.
