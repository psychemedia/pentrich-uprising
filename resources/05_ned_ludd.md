# Ned Ludd

I supsect that most people today are familiar with the term "Luddite", often used as an insult, to describe someone who is reluctant to use, or adopt, any technology invented after the technologies they grew up with.

Some may even claim to know the origin of the term, as deriving from the name *Nedd Ludd*. But fewer people know *his* supposed story. Or the stories of the original Luddites, the frame-breakers and machine breakers of the north of England just over two hundred years ago now. Or even the price they paid for their actions.

So let's start with the myth, and the character of "Nedd Ludd", or as he was properly known, *Edward Ludlam*? Who was he, and why is it his name that became attached to the machine breaking protests that started in the second decade of the 9th century on the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border?

NED LUDD.

There are few persons in this part of England who know any thing of the history of the Stocking frame, and who probably not heard that it was the invention of William Lee, of Calverton, in this county, a student in the University of Cambridge. This gentleman, it is said, being in love with a young lady, found that her incessant occupation in knitting, left her no leisure to receive his addresses, and that resentment for slighted love, prompted him to invent a machine, which should supersede the necessity of knitting.

At present, a person named Ned Ludd, is become more famous, by the destruction of this machine, than William Lee, by its invention. Ned Ludd is not, as many people suppose, an ideal personage; but is, or lately was, an inhabitant of Austey `(sic; Anstey)`, near Leicester, where he was apprenticed to learn the art of frame-work knitting. Ned being rather adverse to confinement of the frame, did not exert himself to the satisfaction of his master, who complained of him to the Magistrate. As a remedy for Ned's disorder, the Magistrate, it is said, recommended a little whipping. This, however, was so far from curing the patient, that he took the first opportunity of getting a great hammer, and entirely demolishing the machine, which he considered as the occasion of his punishment.

Hence the persons who have lately repeated Ned's operation, on a very extended scale, in this and the neighbouring Counties, have thought proper to assume his name and conceal their own.

On the 4th of November `[1811]`, the system of framebreaking was renewed, by an attack made on the house, &c. of a Mr. Hollingsworth, of Bulwell, where several frames were broken; and from this time, the work of destruction was carried on with very little intermission to the end of the year. The desperate measures adopted by the workmen in this neighbourhood, may be truly said to have had a serious effect upon the repose of the whole of this county, as well as those of Derby, Leicester, York, and Lancaster; in as much as the system pursued by the framebreakers, or, as they termed themselves, LUDDITES, was adopted by the rioters in those several counties. The framebreakers assumed this appellation from the circumstance of an ignorant youth, in Leicestershire, of the name of Ludlam, who, when ordered by his father, a framework-knitter, to square his needles, took a hammer and beat, them into a heap, The practice of these men was to assemble in parties of from six to sixty, according as circumstances required, under a supposed leader, that was stiled *General Ludd*, who had the absolute command of them, and directed their operations; placing the guards, who were armed with swords, firelocks, &c. in their proper peaces, while those armed with hammers, axes, &c. were ordered to enter the house and demolish the frames; and when the work of mischief was completed, he called over the list of his men, who answered to a particular number, and he then gave a signal for their departure, by discharging a pistol, which implied that all was right. In consequence of these outrages being continued, a considerable military force was brought into the neighbourhood; two of the London police magistrates, with some other officers, came down with a view of assisting the civil power in discovering the ringleaders; a considerable sum of money was also placed at the disposal of a secret committee, for the purpose of obtaining private information; but in disregard of the offers of the secret committee, in contempt of the regent's proclamation, in defiance of the vigilance of the powers, both civil and military, these deluded men continued their course of devastation for several months, and at the end of February, 1812, it was found that no less than six hundred and twenty-four frames had been destroyed.

1812. In February, the framebreaking prevention bill was introduced to the Commons, and in March received the royal assent. By this act, (which was to continue in force no longer than the 1st of March, 1814,) the breaking of a stocking or lace-frame was made death, without the benefit of clergy.

At the lent assizes, seven of the framebreakers were convicted, and ordered for transportation, four for fourteen and three for seven years.
