TO DO luddite bicentenary


MR. PRINTER—I think it may be attended with good to the community, but particularly to all those deluded men who are connected in any manner with the unhappy murderers who yesterday paid the debt due to their most inhuman crime—if you will thro' the medium of your paper give the following to the public; about nine o'clock yesterday morning, Mellor, Thorpe and Smith, ascended the scaffold; after some time being spent in prayer with the ordinary they each addressed themselves to the Almighty, in a manner the most penitent.—The voices of Thorp and Smith were indistinct, few expressions were heard by the spectators.—Mellor spoke in a most audible manner; and if all his accomplices had heard him, they must have hearts harder  than flint, if they had not been melted into tears, and resolved, by spending the remainder of their life in repentance, to atone to their country for the dreadful injuries they have inflicted on her domestic tranquillity.

After dwelling a long time on the sins of his past life, which he confessed to be of the blackest nature, he said—But thou who cast Devils out of Mary Magdalen, thou who pardonest the thief upon the Cross—Thou canst still save thieves, aye and EVEN US POOR MURDERERS! He prayed fervently for those who were connected with him—that they might, from the present awful scene, be lead to repent of their great sins, and cease from pursuing those lawless measures which could only tend to their eventual ruin. He said—There are many here who have come expecting to see us die game! Let such know that we die penitent—we acknowledge the heinousness of our sins, and our only hope to be forgiven is in the infinite and boundless mercy of our Redeemer.

After having thus made his confessions to the Almighty, he rose from his knees and addressed himself to the spectators in nearly the following words—"There are many here whom I know, and many of my enemies, some who have urged me to the commission of the crime for which I am now to forfeit my life. I freely forgive you, and all the world, and I hope the world will forgive me." These were his last words.

Never was there a sight more awful!—would that every inhabitant of this disturbed district had been there: then surely we should cease to hear of those detestable acts of villany, which have of late been so daringly perpetrated.—I conclude by wishing that the end of these three penitent murderers, may be a warning to all who are disposed to disturb the peace of the country.

AN ATTENTIVE HEARER.

[at end of trial report]

On Friday, the three murderers were executed on the New Drop behind the Castle; after the usual prayers with the Ordinary, they each of them prayed a considerable time, and confessed the heinousness of their crime; Mellor, addressing the populace, said—"there is some people there that has brought me to this, but I freely forgive them, as I hope to be forgiven"— After hanging the usual time, their bodies were taken to the York County Hospital to be dissected and anatomised, agreeable to their sentence. Since their condemnation, they have behaved in a penitent and contrite manner, regretting sincerely the crime for which they suffered.

THE EXECUTION.

On Friday, about nine o'clock in morning, Mellor, Thorpe, and Smith, ascended the scaffold: after some time being spent in prayer with the Ordinary, they *each* addressed themselves to the Almighty in a manner the most penitent. The voices of Thorpe and Smith were indistinct, few expressions were heard the spectators.— Mellor spoke in most audible manner; and if all his companions had heard him, must have hearts harder than flint, if they had not been melted into tears, and resolved, by spending the remainder of their life in repentance, to atone to their country for the dreadful injuries they have inflicted on her domestic tranquility.

After dwelling a long time the sins of his past life, which he confessed to be of the blackest nature, he said, "But THOU who cast devils out of Mary Magdalen,— THOU who pardonest the thief upon the Cross,—THOU canst still save thieves, — aye, and EVEN US POOR MURDERERS!" He prayed fervently for those who were connected with him.— That they might, from the present awful scene, be led to repent of their great sins, and cease from pursuing those lawless measures which could only tend to their eternal ruin. He said,—There are many here who have come expecting to see us die *game*! Let such know that we die *penitent!* We acknowledge the heinousness of our sins, and our only hope to be forgiven is the infinite and boundless mercy of our Redeemer.

After having thus made his confessions to the Almighty, he rose from his knees and addressed himself to the spectators in nearly the following words,—"There are many here whom I know,— a many of my enemies,—some who have urged me to the commission of the crime for which I am now to forfeit my life. I freely forgive you, and all the world, and I hope the world will forgive me."—These were his last words.

After hanging the usual time, their bodies were taken to the York County Hospital, to be dissected and anatomized, agreeable to their sentence.

The views of these deluded men are pretty clearly developed by the testimony of Hinchliffe, in the case of Scholefield. The latter told Hinchliffe, that "they were waiting to get a body of men within the liberty of  Holmfirth,— they had got such a body at Huddersfield, and they waited to get a body of men at all other places, and then they might all start, in a moment, and overturn the Government!"

Meetings were regularly held, and there were delegates from Manchester, Leeds, and other places.— Scholefield, to induce Hinchliffe to be LUD, told him, "that all the officers and men, except one serjeant, in a whole regiment, were *twisted in*; besides four of the Queen's bays!" Such were the schemes of these misguided men.

TO DO luddite bicentenary

In our last publication, we inserted an account of the execution of the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, which contained the following paragraph:—

"George Mellor prayed for about ten minutes; he spoke with great apparent fervency and devotion, confessing in general, the greatness of his sins, but without making any confession of the crime which he suffered."—This statement is controverted by an anonymous writer in the Intelligencer, who asserts that Mellor admitted in his prayer at the place of execution, that he was a murderer.—We can only repeat, that our statement was perfectly correct; and re-assert but neither in his prayer, or in any other part of his address, to be make the confession imputed to him by the writer; nor did he say one word about not dying game. The fact is this:—These men were impressed with a conviction, a most erroneous one, that the wicked and abominable oath of secrecy they had taken was binding upon their consciences. This fact we have from the best authority, from a Gentleman whose official capacity gives him the best opportunity of observing the demeanor and conduct of the prisoners, and who was present on the fatal occasion. This Gentleman also distinctly stated to the writer of this paragraph, that neither Mellor, or any other of the prisoners, did, in any manner, make any admission of their guilt. He had also the same assurance from the Rev. Brown whose office it was to attend these unhappy men in the last moments. To which we would add his own personal testimony, for conceiving it as a part of his duty, and a painful duty it was to be present at the execution of these unhappy men, he attended to all that was said by them, with the most anxious solicitude, to ascertain whether they had profited by the admonition of the Judge in making a confession of their guilt: but he did not hear a single expression admitting that they were guilty; much less a confession, in direct terms, that they were murderers. We have conceived it a duty we owe to ourselves and to the country, to state the grounds upon which we made, and now justify the assertion in our last publication, "that the murderers made no confession of their enormous crime." That they were godly, no reasonable being that has heard or read the evidence, can entertain a particle doubt.

And the obstinate silence of the prisoners on this subject furnishes an additional doubt, if one were wanting, of the direful effects produced on the minds of ignorant men by the horrible plan of which we have unhappily heard so much, and by which numbers of deluded men have been induced to remain in a confederacy of which they disapprove, and to conceal crimes the most horrible. The prisoners at the place of execution, certainly made no protestations of their innocence.

CONFESSION OF THE MURDERERS.

Mr. PRINTER.—The Editor of the *Mercury* has taken great paths to controvert the account I gave you, of the murderer Mellor's Confession on the scaffold, by positively asserting "that neither in his prayer nor in any other part of his address did he make the confession imputed to him." In reply to this I will maintain that my published statement is a correct one, and that Mellor did actually make use of the expression "*imputed*" to him— "US POOR MURDERERS." Certainly no one who was present and listened with any attention to the culprit, can deny this fact. The Editor of the Mercury may not have heard this expression, (he did hear, however, what nobody else heard, that the Jury recommended Smith to mercy.) Or, if he did hear the confession, he may, for aught I know, have very *prudent* motives for concealing it from the Public. I was not the only person who heard the confession—it is corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses.

EXECUTION.

After sentence of death had been passed upon the persons convicted of making the attack on Mr. Cartwright's Mill, at Rawfolds, and of the Burglaries, fifteen in number, all of them except John Lamb, who was reprieved, were removed to the condemned-ward, and their behaviour in that place was very suitable to their unhappy situation. They confessed that they had offended against the laws of God and their Country, but on the subject of the offence, for which the sentence of death was passed upon them, they were very reserved; yet all of them except one, tacitly confessed that they were guilty of the crimes for which they stood convicted, for when they were asked if any of them could say they were not guilty, they all remained silent except James Haigh and Nathan Hoyle, the former of whom said, "I am guilty," and the latter, "I am innocent;" this was the day before the execution; but Hoyle did not make any declaration to that effect when brought to the platform. Their minds for the most part had attained an extraordinary degree of composure; except the mind of John Ogden—he appeared for some time to be much disturbed, but on the question being put to him whether his agitation arose from any discovery that he had to make, and with the weight of which his conscience was oppressed? he answered, no; his agitation arose from the terrors of his situation.

And here it seems proper to observe, that if any of these unfortunate men possessed any secret that it might have been important to the public to know, they suffered it to die with them. Their discoveries were meagre in the extreme. Not one of them impeached any of their accomplices, nor did they state, as might reasonably have been expected, where the depot of arms, in the collection of which some of them had been personally engaged, was to be found. When interrogated on this point, some of them disclaimed all knowledge of the place, and others said, Benjamin Walker, the informer against Mellor, Thorpe, and Smith, could give the best information about the arms, as he had been present at most of the depredations. On the question being put to them whether they knew who was concerned in the robbery of a mill (not Rawfolds) near Cleckheaton; James Hey said, "I and Carter the informer were present at the robbery." It was observed to James Hey, that it was very extraordinary, that he who had had the advantage of a religious education, his Father being of the Methodist Society, should have come to such a disgraceful situation; to which he replied, in a manner that shewed that his vices, however flagrant, had not extinguished in his bosom the feelings of filial affection, "Father, say it—"the son's crimes will never be imputed to his father." The principal part of these ill-fated men were married and have left families. William Hartley, has left seven children, their mother, happily for herself, died about half a year ago. John Ogden, wife and two children; Nathan Hoyle, wife and seven children; Joseph Crowther, wife pregnant, and four children; John Hill, wife and two children; John Walker, wife and two children; Jonathan Dean, wife and seven children; Thomas Brook, wife and three children; John Swallow, wife and six children; John Batley, wife and one child; John Fisher, wife and three children; Job Hey, wife and seven children; James Hey, wife and two children; James Haigh, wife, but no children. On the morning before the execution, the eldest daughter of Hartley obtained permission to visit her wretched parent, when a scene took place which we will not attempt to describe. The heart-broken father wished to have been spared the anguish of this parting interview, but the importunate intreaties of his child at last prevailed, and they met to take a long farewell, never again to be repeated in this world. What must be the feelings of an affectionate father, (for such in this trying moment he appears to have shewn himself,) when, though standing on the brink of eternity, he declines to see a darling child; how great an aggravation of his punishment must those parting pangs have inflicted, and how loud an admonition does this melancholy incident suggest to the Fathers of families, against entering into combinations that may place them in the same inexpressibly afflictive situations. It was Hartley's particular request that the public should be informed of the number and unprovided situation of his orphan family.

At eleven o'clock on Saturday morning, the Under Sheriff went to demand the bodies of John Ogden, Nathan Hoyle, Joseph Crowther, John Hill, John Walker, Jonathan Dean, and Thomas Brook. They were all engaged in singing a hymn:

Behold the Saviour of Mankind,  
Nail'd to the shameful tree;  
How vast the love that him inclin'd. 
To bleed and die for me, &c.

Which one of them dictated in a firm tone of voice: and in this religious service they continued on their way to the platform, and some time after they had arrived at the fatal spot. They then joined the ordinary with great fervency in the prayers appointed to be read on such occasions, and after that gentleman had taken his final leave of them, ejaculations to the throne of mercy rose from every part of the crowded platform.

Joseph Crowther addressing himself to the spectators said, "Farewell Lads;" another whose name we could not collect, said, "I am prepared for the Lord," and John Hill, advancing a step or two on the platform, said, "Friends! all take warning by my fate; for three years I followed the Lord, but about half a year since, I began to fall away; and fell by little and little, and at last I am come to this; persevere in the ways of godliness, and O! take warning by my fate!" The executioner then proceeded to the discharge of his duty, and the falling of the platform soon after, forced an involuntary shriek from the vast concourse of spectators assembled to witness this tremendous sacrifice to the injured laws of the country.

The bodies having remained suspended for the usual time, they were removed, and while the place of execution was yet warm with the blood of the former victims—the remaining seven, namely, John Swallow, John Batley, Joseph Fisher, William Hartley, James Haigh, James Hey, and Job Hey, were led at half-past one o'clock from their cell to the fatal stage, their behaviour, like that of their deceased confederates, was contrite and becoming; James Haigh expressed deep contrition for his offences. John Swallow said he had been led away by wicked and unprincipled men, and hoped his fate would be a warning to all, and teach them to live a life of sobriety and uprightness. They all united in prayer with an earnestness that is seldom witnessed in the services of devotion, except in the immediate prospect of death. A few moments closed their mortal existence, and placed them at the bar differing from all earthly tribunals in this infinitely important particular—here, owing to the imperfections of all human institutions, repentance though sincere, cannot procure forgiveness—there, we have the authority of God himself for saying, that the cries of the contrite and broken hearted shall not be despised. Charity hopeth all things.

The criminal records of Yorkshire do not perhaps afford an instance of so many victims having been offered in one day to the injured laws of the country. The scene was inexpressibly awful, and the large body of soldiers, both horse and foot, who guarded the approach to the castle, and were planted in front of the fatal tree, gave to the scene a peculiar degree of terror, and exhibited the appearance of a military execution. The spectators, particularly in the morning, were unusually numerous, and their behaviour on both occasions, were strictly decorous and becoming.

TO DO check above

*THE SUPPOSED CONFESSION.*

Mr. EDITOR,—"An Attentive Hearer" seems to be a very pertinacious one. He set out with asserting, that George Mellor, one of the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, in his prayer on the fatal platform, speaking of himself and his fellow-sufferers, used the words, *"us poor murderers,"* and said, "There are many here who have come expecting to see us die game." These words, you say, were never used; on which he repeats his former assertion; and such conflicting testimonies, on a topic of general conversation, naturally produces the enquiry on which side truth is to be found. Feeling this curiosity, in common with many others, and not being myself present at the execution, I determined to ascertain the fact of the case from the best authority; and for this purpose I addressed myself to the Ordinary, to the Under Sheriff, and to the Governor of the Castle, all of whom concurred in stating, that they did not hear either of these expressions, and that they were persuaded they were not used by any of the malefactors. Not satisfied with this, I next enquired of a number of the Sheriff's Officers, who stood within a pace or two of the culprit when he delivered the prayer or address, in which "An Attentive Hearer" says the words occurred, but they all, except one, agreed with the gentlemen mentioned above, and that officer said, that he thought he heard some expression of the kind, but he was engaged at the moment, and could not be quite certain. I then applied to some of the spectators who stood in front of the drop, and they confirmed the declaration of the officers, that the words imputed to Mellor were not used by him. Some of the persons said, that in speaking of the forgiveness of Christ, he enumerated signs of several kinds, to which his forgiveness was extended, and concluded the sentence with saying, and "even to *his* murderers," but that no such abhorrent word as "*game*;" abhorrent I mean in that sense, fell from Mellor's lips. I am therefore of opinion, and I think my authority will not be thought weak, that as to one of the expressions "An Attentive Hearer" has fallen into a mistake, and as to the other he has indulged in a bold figure of speech.

But as he may still, from "*prudent* motives," reiterate his assertion, I will place the matter in a way that may make the dispute not quite so uninteresting to the public as it might otherwise appear; and for this purpose I have lodged ten guineas in the hands of my printer to be applied to the use of the General Infirmary at Leeds, if an "Attentive Hearer" can, out of the vast concourse of spectators that attended the execution, produce six persons of character who will assert, on their word of honour, that Mellor used the words which he has put into his mouth, and I challenge this "Attentive Hearer" to offer the same sum to be applied to the same purpose, on my producing twice that number of persons of veracity, from amongst the spectators, who will assert, that neither Mellor nor his fellow-sufferers, used either of those expressions. As to their guilt there cannot be a particle of doubt, the point at issue is the confession. I was, Sir, not "An Attentive Hearer," but I have been.

TO DO luddite bicentenary

Mr. Printer,—"A Diligent Enquirer" has certainly taken great pains to ascertain whether Mellor did or did not acknowledge itself and his companions to be murderers, and it appears that those persons he has communicated with did not notice the confession. I believe there were present a great many more persons who did not hear Mellor make use of the expression alluded to, but this is no proof that what I advance is false.—"A Diligent Enquirer" says that some of the persons whom he enquired said, Mellor's words were, "even to his murderers." That these persons are mistaken is evident, as he was addressing himself to Christ, and not speaking of him.—His words were—"Thou who cast devils out of Mary Magdalen—thou who pardonest the thief upon the cross—thou canst still save thieves, aye, and even us poor murderers."

The words us and his, are very similar in sound, so much so, that they might easily be mistaken the one for the other, but their meaning is so very different, it will always be possible to determine which is spoken.—In this instance "A Diligent Enquirer" and the public must, I think, determine it in favor of "the word I have put into Mellor's mouth," us. Otherwise the sentence is rendered very unmeaning.

Wagers are in my opinion no argument, and I am astonished that "A Diligent Enquirer" should propose this mode of settling any dispute.—But his wager is particularly objectionable; if I understand it right, in all probability both parties must lose.—If it be necessary, I can produce respectable testimonials of the truth of what I have advanced. "the word of honour of persons of character," that Mellor did make use of the expression alluded to.

*To the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer.*

SIR,—Having seen your Paper two Letters signed "*An Attentive Hearer*," wherein he asserts that Mellor in his prayer begged of God to forgive "*us poor murderers*."

I think it a duty I owe to the public to contradict the assertion, as no such expression was uttered by him, neither was any acknowledgement of guilt for the offence, made at any time, by him or his companions, directly or indirectly, either to me or the public; so far from any thing of the sort taking place, when I put the question in their last moments, "*I hope you acknowledge the justness of your sentence?*" The answer was "I desire you will not ask me any questions on the subject." Notwithstanding which, no man in his senses can entertain a doubt of their guilt. I am afraid your *Attentive Hearer* has mistaken the word *adulterers* (which Mellor made use of in his prayer) for *murderers*, as there is a little similarity in the sound.

I am, Sir, your humble servant,

The following Letter, addressed to the *Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer*, by the Rev. G. Brown, Chaplain of the Castle of York, is decisive of the point at issue between the "Attentive Hearer" and the "Diligent Enquirer," and can indeed leave no room for further discussion or doubt upon the subject. It is hardly necessary to observe, that the situation of the Rev. Divine who remained on the fatal platform, close to the prisoners, during the whole of the mournful ceremony, must render his authority, as to what was said by the Prisoners, infinitely superior to that of any hearer, however attentive, necessarily placed at a considerable distance, and where words imperfectly heard might be easily misconceived. And if the "Attentive Hearer" possesses a single particle of candor, he will hasten publicly to retract his confident assertions, and apologise for an insinuation most unfounded, and which can only be protected from the charge of malice by successive folly and absurdity.

Mr. PRINTER—Sir, when you in inserted my first Letter respecting the execution of Mellor, Thorpe and Smith, the Editor of the Mercury, in a very handsome manner, informed his readers, what I advanced was absolutely false.—To my second he made no reply; his cause was then espoused by "A Diligent Enquirer," the dispute seemed nearly ended; we had only one word to settle; I was persuaded "A Diligent Enquirer," if he were also a Candid Enquirer, would decide in my favour. From his silence this week, I must conclude he is now of my opinion. The dispute, in all probability, would have ended here, had not the Rev. George Brown, Chaplain of York Castle, thought it a duty he owes to the public, tho' late, boldly to step forward and controvert my assertion.

He first positively contradicts me, and then kindly tells me where I may have been mistaken; he fears I have understood the word "Adulterers" for "Murderers."—He is just one week too late; had he made his appearance sooner, he might, perhaps, have staggered the belief of many.  "A Diligent Enquirer" has already satisfied the public on that head, he has informed them that the obnoxious word "Murderers" did escape from Mellor's lips; but his printer thinks this ought to be surrendered, that no person is so likely to be right as the Reverend Chaplain; nay, that it would be the height of folly and absurdity to dispute his authority.—The Editor of the Mercury is once more roused—after such strong, such respectable testimony, that both "An Attentive Hearer" and "A Diligent Enquirer" have been the instruments of publishing falsehoods to the world, nothing can protect them from the charge of malice or insanity, if they do not immediately retract all they have said, and bow to the super-eminent respectability of the Rev. George Brown, Chaplain of York Castle.

So the Editor of the Mercury would have it.—What effect this appeal will have on "A Diligent Enquirer," I will not surmise; tho' I am willing to give the Reverend Chaplain all the credit his well-established character deserves, I will not be so credulous as thus to bow at his nod. No, I will even yet dare to inform the public, if I had before been inclined to doubt whether I was right or wrong, the enquiries I have since made of persons who were also present, would have removed every doubt.

One observation more for the Rev. George Brown, Chaplain of York Castle, and I have done:—Two newspapers printed in York (the Courant and the Herald) in the account they gave of the execution, state that the murderers "confessed the heinousness of the crime." How strange that this Reverend Gentleman, who feels he has such a duty to perform to strangers, should have no regard for his fellow citizens, but will silently allow them to be dupes of "mischievous" Editors; he has no pity for them—what else can be his reason for taking no notice of these gross falsehoods;—did the old proverb ever recur to his mind—"A Prophet is not honoured in his own City?"— I am, &c.

To the EDITOR of the LEEDS MERCURY.

SIR,—"An Attentive Hearer" shines more as an ingenious quibbler, than as a faithful Narrator. His declaration, that the Editor of the Mercury has pronounced a Diligent Enquirer a publisher of falsehoods, is as far from the truth as his unblushing assertion—that Mellor, the malefactor, in his last address, talked about dying Game! and as erroneous as the declaration, that he used the expression "us poor murderers." The truth is, that I wished to give as candid a constitution to the publication made by "An Attentive Hearer," as possible, and therefore hazarded a supposition that he had mistaken "his murderers" for "us poor murderers;" but, so far from publishing a falsehood on the subject, I merely stated this as a matter of conjecture.

By why should I dwell upon a point already established beyond the possibility of reasonable doubt, though not beyond the reach of quibbling pertinacity; and why insist on a subject, on which there is but one opinion, and that opinion is, that "An Attentive Hearer, either from intention or error, or partly from both, has put into the mouth of a dying man, words that he never used.

What could be his motive for so committing himself, in the first instance, it is not easy to imagine; but it is probable, that after having told the story publicly, he thought it more magnanimous to proceed in error, than to retrace his steps into the paths of truth; perhaps too he had a wish to enjoy a laugh at his printer, by trying how far he could be made the dupe of such a marvellous story; and his printer, in order, I suppose, to resent the affront, and to render the DYING SPEECH MAKER as ridiculous as himself, insisted Mr. Brown's contradiction immediately under "An Attentive Hearer's Letter;" so that they now laugh at each other; and they may rely upon it, that the public would, if the subject was not too grave for merriment, laugh at them both.

I am yours truly,

Mr. PRINTER.—Sir, —The Chaplain and the Editor are this week silent, and a "Diligent Enquirer" has once more entered the lists; it must however be confessed his temper is not improved by his retirement. When he first set out on his Enquiry, he declared he wished to ascertain, whether I was right or wrong, and this was as it should be: the public are the best judges whether his published Enquiries have not strengthened my assertion: he has now however fallen from his respectable situation, and instead of remaining a "Diligent Enquirer", he has degraded himself by turning, a Vile Defamer; he now seems wishful to end this affair in a personal quarrel, and that too, on the same polite terms as one might reasonably expect, from the regular frequenters of a common alehouse. I before told him, I conceived there was no argument in wages, and I now inform him, I am sure there's none in railing and abuse; that cause must be tottering, which stands in need of such support.

In answer to this week's letter I would refer him to that inserted by himself in the Leeds Mercury of 23d January. He there publishes the report of those of whom he had enquired: he says, some informed him Mellor made use of the following expression, "even to his murderers;" he now calls this, "only hazarding a supposition." I cannot even give him credit for being "an ingenious quibbler." It stands published in the form of an assertion, a positive assertion of persons, whom of course he could depend upon, or he would not have been the means of publishing their report; now when Mr. Brown and the Editor say it is false, he wants to get rid of it; he says he merely "hazarded a supposition and that for the purpose of giving as candid a construction as possible to my publication." The public must here again decide. I agree with a diligent Enquirer that my declaration, "that the Editor of the Mercury has pronounced a "diligent Enquirer," a false publisher, is as far from the truth, as that Mellor made use of the words "Die Game" and "us poor murderers." I maintain they are all true. To prove the former to be a fact, I would refer a "Diligent Enquirer" to Mr. Brown's letter of the 30th of January. Mr Brown says that the word was not "murderers," but "adulterers," and the Editor remarks his authority is indefinitely superior to that of any other; he then adds if "an attentive hearer" possesses a spark of candour, he will hasten publicly to retract his confident assertion, &c.

I grant he does not link his friend the "Diligent Enquirer," with the "Attentive Hearer;" he certainly gives me the lie direct, for having introduced the word "murderers" into Mellor's prayer, and if the Diligent Enquirer can pocket this affront, he exercises more charity towards his friends, than from what I know of him, I should suppose him incapable of.

I have not the slightest objection to engage any of my antagonists, when they come forward like gentlemen, but if in future they shall appear clothed in raillery and abuse, I must beg leave to pass their remarks unnoticed.

I am, Your's, &c.

TO DO luddite bicentenary

MR. EDITOR—It is much more difficult to silence than to confute "an Attentive Hearer:" but I will make another effort to submit his assertions to a test from which it will not be easy for evasion itself to rescue him. In his last letter he again asserts, that Mellor, at the place of execution, used the expressions "die game" and "us poor murderers." I say, that neither of these expressions fell from his lips. Here then is an assertion against assertion, only with this important difference, that, to a certain extent, the reverend gentleman who attended the malefactors in their last moments, confirms my declaration, and falsifies that of my opponent. But for the present I will wave Mr. Brown's authority, decisive as it is, and consider the matter as resting merely on the ipse dixit of an anonymous writer. Men whose names have no reason to expect public credence, in any disputed case, except so far as their assertion are supported by the authorities: here then we come to the pinching point—let "an Attentive Hearer" produce his authorities confirmatory of his assertions, and I will produce mine; and by way of a beginning, I will undertake to produce the names of six persons, who were all present at the execution, all men of indisputable character and veracity, and all so situated at the time as to hear distinctly every word that was uttered, and who will one and all declare most positively that the words put into Mellor's mouth by "an Attentive Hearer," were not uttered by him; it being understood that an "Attentive Hearer" shall produce an equal number of authorities, of character equally free from suspicion, who will declare that Mellor did use those words; and to avoid further evasion, it shall be at his option whether the names of the authorities be published, or merely handed to the printers of the respective papers, for the the inspection of those that may interest themselves in this wire-drawn dispute. His election on this point he will make in his next letter.

Should he decline this challenge, as he did the wager of charity, he will be truly chargeable with having attempted to practice upon public credulity, and with having, for six weeks, amused the readers of the Intelligencer with unsupported fictions.

TO DO luddite bicentenary

Mr. PRINTER—A Diligent Enquirer seems to be rather hurt that I have not allowed myself to be publicly accused, without endeavouring publicly to defend myself; he thinks I ought to have been silenced long since; he will, however, recollect I am not answerable to the Public for the length of this dispute.

In the first instance I stated what passed at the Execution, as nearly as I could remember, which has weekly been disputed by either one or another.—Mr. Brown came forward and positively contradicted my assertion. I believe a Diligent Enquirer and an Attentive Hearer and not the only persons who are willing to waive his authority.—And now, we will consider the matter as resting on the authority of two anonymous writers, one of whom was present at the Execution, and the other some miles distant. Certainly persons unknown to the public have no right to expect credit, unless there assertions can be proved, either by positive or corroborative proof;—but there is a difference even in the character of an anonymous writer. When any one is fairly proved to have published an untruth, we have a right at least to suspect him; if a Diligent Enquirer will take the trouble to refer to my last letter, he will find a blemish on his character, of which he has not even attempted to clear himself. As an anonymous writer, I think I have a [fairer] claim to public credence than my opponent; he has a length, however, come forwards like a gentleman, without either wagers or abuse, and is consequently entitled to my attention.

I am not at liberty to publish names, but if he will be at the trouble of enquiring of my Printer; he will be informed of several Gentleman, whose characters he cannot dispute, to whom I would refer him; and I hope he will not think it too much trouble, candidly to inform the public the results of his further enquiries; this I think I have a right to expect from him.

THE POINT AT ISSUE

A dispute of little interest perhaps, except to the disputants, has for some weeks been maintained to the Leeds Newspapers which we hope now to bring to a close, and to this end it is necessary to take a short review of the circumstances in which it originated. It is well known to the public, that on Friday the 8th of January, George Miller, William Thorp, and Thomas Smith, who had on the Wednesday preceding, been convicted on the clearest evidence of the atrocious murder of Mr. Horsfall were executed at York; at that awful scene, a person from the office of this paper attended, and the report made by him through the columns of the Mercury was that "George Mellor confessed in general the greatness of his sins, but that he made no confession of the crime for which he suffered." This statement an anonymous writer, under the signature of "an *Attentive Hearer*," contradicted in the Intelligencer on the Monday following, by asserting that Mellor confessed himself a murderer at the place of execution, and that he also used this remarkable expression, "not die game." On such conflicting testimony, a controversy arose in which an *Attentive Hearer* continued to maintain that Mellor used both these expressions; and in his second letter he insinuated that the Editor of the Mercury had private reasons, "*prudent* motives" was his expression for concealing the truth; and this attack at once absurd and unfounded, was entirely unprovoked, as a reference to the papers up to that time will show. To contend in person with an adversary without a name, and who had made so free and use of his aegis, and of his spear was to oppose a substance to a shadow; we therefore saw it proper to place the combatants on equal grounds, and with that view, to take the signature of "*A Diligent Enquirer*." Under these designations the contest continued for some weeks, when by way of bringing this tedious dispute to an issue, the *Attentive Hearer* was challenged by his opponent to an exchange of authorities, which being accepted, this exchange took place, and the result of the inquiries to which it has given rise, we now submit to the public.

The names of the persons produced by a Diligent Enquirer in confirmation of his assertions amount to seven in number, consisting of the Gentleman who officiated as Under-Sheriff, the Governor of York Castle, the Reverend Gentleman who attended the prisoners in their last moments, and two Sheriff's Officers, who all stood upon the platform, none of them at a distance of more than three or four yards from Mellor, and some of them at his elbow; in addition to these five authorities, the *Diligent Enquirer* also verified his assertions by the names of two persons who stood in the place usually occupied by spectators, and all of whom had declared to him, that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the words in question were not used, and to these he might have added the names of a number of other persons, the principal part of whom stood upon the platform; but he selected these as evidences of the most unexceptionable kind, and as amply sufficient to satisfy any man open to conviction.

The authorities produced by an Attentive Hearer amounted to five in number, only one of whom stood on the platform, and such of the others as were present, at a distance of 40 or 50 yards.

The first of these, he that stood upon the platform, says, that he did hear Mellor use the words, "*us poor Murderers*," but he heard no such words as "*not die Game*." The second and third make the same declaration. The fourth says, that he thinks he heard the word murderers used in a confessional sense, but he cannot be quite certain, as he stood at so great a distance, that he could only hear a sentence now and then; but as to the words "not die game" he heard no such expression. The fifth and last of an Attentive Hearer's authorities is a Reverend Gentleman at York, and he says, that he was never present at an execution in his life, and consequently that he was not present at the execution of Mellor, nor did he ever say that the account given by an Attentive Hearer "was correct."

Such are the authorities by which the assertions of the contending parties are supported, and on a comparison of this evidence, we think no man that will exercise his understanding can fail to arrive at a just conclusion. We have no more doubt that the persons who say Mellor used words amounting to a confession so understood him, than we have that Mellor and his fellow-sufferers were guilty of the crime for which they were executed, but we believe they were murderers, and this belief we ground on the testimony of those whose stations the place of execution gave them an opportunity of hearing distinct every word that fell from the lips of the culprits, and whose official duties required that they should be particularly watchful over the expressions of men dying under such circumstances, and none of whom, it is universally allowed, had up to the moment they came to the fatal tree, made any confession of their guilt, express or implied.

On the other terms are remarkable and so improbable—we mean the expression "not die game," an Attentive Hearer is in effect contradicted by all his own authorities, excepting only that which was not present. Here at least he must admit that he is in error, for not to make that admission would be to impeach the testimony of his own evidence; and this circumstance will, we hope, be useful to him in future life, by inculcating the necessity of being less confident in his own opinions, and more disposed to defer to the opinions of others.

TO DO luddite bicentenary

Mr. PRINTER.—Sir,—It is indeed painful to trespass on the patience of your readers, by so repeatedly calling their attention, to a subject which at first might appear trifling and unimportant; that the murderers were guilty there can be no doubt: it must however be satisfactory to the public to be assured that they confessed guilt: viewing it in this light, I am compelled again to appear before the public. On the 9th January, I communicated to you my statement of the execution of Mr. Horsfall's Murderers, in which I informed you, that the following sentence was used by Mellor in his prayer: "Thou who cast devils out of Mary Magdalen, thou who pardonest the thief upon the Cross,—thou canst still save thieves, aye and even us poor murderers." The three last words, "us poor murderers," A Diligent Enquirer has continued constantly and positively to contradict.

He confesses he was not present; but has repeatedly boasted of his authorities; and on all occasions drawn up a Noble Phalanx of official Characters, Persons who, from their consequence at executions, must of course hear for all. These, he has always vociferated, were quite positive the words were never used, one would have supposed they would have been equally confident—but No, they will not see him through; they only now, to use his own language, "declare to him that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the words in question were not used;" here am I left without an opponent. After all the vaunting of my adversary, he at last publishes his own infamy; and positively contradicts himself: indeed so fond have my antagonists been of contradiction, they have at no time hesitated pointedly to controvert the testimony of each other.

If the Diligent Enquirer had in the first instance spoken the truth, he would have required no answer. When he so readily showered down such volleys of abuse, and so confidently boasted of his positive information, one would have supposed he had at least some authorities to produce; this week however he publicly confesses he has none—had my report been unaccompanied by the testimony of any other, I have fair claim to public credit; not one who can positively contradict me!!—But my assertion is corroborated by the authority of other persons, "Gentlemen of character" who do not merely state, that, "to the best of their knowledge and belief" they heard Mellor confess himself and his companions to be murderers. No—they state positively that they distinctly heard the words. Here then is a proof positive that I am correct; I do not expect the "Diligent Enquirer" will allow this; when he introduced himself to me, he candidly told me "he would not be convinced." The public however will not be thus duped. The truth of my assertion as far as relates to "us poor murderers" is now most positively established, "the Diligent Enquirer" himself being the reporter. In my letter to you of the 9th January, I also quoted the following passage from Mellor's Prayer: "There are many here who have come expecting to see is die Game, let such know that we the penitent—we acknowledge the heinousness of our sins, and our only hope to be forgiven is in the infinite and boundless mercy of our redeemer."

The "Diligent Enquirer" and his friends have also objected much to the expression, "Die Game," it has however remained the one of their own authorities to be a corroborating evidence to the use of it; he states that he distinctly heard the words "die Game" used when Mellor was praying, but he believes it was not Mellor that used them—I hope my opponent will be convinced that those words did not originate with myself; that they were used is now certain; and that they were not used by Mellor, yet remains to be proved.

The "Printer's" paragraph respecting the Reverend Gentleman, at York, reflects no credit on its author; had it been necessary to have further proofs of his duplicity, he has furnished me with one. If he chose to notice part, he ought to have mentioned all. When I gave him the names of my references, I mentioned to him that I had just been with a friend who told me a Gentleman had said, that a Reverend Gentleman who resides in York, had mentioned the circumstance, stating that he was on the platform at the time, and that the "Attentive Hearer" was correct. I informed him, I believed that gentleman would corroborate what I said;—it was of course impossible I could have written to him, up having only heard this a few hours before I was with the "Diligent Enquirer;" he cannot say I mentioned the Reverend Gentleman's name, in any other way, than as now stated by me.

I must apologize to your readers for trespassing so long, but cannot take leave of this subject without recommending my opponent, when he again undertakes to contradict any one, to have better grounds for his confident and positive assertions; and not amuse his readers with vapouring about a long list of Authorities, whose testimony in the end, according to his own statement, amounts to nothing. Let him take a view of his abusive language, throughout the whole of this dispute. Let him remember what he has charged me with; then look to his authorities, and after all see himself absolutely obliged to publish my vindication.—Let him do this and refrain from blushing if he can!

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 27 March 1813

It must be admitted on all hands that an Attentive Hearer "*dies game,*" or after the figure he has already cut, he would never have written another letter of half a column, turning upon a mere verbal quibble—a distinction without a difference.— If he be not extremely ignorant of the nature of evidence, he must know that the testimony of witnesses speaking "according to the best of their knowledge and belief" is regularly received in our courts of justice. Indeed knowledge and belief are the only grounds on which a man can with certainty aver any thing. Will his authorities say that his assertions are true according to the best of their knowledge and belief? He knows they will not. But it is vain to reason with a man who has lost both his cause and his temper, and who is now evidently contending not for truth, but for the last word. The public have long been convinced that he is in error, and if any thing would have fixed upon his own mind the same conviction, it would have been the fact of his having produced, with no small difficulty, *five* witnesses to support his dogmatical assertions, three of whom contradicts one half of what he says! a fourth could not distinctly hear!! and the fifth was not present!!!

Mr. PRINTER,—My Opponent this week declares me dead; had it been so, his paragraph might have passed; I would have to know that I am "Game," and still living, ready at all times to assert the truth.

My adversary would fain be thought learned in the law of evidence. It is not however the first time he has made a great noise about what in reality he is perfectly ignorant of. I will endeavour to make this subject intelligible to him, and suppose a case brought before a Jury, in which four respectable persons shall positively declare they were witnesses of a certain fact, and all agree in the account they give of it: to contradict which, seven persons, equally respectable, shall give the following testimony:—Six shall declare they cannot positively say how it was; one, to the best of his knowledge and belief, it was not stated correctly by the four first witnesses; and every one of the seven, when interrogated as to the real fact, shall each give a different account of it.—I would ask the "Diligent Enquirer" if he were one of the Jury, how would he decide?—This is a plain case, exactly similar to our own, four persons of character declare that they distinctly heard the confession of Mellor. Out of seven brought to oppose, six say they cannot positively remember how it was; and one, to the best of his knowledge and belief, thinks it was not so; and all differ in their opinion as to what really said.

The "Diligent Enquirer" may quibble over this if he can: he knows I can prove it to be fact: his cause seems to stand by quibbling, railing and abusing, in which polite attainments he has indeed eminently excelled in the controversy I have had with him; it would be well for him if he would learn in future to be more cautious how he commits himself. One untruth is in general the father of another, so he has proved it. If it were necessary to answer his paragraph at length, I would do it and prove him again wading in falsehoods. The public must however be tired of this dispute, the subject of it is now for ever settled: that the murderers of Mr. Horsfall were declared by their Ringleader to be "Murderers." I believe none will now dispute excepting the "Diligent Enquirer," who has already declared he will not be convinced.—Well might Hudibras say,

Convince a man against his will,
He's of the same opinion still.

An "Attentive Hearer" is more invincible than Dr. Goldsmith's Village Schoolmaster. *His* witnesses, he says, in his last letter, speak *positively*. Do they, indeed!—Is it not, then, positively to deny one half of what he produced them to prove, and thereby to cast discredit upon the other half? And has he not, by referring to these witnesses, fixed upon himself, incontestably, the imputation of having put words, and very remarkable words too, into the mouth of a dying man that he never used? Let him answer these questions, and let the answers he is obliged to give, prove to him that he is not quite infallible, and teach him to be less dogmatical and more circumspect in future. Of the seven witnesses produced by [???], he says, speaks of his knowledge and belief and [???] the other six declare that they "cannot positively say how it was." This we know to be an incorrect report of the result of his enquiries; it is, in fact, a falsification of the evidence; and to proof of this, we challenge him to publish the verbal and written testimony of those seven witnesses, and thus to give the public an opportunity of judging how much his assertions are to be relied upon, whether they regard the expressions of the dead or of the living.

Mr. PRINTER,—In reply to the "Printer's" Paragraph this week, I inform him, that my Witnesses do speak positively, they state positively that they distinctly heard Mellor's Confession. The "Diligent Enquirer" knows this, and he also knows he is the author of a wilful untruth, when he says they contradict one half of what I say: they do not contradict one word of what I have advanced! he is not ashamed, in order to make his defeat appear less complete, to shelter himself behind a battery of falsehood.

And forsooth, unblushingly to charge me with falsifying the Evidence of his Authorities! a charge which I shall prove to be as false, as all his other attempts to prove me in error.

First then I will state what I said respecting them: my words were "Out of seven brought to oppose them, (i.e. my authorities,) six say they cannot positively say how it was; and one, to the best of his knowledge and belief, thinks it was not so." For this my Opponent publicly charges me with falsehood; with having given as evidence what I was not warranted in doing. Let him read the following Paragraph; "We the undersigned were present at the Execution of Mellor, Thorp and Smith, and we believe that Mellor never made use, (in his prayer just before the execution) of the words, "us poor murderers;" and, "Die Game;" and we are of opinion if he had used them, we should have heard him; but we cannot positively say, we should have heard and remembered them." This is a literal Copy of what five of his authorities have affixed their names to, and must consequently be taken as their testimony. The sixth was asked to sign the above, or the following; "We the undersigned, were present at the execution of Mellor, Thorp and Smith, and distinctly heard every word Mellor used in his prayer, just before he was executed; and we are positively certain that no such words as, "us poor murderers" and, "Die Game;" fell from his lips; and we are sure if they had, we should have both heard and remembered them."—He however refused to sign either, but stated, if he were to sign one, it would be the former; he observed, "he was of opinion the words in question were not used," but added "at such times my mind is so taken up with what is passing, that I cannot positively say he did not use them."—The seventh refused to sign either one or the other; and said he was of opinion the words were not used; so that the last paragraph stating that they were positively certain, remains without a single signature—It may be necessary here to observe, that nine persons were named by the "Diligent Enquirer," two of whom had already made themselves parties in the dispute, and consequently have never been treated as Authorities by either party; seven being the number allowed on both sides.

I have now complied with the "Printers" wish, and "published the written and verbal testimony of his seven witnesses;" which he declares, I have falsely stated in my last Letter. The result of my enquiries is correctly given above, as nearly verbatim as possible; and I defy any one, to prove in any one instance, that it is contrary to my last report. Let it be remembered that the above Gentlemen, were declared by the "Diligent Enquirer," to be quite positively certain I was wrong! Has not the result of my enquiries, proved his report to be a falsification of Evidence?—This charge however he has falsely laid on me; I challenge him to prove his assertion; and if he fail, I call upon him publicly to declare himself in error; and confess he has falsely charged me with a Lie. If he refuse to do either, I have no hesitation in publicly declaring him, to be every thing that a Gentleman ought not to be.

In the beginning of this controversy my opponent proved himself to be truly expert in the language of abuse; now, he weakly asserts with the most unblushing effrontery, things which he knows to be false; if in future he should expect me to notice his observations, I must beg he will cease to insult his readers with his palpable falsehoods;—if he will not deviate from truth, I am ready at all times to answer his remarks.

TO DO - from luddite bicentenary

An "Attentive Hearer" is at his usual work again. He has not, as was required of him, published the words of the person referred to, but he has published expressions foisted into their mouths by others. He had, we know, the testimony of one or more of our witnesses written and signed by themselves, in which it is positively declared that Mellor did not use either of the expressions imputed to him; but this he has suppressed, and substituted in its stead declarations, artfully framed, that they did not write, and that some of them, very prudently, refused to sign! This is what every man of plain dealing, will call a falsification of evidence. He has not, he says, applied to two of the persons we referred him to, because they are parties! What party could the Clergyman who attended the criminals to their last moments be in this dispute? or what possible interest or motive could he have for publicly and positively contradicting an Attentive Hearer, except a wish to prevent the public being imposed upon by fabricated dying speeches? This was, no doubt, the motive that actuated his conduct, and no men of common sense, or of common candour, will attribute to him any other. But the subterfuges of this Attentive Hearer are endless, and if there be a single individual in the county who can still retain a doubt on the subject, we see only one way left to remove such doubt, and to relieve the public from the further annoyance of this uninteresting dispute.

The mode of affecting so desirable a purpose is this:—He shall give up his authorities, and we will give up ours, to two perfectly impartial persons, and they shall, without any leading questions, but in a fair and honourable manner, obtain the testimony of the parties; that testimony, pro and con, with the places the witnesses occupied at the time of the execution, and the official situations they held, if any, shall be published in both the Leeds papers, without "note or comment;" the public will then be able to form an unbiased judgment, and there the matter shall rest. If he accepts this proposal, it will, we are persuaded, appear as we at first stated, that as to one of the expressions an Attentive Hearer was mistaken; and that from a similarity of terms, a few, and only a very few, other spectators, principally standing at a distance of 50 or 60 yards, fell into the same error. But as to the other expression it will be manifest, even on the shewing of his own witnesses, that it is a mere invention. This will appear if he ventures in the way we now propose fairly and finally to commit the point at issue to the decision of the public; but should he shrink from this unexceptionable test, the inference will be obvious, and we shall then feel ourselves absolved from taking any further notice of effusions that affect so much, and exhibit so little of the Gentleman.

On this subject, we last week received a Letter from a Gentleman at York, who was present at the execution, and who heard, distinctly, every word that was uttered, in which the writer says:—"Pray, Sir, who is the Attentive Hearer that has so long insulted the ears of the West-riding with his notorious falsehoods? He is ashamed to sign his name, and well he may; I am astonished at his impudence."

Mr. PRINTER,—The evidence given by the "Diligent Enquirer's" Authorities, is already verbatim before the public; I hold a letter from one of them, written after an interview with the Diligent Enquirer, speaking as to his knowledge in terms which were not so decisive as I wished. I wanted to have no ambiguity; if the parties were positive, I wished them to say so, if not, they would allow it; this they all did, not one was certain! The person who wrote the letter above alluded to, signed the paragraph stating he was not positive.

The printer has charged me with falsifying the evidence of his authorities, and not giving their own words. I deny the charge; the evidence I have published is true, the very words of his own witnesses; I can at any time prove this. Let the "Printer" prove his assertion, and I will willingly fall in with his proposition this week; of submitting the whole to two impartial persons. There is no need to do this, until my antagonist has proved his point; if I have already stated the case correctly; why trouble any other person to re-publish it?

He says nothing about himself having falsified the evidence of both mine and his authorities; I before charged with this! I repeat it!

Until he proves his assertion; or acknowledges that he has falsely charged me with an untruth; I shall take no notice of his weekly ebullitions, but leave him to that infamy, his repeated falsehoods deserve.

An *Attentive Hearer* has declined the challenge we last week gave him to close the dispute, by submitting the evidence on both sides, fairly and candidly collected by impartial persons, without note or comment, to the tribunal of public opinion. The inference is irresistible. He was conscious that such an appeal would admit of no sophistry or false colouring, and that the preponderance of evidence against him would have been overwhelming. But we shall indulge in no exultation, much less repeat the coarse and virulent language that disgraces his last letter; it is the language of an irritated mind writhing under the pangs of defeat. We have no such feeling to gratify; Truth alone was *our* object, and having secured its triumph, to the satisfaction of every impartial mind, we quit the ungracious subject for ever.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 26 April 1813

If the "Printer" will be at the trouble to read the "Attentive Hearer's" last letter, he will perceive that his last week's challenge, is by no means declined. The Attentive Hearer is most willing to go into the proposed investigation when it is rendered necessary;  i.e. so soon as the Printer shall prove what he has twice asserted: "that the "Attentive Hearer" has published a false report of evidence."—If the report he has published be correct, there can be no doubt of the confession of Mellor. If false, let it be proved so; and the "Attentive Hearer" will, with the greatest readiness, immediately accept the Challenge of his Opponent.
