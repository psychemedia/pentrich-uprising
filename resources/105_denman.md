Publication date 1873
eg ch VI https://archive.org/details/memoirthomasfir01arnogoog/page/n114/mode/2up?q=brandreth DEFENCE OF BRANDRETH AND OTHERS FOR HIGH TREASON

incl. p108
Every man his skill must try,  
He must turn out and not deny;  
No bloody soldier must he dread.  
He must turn out and fight for bread;  
The time is come, you plainly see,  
When Government opposed must be.
