The time was now approaching when Denman was to emerge from the comparative obscmrity of mere provincial reputation, and obtain a wider and more general recognition of his abilities.

In the summer assizes of 1816 he was extensively retained for the defence of various Luddite prisoners, charged with machine-breaking and rioting. The exertions thus imposed on him, in addition to his ordinary circuit work, which had now become considerable, were pretty severe. To his brother-in-law, the Rev. R. W. Vevers, he writes on September 4 of the circuit then recently concluded as the 'most intriguing and harassing that has ever befallen me.' It was also the most profitable he had ever had, and he had about the same time been able to send to his wife, who was then with her children at Margate, the welcome intelligence that *on balancing his banker's accounts, he found them favourable beyond all expectation.'

That he acquitted himself with great abiUty in defence of his imfortunate clients is sufficiently attested by the quaint records in the Circuit Book, which contains the following entries relating to the period now referred to:

Summer Assizes^ 1816. — Mr. Denman congratulated on a puflF from the judge : ' One comfort is, your defence cannot be in better hands.' — One guinea.

Mr. Beynolds congratulates Mr. Denman on a gross puff


from the judge at Warwick: *The learned and eloquent counsel, who has defended his client most ably.'

Derby, — The Attorney-General [i.e. of the circuit] presents Mr. Denman for the horrible and merited applause which he received in court at Nottingham.

Before proceeding to relate the facts of the case, which in the next year, 1817, had so much to do with raising the forensic reputation of Denman, a word or two is necessary as to the nature and causes of these Luddite outbreaks. The operatives of Nottinghamshire and the adjacent midland counties had for some years been in a state of chronic discontent — breaking out from time to time into spasmodic acts of violence. It may be remembered that Byron, in 1812, a few days before the publication of 'Childe Harold,' ^ had made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, on a Nottingham Frame-breaking Bill, by which, with the usual policy of those times, it was attempted to repress increasing discontent by increasing severity. The young peer produced considerable effect by his solemn declaration— the declaration of a man of genius who saw vividly into the real truth of things, and on this occasion spoke what he thought — 'I have traversed the seat of war in the Peninsula, I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey, but never under the most despotic of infidel governments have I beheld such squalid wretchedness as I have seen, since my return, in the heart of a Christian country.' The misery Avliich Byron thus described in 1812, instead of diminishing, went on increasing. The Dra-

conian laws, whose policy he denounced, had, as he prophesied would be the case, wholly failed in their object. Nothing was done to improve the social conditions in which these excesses of desperate and famishing men had their origin, and in a few years the discontent and the danger increased to a still more alarming point.

There probably never was a period of our history in which there was so much wretchedness and consequent disaffection among the English lower classes as in the four or five years that immediately followed the close of the Great War. The glory and the excitement of the conflict were over, and the country was left to sustain as it could the enormous burdens imposed by the gigantic struggle. Taxation had never been so oppressive. No Factory Laws had interposed their humane regulations between the avarice of Capital and the sufferings of Labour. The administration of the Poor Laws, giving a positive premium to improvident marriages and numerous families, and making of the poor serfs of the parish, if not of the glebe, was utterly destroying the independence, and materially interfering with the free labour, of the peasantry. The Corn Laws, aided in their malign operation by the occurrence of one or two deficient harvests, kept bread up almost to a famine price. The voice of complaint in the House of Commons could only make itself feebly lieard ; for the House of Commons, under the rotten-borough system, was itself under the paramount influence of the land-owning and capitalist classes. Under Lord Liverpool's administration, the grim triumvirate of

Eldon, Sidmouth, and Castlereagh were resolute in repressing all change. Repressive laws, bayonets, and the gcdlows, were the only remedies they would admit of for popular discontents.

The principles of the French Eevolution, which had been carried by the arms of Napoleon over every part of the Continent, shaking thrones, subverting feudalism, radically changing the laws of property and inheritance, had gained no effectual foothold in England, protected from their influence by her * inviolate ' isolation, and her obstinate and successful resistance to the great conqueror. Here the principal effects produced by the great and terrible convulsion had been to animate the possessors of property with a resolute determination to resist all change, and to stir up the proletariate to occasional acts of hopeless insurrection, in the vain quest rather of political Utopias than of real political and social reforms. The working classes were then without the knowledge or the organization they have since acquired. They obeyed only the promptings of a blind despair : the wildest schemes were advocated, the most violent and hopeless enterprises resorted to.

The year 1817 was signalized by several of these attempts at insurrection.*^ It was a period of great and terrible distress. The summer of the preceding year had been one of the worst ever known in England : the rains had been incessant^ the harvest was a complete failure, wheat stood rotting in the fields as late as the middle of November. In the next winter, spring,

and summer the price of bread was as high as it had been during the worst years of the war : the profits of trade had been greatly reduced, the demand for our manufactures had diminished, numbers of operatives were thrown out of employment — ^the suflferings of the poor had reached a climax.

In no part of the country was the distress greater than in Nottinghamshire and the neighbouring counties; and in this district, during the summer of 1817, the people broke out into various acts of armed insurrection.

Among these, one of the most conspicuous was that headed by Jeremiah Brandreth, popularly known in those parts as the 'Nottinghamshire Captain.' It presents a melancholy picture of the ignorance and the desperation of the operatives of those days.

On Sunday, June 8, 1817, at the village of Penkridge, in Nottinghamshire, Brandreth, having convened a meeting of his followers at a public house called the White Horse, proceeded to unfold to them his plan of insurrection. A general rising, he assured them, had been organized with a view of bringing about by armed force a change of government. The party headed by himself was to commence operations on the next night, Monday, June 9. They were to provide themselves with fire-arms by requisitions on the various householders resident in the district, and, when thus supplied with weapons, were to march on through the night to a place of general rendezvous in Nottmgham Forest, where they were to be joined by other bands of insurgents from various parts of the

Midland Counties. Brandreth addressed his followers sternly and briefly, repeating at the close of his remarks the homely lines of some rustic Tyrtasus which embodied the pith of his rugged harangue.'

On the Monday night, as arranged, the insurgents began their march: arms were obtained by threats and violence from several householders too terrified for resistance. A Mrs. Hepworth, more courageous than the rest, withstood the demand, barring her front doors and windows at the approach of the tumultuary force : Brandreth ran round to the rear of the premises, and, firing through the back kitchen window, killed an unfortunate man-servant on the spot. The ruthless act answered its immediate purpose: arms were given there and elsewhere without further resistance, and the insurgents marched on through the night towardsNottingham. Meanwhile the authorities had been alarmed. The yeomary were assembled, and when morning dawned on the straggling and desperate band they saw themselves confronted by a force which made resistance hopeless. They dispersed rapidly, without risking an encounter, strewing the ground with the weapons they had so lawlessly obtained.

The leaders of the abortive enterprise, who were speedily captured, were tried for high treason, before a Special Commission, which was opened at Derby, on

October 14, in the same year, under the presidency of Chief Baron Richards. The offence with which they were charged was * levying war against the king.' Copley, who had greatly distinguished himself on the trial for high treason of the Watsons in the early' part of the year, led for the Crown ; Denman (Mr. Serjeant Cross with him) was retained for the defence of the principal prisoners — ^Brandreth, Turner and Ludlam.

The facts were clearly proved, there was no question as to the identity of the prisoners — the case was really a hopeless one for the defence. All that could be done was to contend that the facts proved did not sustain the charge of high treason by levying war against the king^ but only amounted to an aggravated riot

Denman's argument on this point in the speech for Brandreth was powerfiil, and ably supported by reference to all those venerable authorities,* by virtue of which, in charges of high treason, the accused, in Erskine's phrase, 'stands covered all over with the panoply of the law.'

One of his principal topics was the total and ridiculous inadequacy of the proved means to the alleged object.

The question [h3 said] is, has war been levied and raised ? The charge is the levying war against the king,

and I deny that thk is a levying of war against the king. Something positive, distinct, and defined is absolutely necessary to distinguish a treason from a riot, and I put it to every one of you whether that is not the impression on your own minds. What did these men mean? What did they do ? Oh, they meant to overturn the G-ovemment, What measures did they propose, what steps did they take to effectuate that atrocious purpose? Did they intend, or in reasonable language, had they anything like a practicable contemplation of subverting the Government by levying war against His Majesty — ^the mightiest monarch on the face of the earth — ^with these few miserable men as their army, with even their neighbours against them, with more than overpowering resistance at every house to which they came, with the exception of a few, and particularly that where the unfortunate occurrence took place of which you have so often heard* They were defeated almost without opposition, and at once put down without a blow.

The advocate put it clearly to the jury that what he pressed for was not an absolute acquittal, but only an acquittal on the charge of treason by levying war against the king.

I am not [he said] asking impunity at your hands. God knows the unfortunate men brought here to-day are liable to punishment, even when you shall have dismissed them. God knows, if the evidence affecting this unhappy man on other charges besides that of treason be taken to be true, there is but little fear he will escape with impunity. Too many laws have been violated, too many feelings have been wounded, to suppose that this matter should be passed lightly over. I think it is not to be expected, and I tell you so fairly, feeling as I do that this is a public duty I am performing. I tell you fairly that I do not wish to see these persons escape with impunity. I think they ought to be pimished, that they ought to be made sensible of their crime,

and that others ought to be warned by their example. But do not let it be by a strained construction of positive law, which cannot be effected without violating the security of all the king's subjects and the stability of our free constitution.

Notwithstanding the efforts of his counsel, Brandreth, under the direction of the presiding Judge (Chief Baron Richards) that armed insurrection for the purpose of effecting a change of government amounted in ' construction ' of law to a levying of war against the king, was convicted of high treason.

In his speeches for the other two principal prisoners. Turner and Ludlam, Denman endeavoured to find an additional topic of defence in the commanding and overbearing influence of Brandreth (undoubtedly a man of extraordinary powers), which, as he contended, hardly left the responsibility of free agents to those who were acting under his orders and were the mere puppets of his iron will.

In his speech for Turner,* the advocate drew a striking picture of the insurgent leader:

Gentlemen, you have seen that man, you were present in court when he was arraigned ; you were present in court during his trial, you were present in court when he received his verdict of guilty, I will ask you whether you ever saw a more extraordinary man, a man more evidently gifted by nature with the talent of swaying the minds of the common people with that sort of instinctive influence which even in his humble station there is no resisting — the influence of great courage, of uncommon decision, of unrelenting fimmess ; the influence of an eye like no eye that I ever beheld before, of a countenance and figure formed for

activity, enterprise, and command. Even the dark, strange beard he wore, and his singular costume, seemed to accord with his wild and daring character. The witnesses had seen him but once before, in the night, several months ago, and never paused for a second look — they recognised him in a moment. Like the captain of a band of pirates, or the head of a troop of banditti, he was obviously one of those persons who have in all ages exercised the most absolute control over people in their condition, and to whose natural superiority their moral and physical forces have ever yielded implicit homage. He was their leader — a stranger in the midst of them- -sent over from Nottingham or some other place to delude these miserable men. You heard the tales — the wretched tales he told of a rising in one place and a rising in another ; whether he believed them or not, we know that they were entirely false, but they proceeded from him alone, and such are the means by which a few starving villagers were urged to commit all these outrages for bread. It is not wonderful, gentleman, that they had neither intellect nor strength of mind to question his authority, when you saw even the witnesses in the box, who unwillingly attended him in his desperate expedition, speak of him as the ^ Captain ' in terms of involuntary deference and respect. It was he who directed this wild career of mischief; it was he who stepped forward when a daring act was to be done; it was he who gave the tone and spirit to them all; nor would they have stirred a step without his influence and command.

In his speech for Ludlam, instead of repeating his own description of the ' Nottinghamshire Captain,* he quoted from Byron's * Corsair ' the splendid and wellknown lines which depict the personal appearance of Conrad, and reveal the secret of his influence over his followers,® * a passage,' said the speaker * which will

perfectly bring before you the character, and even the appearance of Brandreth — ^the commanding qualities of his powerful but uncultivated mind, and the nature of his influence over those he seduced to outrage.' ^

Turner and Ludlam, like Brandreth, under a similar direction from the presiding judge, were both convicted of high treason, and all the three were respectively sentenced to be hanged, beheaded, and quartered.

The sentence was pronounced on October 25, 1817, and on November 7, as the grim record runs, 'Jeremiah Brandreth, William Turner, and Isaac Ludlam the elder, were drawn on a hurdle to a platform erected in front of the county gaol of Derby, where they were hanged till they were dead; when they were cut down and their heads were severed from their bodies ; His Eoyal Highness the Prince Eegent, in the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, having graciously remitted the remainder of the sentence, the quartering.'

Although Denman failed in procuring an acquittal, which, indeed, on the clearly proved facts of the case, under the ruling of the Court, and in the alarmed temper of the times, would have been a practical impossibility, yet the spirit, the manliness, and the high tone of his speeches for the defence had attracted con-

His name appals the fiercest of his crew, And tints each swarthy cheek with ashen hue ; Still swajs their souls with that commanding art That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart What is that spell that thus his lawless train Confess and envy, yet oppose in vain ; VHiat should it be that thus their faith can bind P — The power, the nerve, the magic of the mind.

He was henceforth regarded as a man marked out for future eminence.

The following passages from a letter to Merivale, written in the Long Vacation that immediately preceded this celebrated trial, will show how laboriously Denman prepared himself for his important task. It gives also some particulars, not devoid of interest, as to his literary tastes and as to the then status of two of his old college friends, Hodgson and Bland, while it suppUes still fiirther information as to the singular man who headed the Nottingham rising, and whom Denman had just been retained to defend.

My dear Merivale, — I felt myself a very shabby fellow for not at once accepting your challenge, and sending you a letter of three sheets from Leamington [where Denman had been spending part of the Long Vacation], nor do I well know what has prevented me except downright idleness.

Ligue,' *® tey great good luck I found it and was delighted. Bland I saw often.'' He seems to be going on vexy comfortably, and is in good spirits and as entertaining as ever. Hodgson was with him one day, the picture of health, and with a stock of learning (according to Bland) increased by his solitary life in the High Peak to a superhimian extent.'* Tom " is become a very decent companion : we rode a journey of sixty miles, from Leamington in Gloucestershire, on a visit to the Baillie's, who live in one of the most beautiful wooded valleys in the world.'*

To-morrow I go to London on my way to Fontainebleau. My particular reason for making this journey is that I may have copiplete leisure to pursue without distraction my studies on the subject of High Treason. Of this I knew ten days ago as much as I do of the practice of the Court of Chancery, but since it will be my duty about a month hence to defend some of the persons who are to take their trials in Derbyshire for that offence, it is my duty to be able at least to talk a language intelligible to those who know something on the subject. I shall cram Hale and Hawkins (* Pleas of the Crown '), Gribbs, Wetherell, and Copley, with unremitting assiduity.'^ The fees to be taxed on this occasion will not make any man's fortune, as every man among them is as destitute of money as common sense, and the great ringleader of them all has actually for many years been receiving parish relief. His name is Brandreth: much is said of the

Perhaps you may be as much puzzled as I was to find out the force of this reason for despising life: it turned out, on enquiry, tliat his livelihood had depended on making hose of a particular description bearing that name, and for which, in the change of fashion, there had ceased to be any demand.
