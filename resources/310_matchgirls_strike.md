TABLEAUX VIVANTS AT SOUTH KENSINGTON. The Anglo-Danish Exhibition and Fete was formally opened yesterday. In a woo den theatre erected in the grounds it has been arranged to give daily a series of iabieazuxr viatnis, suggested by the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen; and Mr. Savile Clarke has undertaken to direct the performances. Of these the firs. was given last night befoie a specially invited company that included the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince Karl ofDenmark. The structure accommo- dates a thousand people, and although its holding capacity is not likely to be put to the test, there is no doubt but that this novel feature ofthe Exhibition will be popular, especially with children. Last night illustrations were given of five of Andersen's tales-" The Little Match-girl,;' "The Emperor's New Clothes," " Tommelise," " The Swineherd," and "The Marsh-King's Daughter,"' in which characters were represented by Misses Winning, Bowman, Thornton, and Messrs. Ettinson, Norton, and Little, supported by groups of courtiers, citizens, peasants, or fairies. Occasionally choruses were introduced to add to the poetical effect of the pictures. If these did not in all cases tell much of a story, they were unexceptionable on the score of beauty, and would have borne a longer inspection than the few seconds during which they remained visible.

Strike at Bryant and May's.

There has been a strike at Messrs. Bryant and May's match factory. The facts, as stated by their manager, are, that on Wednesday morning one of the girls employed in cutting wood was required to manipulate her work in the manner desired. She refused to do so, and this being regarded as an act of insubordination she was discharged. In consequence, about 1,100 girls went out on strike. There was not work for the men and they had to go out also. Up to a late hour last night there was no sign of a compromise.

Nottingham Evening Post - Saturday 07 July 1888

The Bryant and May strike may attract good deal of attention before the matter is ended. The millionare Bryants of this firm aro Gladstonians, philanthropists, and social reformers. As a rule, Mr. Stead, of the *Pall Mall Gazette*, may be taken as a prophet of their particular section of the community. The *Pall Mall*, however, seems to have raised a hornet's nest about the heads of Messrs. Bryant and May which has ended in a strike. Conflicting stories are in circulation as the cause. The *Pall Mall* asseverates that the strike in question is to be attributed to the discharge of some girls who were alleged to have made revelations to some of the Social Reform people who in other matters act with the heads of the firm. At the present moment feeling is running very high the subject in the East End.

THE STRIKE BRYANT & MAY'S.

This morning 160 girls, employed at wax vesta making at Bryant A May's, returned to work, and measires have been taken protect them. The girls on strike assembled near the works this morning, and marched to Mile End Waste, where they were addressed by Socialists and others. They then proceeded in a body to the Thames Embankment. where they were to be met by members of Parliament, and present a petition to the Home Secretary.

THE STRIKE AT BRYANT AND MAY'S.

In an interview with correspondent of the Press Association, Mr Theodore Bryant, of the firm of Bryant and May, said many of the girls wished to return to work, but were prevented by a system of picketing. About 160 girls had signed a paper expressing their desire to return to work if protection were afforded them. The firm desired that the girls should earn as good wages as possible. A meeting was held on Saturday morning, at the Mile-end waste, in connection with the strike at Bryant and May's. About 2,000 persons were present, but very few of the girls attended. The speakers included Messrs Graham, M.P., and Herbert Burroughs, Mrs Annie Besant and Miss Black, of the Woman's Protective League. Mrs Besant repeated her assertions previously made, and challenged Bryant and May to prosecute her for libel. She thought the threat to bring girls from Scotland to substitute for the strikers could be prevented by timely intervention. She was of opinion that everybody could do great good by not using the matches of the firm. Resolutions were adopted acknowledging the truth of Mrs Besant's statements, requesting the Home Secretary to receive a deputation of match girls, that a society should be formed amongst the girls, and that a fund should be promoted for their relief. There wa a strong muster of police present, but the crowd quickly dispersed.

THE MATCH GIRLS' STRIKE. The match girls' strike in east London shows signs of collapse. Many new hands are being taken on to replace the strikers. Charrington has granted the use of the Great Assembly Hall at Mile-End for 1,300 girls of Bryant and May on strike, for the registration of their names for employment.

The Graphic - Saturday 14 July 1888

Match Girls on Strike. According to Messrs. Bryant and May, the strike in their factories sprang wholly from "the influence of outside agitators." No doubt outside agitation had a good deal to do with the matter, but it would certainly not have been able to produce much effect if the match girls had been tolerably prosperous and contented. Messrs. Bryant and May admit that the average weekly wages paid to their adult female workers is only 11s. 2 d. Who can wonder that women paid at this rate for hard work should be in a mood to listen to "outside agitators," and to take the first favourable opportunity for improving their circumstances. The moral of the strike is that it is hopeless for women workers to try to better their position until they learn to combine in trade unions. As long as working men stood apart from one another they were practically at the mercy of their employers. Only when they formed powerful associations were they able to command in the labour markets something like reasonable terms. Unfortunately there are so many poor women willing to accept work on almost any conditions that it is hard for those of them who have employment to stand by one another, and to accept common sacrifices for the sake of a common ultimate benefit and we fear that many a day will pass before there are strong female trade unions. In the mean time, it is surely rather cruel on the part of "outside agitators" to stir up helpless girls to enter upon conflicts in which it is simply impossible for them td be victorious. We do not wish to question Mrs. Besant's motives, but she herself must have had some doubts as to the wisdom of the course she had adopted, when crowds of girls came to her, and she was obliged to say that it was not to be supposed she could keep 1,500 of them. Eleven shillings and twopence is wretched average weekly pay, but it is a good deal better than 0*s.* 0*d.*

THE HEROINES OF THE HOUR.

THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE MATCH-GIRLS OF BRYANT AND MAY.

The strike has ended happily, and the girls are reinstated under favourable renditions which are referred to in our first page. Meanwhile, we print the substance of two or three interviews which our representative had on Monday and Tuesday.

The girls are densely illiterate, and quite unable to state their affairs. I was, however, fortunate enough to meet with one young girl of seventeen, of some education, quite neatly dressed, and whose general appearance at first sight would have led one to assume that she was not so badly off as others of her class; but this I afterwards found was due to the absence of any attempt at flashiness of attire and a certain refinement of manner.

"Will you explain what you consider the actual cause of the turn-out?"

"Yes, and I will tell you nothing but the truth. We struck about two years back for the same reason that we are out for now. Some alterations were made in the works, and it became necessary that some of the girls should take their work when done upstairs. They complained at this. It caused them to lose time, and they couldn't earn so much money as previously. The manager of that department then took on a number of little girls who were ordered to take the work up the stairs when done, he shortly after deducted a penny from every shilling the girls earned in his department for the purpose, he stated, of paying the wages of the little girls. This went on for some time, and the girls didn't complain very much; but after a time the little girls were sent off, and the hands were again compelled to take their work upstairs themselves and lose the time about which they had bitterly complained previously, No notice was taken of the work-girls' demands that either the penny in each shilling should not be stopped, or that the little girls should be put on again, and so we held meetings among ourselves and decided to turn out. The firm wouldn't give way; we had no one to come and speak for us, and the end of it was that we were compelled to go in again or starve. Then things went on about the same as ever till the article in the paper appeared."

"What happened then?"

"Some of the girls were spoken to about the things mentioned in the *Link*. They were shown a paper and asked to sign it."

"What was the motive of this paper?"

"It was for the purpose of proving that all that Mrs. Besant had stated about the fines were lies. The girls said that it was all quite true, and that they would not sign the paper. Then we turned out, determined to try to get our rights if possible-either the penny from each shilling restored to us, or the little girls taken on again."

"Do you complain of anything else in the treatment you received while in the employment of Messrs. Bryant and May?"

"Yes, of the general fines. When I was earning only eightpence per day, if I arrived at the gates after twenty minutes to seven in the morning-my time being half-past six-I was fined fivepence, and would have to work all that day for the remaining threepence! This might go on for the whole of the week if I were ill. This was in the summer time. In winter I worked from eight in the morning till seven at night, one hour for dinner and no time for tea. If we were caught making tea, the fine would be-half-a-crown."

"More than half your earnings?"

"Yes. We were fined for all sorts of things. I was once fined sixpence for fetching a can of cold water to drink in the hot summer time. We were fined for singing or talking, leaving a few sprints about or dropping a few on the floor. Every month we were compelled to pay sixpence for a broom to keep the machines clean with; our canvas aprons we were compelled to purchase also. The portion of work I do is filling up the frames with sprints. To fill two frames, one on each machine, it takes about ten minutes; I received one shilling for one hundred frames. The most I ever earned was nine shillings, but since Easter I have never earned more than five shillings per week."

"Were you ever kept waiting for work?"

"Yes, frequently ; and we were always afraid to leave the place for fear of not getting any more work that day."

"Did you work the whole of the week previous to the strike?"

"Yes; I was there the whole of the week, but I lost time waiting for work, and took a little over three shillings that week. To prove this my informant produced a small paper bag, on which was printed the department in which she had worked, her number, and in pencil the sum she had received."

"Is the work in any way dangerous?"

"I have known several girls to get injured by having their fingers caught in the machines while attending to their work."

"Will you tell me bow you are living now?"

This young girl was not aware that I had seen and questioned her father before seeing her. The former was not present when I interviewed her, so that I was able to compare the two statements, and found that they did not vary in the slightest degree.

"Well, sir, mother makes match. boxes when she can get them, but for the last two weeks she has had no work on account of the strike."

"Your father?"

"Has earned one shilling only this week, and besides the little he can borrow from others, almost as poor as ourselves, that's all we have had to live on, and five of us in family."

"But surely your father cannot pay rent and keep you all on such a sum. What do you do?"

There were tears in this unfortunate young girl's eyes, and tears in her voice too, as she replied: "No, the rent is going back, and as to living, why, when we can get a bit of bread and butter we are very thankful for even that. and when we can't, we must go without."

THE MATCHGIRLS STRIKE.

The first meeting of the London Trades' Council since the matchgirls' strike was settled through the interposition of the Council was held yesterday, at the offices, Temple Chambers, Whitefriars-street, City. Mr. C.J. Drummond presided, and banded in from the Londem Society of Compositors £lO for the strike fund, with which the girls who ‘turned out will be finally paid at Charrington's Mile-end-road, this day. Mr. E. Coulson (gonend secretary Operative Bricklayers' Society) handed | in £lO from his organisation for the same object ; and the receipt of £5 from the Philanthropic Society of Coopers, and £2 2s. from the Cigar Makers' Mutual Association, were also acknowledged. Mr. George Shipton (secretary) brought up the report of the deputation from the Council which waited upon Mr. Bryaat (Bryant and May), the main poiuts in which have already been published. Several members of the Executive prowised to assist in the formation of the proposed Match Makers' Trade Union, which is to include the granting of sick, out of work, and other useful benefits to members,

MATCHMAKERS. The Matchmakers' Union, which was formed after the late Bryant and May's match girls' strike, has proved a steady success. Between boo and 700 of the girls have become members, and their payments are kept up with remarkable regularity. Two scales of contributions were fixed upon by the general meeting of the girls when the union was formed-2d. and 1d. a week. It says much for their determination that only two of their number have adopted the penny scale. The girls unanimously elected our comrades Annie Besant and Herbert Burrows as their honorary secretary and treasurer, but they have a committee of 12 of themselves, with a president, in whom all business power is vested. They have elected their secretary, treasurer, and two of their own number, to represent them at the forthcoming International Trades' Union Congress, and this in itself is a remarkable proof of the pace at which things social are moving. A year ago few would have prophesied that Bryant and May's matchgirls would take pact in such a gathering. The most cheering thing, however, about the whole movement, is the influence it is having on women's organisation generally. The Leeds women workers, as we pointed out last week, have formed a union—the outcome of their late strike—and the matchgirls have sent them a subscription. In Aberdeen also, we hear, the women weavers are organising, and it is not too much to hope that the Bryant and May strike may prove the germ of that national federation of women workers which will be one step towards their complete social emancipation.

The Commonweal v.4 1888

EAST-END MATCH MAKERS.-In the Link of June 23rd there was an article by Annie Besant, entitled "White Slavery in London," containing statements as to the amount of wages which Bryant and May, the match makers, pay to their workgirls. The statements were given by some of the girls, and three, on whom suspicion has fallen, have been discharged. Annie
Besant and Herbert Burrows pledged their word to the girls that if any of them were discharged in consequence of the statements made by them, their wages should be paid till they could find other work. The amount required is about eighteen shillings per week for the three, and we appeal to those of our readers who can afford to help to pay this sum to send any subscription, however small, to Annie Besant, 34, Bouverie Street, Fleet Street, E.C. She has till now received £1 from Mr. Conybeare, M.P., 10s. from another M.P., 10s. from a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and 5s. from Miss Mussell. A meeting of protest against Messrs. Bryant and May's action with regard to these poor girls will shortly be called in the East-end.

This branch of our work led to a big fight — a fight most happy in its results. At a meeting of the Fabian Society, Miss Clementina Black gave a capital lecture on Female Labour, and urged the formation of a Consumers' League, pledged only to buy from shops ceftiEcated " clean " from unfair wage. H. H. Champion, in the discussion that followed, drew attention to the wages paid by Bryant & May (Limited), while paying an enormous dividend to their shareholders, so that the value of the original ^5 shares was quoted at £i9 js. 6d. Herbert Burrows and I interviewed some of the girls, got lists of wages, of fines, &c. " A typical case is that of a girl of sixteen, a piece-worker ; she earns 4s. a week, and lives with a sister, employed by the same firm, who ' earns good money, as much as 8s. or 9s. a week.' Out of the earnings 2s. a week is paid for the rent of one room. The child lives only on bread and butter and tea, alike for breakfast and dinner, but related with dancing eyes that once a month she went to a meal where ' you get coffee and bread and butter, and jam and marmalade, and lots of it.'" We published the iacts under the title of " White Slavery in London," and called for a boycott of Bryant & May's matches. *' It is time some one came and helped us," said two pale-faced girls to me ; and I asked : " Who will help ? Plenty of people wish well to any good cause ; but very few care fo exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk anything in its support. ' Some one ought to do it, but why should I ? ' is the ever re-echoed phrase of weak-kneed amiability. ' Some one ought to do it, so why ml I ? ' is the cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly forward springing to face some perilous duty. Between those two sentences lie whole centuries of moral evolution,"

I was promptly threatened with an action for libel, but nothing came of it ; it was easier to strike at the girls, and a few days later Fleet Street was enlivened by the irruption of a crowd of match-girls, demanding Annie Besant, I couldn't speechify to match-girls in Fleet Street, so asked that a deputation should come and explain what they wanted. Up came three women and told their story : they had been asked to sign a paper certifying that they were well treated and contented, and that my statements were untrue ; they refiised. "You had spoke up for us," explained one, "and we weren't going back on you." A girl, pitched on as their leader, was threatened with dismissal ; she stood firm ; next day she was discharged for some trifle, and they all threw down their work, some 1,400 of them, and then a crowd of them started off to me to ask what to do next. If we ever worked in our

lives, Herbert Burrows and I worked for the next f night. And a pretty hubbub we created ; we asked I money, and it came pouring in ; we registered the g to receive strike pay, wrote articles, roused the clul held public meetings, got Mr. Bradlaugh to asK questions in Parliament, stirred up constituencies in which shareholders were members, till the whole country rang with the struggle. Mr. Frederick Charrington lent us a hall for registration, Mr. Sidney Webb and others moved the National Liberal Club to action ; we led a procession of the girls to the House of Commons, and interviewed, with a deputation of them. Members of Parliament who cross-questioned them. The girls behaved splendidly, stuck together, kept brave and bright all through. Mr. Hobart of the Social Democratic Federation, Messrs. Shaw, Bland, and Oliver, and Headlam of the Fabian Society, Miss Clementina Black, and many another helped in the heavy work. The London Trades Council finally consented to act as arbitrators and a satisfactory settlement was arrived at ; the girls went in to work, fines and deductions were abolished, better wages paid ; the Matchmakers' Union was established, still the strongest woman's Trades Union in England, and for years.J^ acted as secretary, till, under press of other duties^'U resigned, and my work was given by the girls to '. Thornton Smith ; Herbert Burrows became, and still^ the treasurer. For a time there was friction betwe^ the Company and the Union, but it gradually disappeared under the influence of conmion sense on both sides, and we have found the manager ready to conMder

any just grievance and to endeavour to remove it, while the Company have been liberal supporters of the Working Women's Club at Bow, founded by H. P. Blavatsky.

The worst suffering of all was among the boxmakers, thrown out of work by the strikcj and they were hard to reach. Twopence- farthing per gross of boxes, and buy your own string and paste, is not wealth, but when the work went more rapid starvation came. Oh, those trudges through the lanes and alleys round Bethnal Green Junction late at night, when our day's work was over ; children lying about on shavings, rags, anything ; famine looking out of baby faces, out of women's eyes, out of the tremulous hands of men. Heart grew sick and eyes dim, and ever louder sounded the question, "Where is the cure for sorrow, what the way of rescue for the world ? "

In August I asked for a *' match-girls' drawingroom." " It will want a piano, tables for papers, for games, for light literature ; so that it may offer a bright, homelike refuge to these girls, who now have no real homes, no playground save the streets. It is not proposed to build an ' institution ' with stern and rigid discipline and enforcement of prim behaviour, but to open a home, filled with the genial atmosphere of cordial comradeship, and self-respecting freedom — the atmosphere so familiar to all who have grown up in the blessed shelter of a happy home, so strange, alas ! to too many of our East London girls." In the same month of August, two years later, H. P. Blavatsky opened such a home.
