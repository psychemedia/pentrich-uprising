TABLEAUX VIVANTS AT SOUTH KENSINGTON.

 The Anglo-Danish Exhibition and Fete was formally opened yesterday. In a wooden theatre erected in the grounds it has been arranged to give daily a series of *tableaux vivants*, suggested by the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen; and Mr. Savile Clarke has undertaken to direct the performances. Of these the firs. was given last night before a specially invited company that included the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince Karl ofDenmark. The structure accommodates a thousand people, and although its holding capacity is not likely to be put to the test, there is no doubt but that this novel feature of the Exhibition will be popular, especially with children. Last night illustrations were given of five of Andersen's tales-"The Little Match-girl,;' "The Emperor's New Clothes," "Tommelise," "The Swineherd," and "The Marsh-King's Daughter,"' in which characters were represented by Misses Winning, Bowman, Thornton, and Messrs. Ettinson, Norton, and Little, supported by groups of courtiers, citizens, peasants, or fairies. Occasionally choruses were introduced to add to the poetical effect of the pictures. If these did not in all cases tell much of a story, they were unexceptionable on the score of beauty, and would have borne a longer inspection than the few seconds during which they remained visible.

Strike at Bryant and May's.

 There has been a strike at Messrs. Bryant and May's match factory. The facts, as stated by their manager, are, that on Wednesday morning one of the girls employed in cutting wood was required to manipulate her work in the manner desired. She refused to do so, and this being regarded as an act of insubordination she was discharged. In consequence, about 1,100 girls went out on strike. There was not work for the men and they had to go out also. Up to a late hour last night there was no sign of a compromise.

Nottingham Evening Post - Saturday 07 July 1888

 The Bryant and May strike may attract good deal of attention before the matter is ended. The millionare Bryants of this firm are Gladstonians, philanthropists, and social reformers. As a rule, Mr. Stead, of the *Pall Mall Gazette*, may be taken as a prophet of their particular section of the community. The *Pall Mall*, however, seems to have raised a hornet's nest about the heads of Messrs. Bryant and May which has ended in a strike. Conflicting stories are in circulation as the cause. The *Pall Mall* asseverates that the strike in question is to be attributed to the discharge of some girls who were alleged to have made revelations to some of the Social Reform people who in other matters act with the heads of the firm. At the present moment feeling is running very high the subject in the East End.

Echo (London) - Saturday 07 July 1888

THE MATCHGIRLS' STRIKE. WORK NOT RESUMED.

 Several of the girls mow out en strike at Bryant and May’s applied this morning to be allowed to resume work, but were told that the factory would not resume work to-day. So vast are the resources of the establishment, so large is the stock already manufactured, that it is stated not a single order would be delayed if the hands did not enter the factory for another month to come. The agitation has not only affected the girls, but a larger number of boys and sowe of the men have necessarily been thrown out of employment by the stoppage of one department. Fairfield-road, where the works are situate, is a turning out of the Mile-end-road, and faces a police-station. At the corner of Fairfield-road there assembled shortly before mine o’clock a little knot of girls and boys, the former bearing an unmistakable factory appearance. They discussed among themselves the probabilities of the future, whether they should er should not "go in" on Monday, and the very necessary query was also put one to the other, "Who's going to keep us while we're out." No decision, was, however, come to.

HARANGUED BY SOCIALISTS.

 Then the girls—about fifty in all—sallied off to a rendezvous outside the Great Assembly Hall, Mile-end-road, where it was said a meeting was to be held. Here a miscellaneous group gathered round three Socialists, woo, in consequence of the noise of the traffic continually passing the stone thoroughfare, were unable to make themselves heard save to & small group of admiring boys crowding round the only platform—a chair. The harangues were of the most violent character, while certain specially choice epithets were reserved for the firm whose "delinquencies" were being discussed. In order to get an impartial history of the strike, our representative made an exhaustive inquiry, not only of the girls and boys who were employed at the factory, but also of one of the directors—comfortably ensconced in the office of Bryant and May. 

THE GRIEVANCES OF THE GIRLS.

 The girls had many grievances to relate. The stories told by one were not always confirmed by a sister worker, an inclination to exaggeration being manifest. On one theme they were more unanimous?that had reference to the assertion that a system of fines exists to the prejudice of the workers. ??So much is deducted for the use of the machines?that is, those who are on piece ?? remarked one girl, with an enormous feather in her hat and an untidy Piccadilly fringe nearly covering a naturally low forehead. ??Then we are fined 1d. for broken match boxes, which we can?t help sometimes ? ; *? And if they catches alight,? interposed another worker, with an intelligent Jewish-typed face,'?we're fined 6d.? Then she added, * Two of us girls got the * sack? because we left some matches on the bernch.? THE ?? PHOSSY JAW '? EXPLAINED, ~ ?Tell him, Liz, about them as has the ? phossy jaw,? "? interpesed a dark little chap, presumably a brotker. Though by no means diffident, the little Jewish beauty showed an evident reluctance {o explain what & ? phossy jaw?? meant. *?lt?s just this, Sir,? remarked a lad with an abnormally pale face?no East-end boy could have - exhibited & countenance more deathlike. **Once you has a phossy jaw ?on never gets over it. The jaw arter a bit drops right out, and???(the sentence was completed by a match-making wit standing by)?'? the chap as has it goes to Mile-end Cemetery.? **Well, you see what this phossy jaw is.?? Onr reporter nodded. ** It comes from a smellin? the phosphorus as it biles. Supposing you has the toothache, and the tooth is a bit holler. Well, the phosphorus gets in, and by-and-bye, you has a place about the size of this,? and the lad roughly indicated, by his hands, making gyrations around his head, a swelling about the dimensions of a half-pint measure; *? That's what we calls a phossy jaw. As soon as a chap or & gal gets that they has to go home.? 

BOY-DIPPER EARNING 11s. 6d. A WEEK.

One lad, when cross-examined, admitted that his wages were 11s. 6d. a week—the boy was about 14 years of age. "But them I'm a dipper, and dippers get more'n the ether hands. The men dippers get 21s. a week." The girls declared they were fined for various reasons—for breaking match-boxes when putting them in the machine; fer burnt matches (this mishap, some of the workpeople declared, could not be avoided, as they would light spontaneously before being finally dipped); for going into parts of the factory where they were not employed (especially where male members of the stall were engaged), and for other reasons.

THE OTHER SIDE.

Thinking it only fair to "hear the other side," our representative called at Messrs. Bryant and May’s factory, where he was courteously received by one of the directors of that limited company. That gentleman, who said he did not desire the publicity of his name, gave his assurance that nearly all the statements hitherto publicly made were grossly exaggerated, and many of them utterly devoid of truth. When the first sign of disaffection was manifested, some of the girls had an interview with the manager, and when questioned as to what their grievance was they

COULD NOT SAY

of what they had to complain. The alteration in the scale of wages commenced two years ago. Special machinery was then introduced, and what was then done by one person is new done by two, owing to the sub-division of labour necessary to carry out the detailed work necessitated by the adoption of mechanical means. Before the altered scale, the average rate for filling the boxes was 3d. a "duck"—a tecnmical term well known in the factory—but when the machines came in operation the price was reduced to 2 3/4 d. a ““duck.” (A duck is a tray for containing the boxes after they are filled.)

THE PAY—11s. A WEEK.

“But this reduction," explained the director, "was really for the benefit of the workpeople. They got less per 'duck,' but the increased facilities enabled them to do mere work in a given time. Our wages' book will show that our people are paid far more than is the case elsewhere. The average pay per head—taking the girls and the boys—is 11s. a week. The 'frames' now are filled automatically. The girls have merely to watch the machines."

THE STATUE—~THE DIRECTOR’S DENIAL.

Explaining the "bronze statue affair," the directer said there was not a word of truth in the assertion that it was paid out of the fines of the workpeople. He added, "Mr. Theodore Bryant, who instituted that statue, has net been connected with this company for six years at least." As to the fines, our representative was assured that they were only such as were of necessity imposed in large establishments where discipline was essential.

"DISPUTE BY NO MEANS GENERAL."

The dispute, he concluded, was by no means of a general character, and had evidently—so he remarked—"Been got up outside by one or two insignificant agitators whose time might be better employed." He added that the whole agitation was a cruel business for the workpeople, as a large number had been thrown out of employment by the action of a few.

By the way, it is worth noting that the directors declared that instances of "phossy jaw" were now very rare, amd were nearly always attributable to want of cleanliness on the part of the workpeople.

A meeting to protest against Bryant and May's treatment of their match-girls will be held on Mile-end Waste on Sunday morning, at 11.30, to be addressed by Annie Besant, Rev. Stewart Headlam, and Herbert Burrows.

THE STRIKE BRYANT & MAY'S.

 This morning 160 girls, employed at wax vesta making at Bryant & May's, returned to work, and measures have been taken protect them. The girls on strike assembled near the works this morning, and marched to Mile End Waste, where they were addressed by Socialists and others. They then proceeded in a body to the Thames Embankment. where they were to be met by members of Parliament, and present a petition to the Home Secretary.

THE STRIKE AT BRYANT AND MAY'S.

 In an interview with correspondent of the Press Association, Mr Theodore Bryant, of the firm of Bryant and May, said many of the girls wished to return to work, but were prevented by a system of picketing. About 160 girls had signed a paper expressing their desire to return to work if protection were afforded them. The firm desired that the girls should earn as good wages as possible. A meeting was held on Saturday morning, at the Mile-end waste, in connection with the strike at Bryant and May's. About 2,000 persons were present, but very few of the girls attended. The speakers included Messrs Graham, M.P., and Herbert Burroughs, Mrs Annie Besant and Miss Black, of the Woman's Protective League. Mrs Besant repeated her assertions previously made, and challenged Bryant and May to prosecute her for libel. She thought the threat to bring girls from Scotland to substitute for the strikers could be prevented by timely intervention. She was of opinion that everybody could do great good by not using the matches of the firm. Resolutions were adopted acknowledging the truth of Mrs Besant's statements, requesting the Home Secretary to receive a deputation of match girls, that a society should be formed amongst the girls, and that a fund should be promoted for their relief. There wa a strong muster of police present, but the crowd quickly dispersed.

 THE MATCH GIRLS' STRIKE. The match girls' strike in east London shows signs of collapse. Many new hands are being taken on to replace the strikers. Charrington has granted the use of the Great Assembly Hall at Mile-End for 1,300 girls of Bryant and May on strike, for the registration of their names for employment.

The Graphic - Saturday 14 July 1888

 Match Girls on Strike. According to Messrs. Bryant and May, the strike in their factories sprang wholly from "the influence of outside agitators." No doubt outside agitation had a good deal to do with the matter, but it would certainly not have been able to produce much effect if the match girls had been tolerably prosperous and contented. Messrs. Bryant and May admit that the average weekly wages paid to their adult female workers is only 11s. 2 d. Who can wonder that women paid at this rate for hard work should be in a mood to listen to "outside agitators," and to take the first favourable opportunity for improving their circumstances. The moral of the strike is that it is hopeless for women workers to try to better their position until they learn to combine in trade unions. As long as working men stood apart from one another they were practically at the mercy of their employers. Only when they formed powerful associations were they able to command in the labour markets something like reasonable terms. Unfortunately there are so many poor women willing to accept work on almost any conditions that it is hard for those of them who have employment to stand by one another, and to accept common sacrifices for the sake of a common ultimate benefit and we fear that many a day will pass before there are strong female trade unions. In the mean time, it is surely rather cruel on the part of "outside agitators" to stir up helpless girls to enter upon conflicts in which it is simply impossible for them td be victorious. We do not wish to question Mrs. Besant's motives, but she herself must have had some doubts as to the wisdom of the course she had adopted, when crowds of girls came to her, and she was obliged to say that it was not to be supposed she could keep 1,500 of them. Eleven shillings and twopence is wretched average weekly pay, but it is a good deal better than 0*s.* 0*d.*

TO DO

THE HEROINES OF THE HOUR.

THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE MATCH-GIRLS OF BRYANT AND MAY.

The strike has ended happily, and the girls are reinstated under favourable renditions which are referred to in our first page. Meanwhile, we print the substance of two or three interviews which our representative had on Monday and Tuesday.

The girls are densely illiterate, and quite unable to state their affairs. I was, however, fortunate enough to meet with one young girl of seventeen, of some education, quite neatly dressed, and whose general appearance at first sight would have led one to assume that she was not so badly off as others of her class; but this I afterwards found was due to the absence of any attempt at flashiness of attire and a certain refinement of manner.

"Will you explain what you consider the actual cause of the turn-out?"

"Yes, and I will tell you nothing but the truth. We struck about two years back for the same reason that we are out for now. Some alterations were made in the works, and it became necessary that some of the girls should take their work when done upstairs. They complained at this. It caused them to lose time, and they couldn't earn so much money as previously. The manager of that department then took on a number of little girls who were ordered to take the work up the stairs when done, he shortly after deducted a penny from every shilling the girls earned in his department for the purpose, he stated, of paying the wages of the little girls. This went on for some time, and the girls didn't complain very much; but after a time the little girls were sent off, and the hands were again compelled to take their work upstairs themselves and lose the time about which they had bitterly complained previously, No notice was taken of the work-girls' demands that either the penny in each shilling should not be stopped, or that the little girls should be put on again, and so we held meetings among ourselves and decided to turn out. The firm wouldn't give way; we had no one to come and speak for us, and the end of it was that we were compelled to go in again or starve. Then things went on about the same as ever till the article in the paper appeared."

"What happened then?"

"Some of the girls were spoken to about the things mentioned in the *Link*. They were shown a paper and asked to sign it."

"What was the motive of this paper?"

"It was for the purpose of proving that all that Mrs. Besant had stated about the fines were lies. The girls said that it was all quite true, and that they would not sign the paper. Then we turned out, determined to try to get our rights if possible-either the penny from each shilling restored to us, or the little girls taken on again."

"Do you complain of anything else in the treatment you received while in the employment of Messrs. Bryant and May?"

"Yes, of the general fines. When I was earning only eightpence per day, if I arrived at the gates after twenty minutes to seven in the morning-my time being half-past six-I was fined fivepence, and would have to work all that day for the remaining threepence! This might go on for the whole of the week if I were ill. This was in the summer time. In winter I worked from eight in the morning till seven at night, one hour for dinner and no time for tea. If we were caught making tea, the fine would be-half-a-crown."

"More than half your earnings?"

"Yes. We were fined for all sorts of things. I was once fined sixpence for fetching a can of cold water to drink in the hot summer time. We were fined for singing or talking, leaving a few sprints about or dropping a few on the floor. Every month we were compelled to pay sixpence for a broom to keep the machines clean with; our canvas aprons we were compelled to purchase also. The portion of work I do is filling up the frames with sprints. To fill two frames, one on each machine, it takes about ten minutes; I received one shilling for one hundred frames. The most I ever earned was nine shillings, but since Easter I have never earned more than five shillings per week."

"Were you ever kept waiting for work?"

"Yes, frequently ; and we were always afraid to leave the place for fear of not getting any more work that day."

"Did you work the whole of the week previous to the strike?"

"Yes; I was there the whole of the week, but I lost time waiting for work, and took a little over three shillings that week. To prove this my informant produced a small paper bag, on which was printed the department in which she had worked, her number, and in pencil the sum she had received."

"Is the work in any way dangerous?"

"I have known several girls to get injured by having their fingers caught in the machines while attending to their work."

"Will you tell me bow you are living now?"

This young girl was not aware that I had seen and questioned her father before seeing her. The former was not present when I interviewed her, so that I was able to compare the two statements, and found that they did not vary in the slightest degree.

"Well, sir, mother makes match. boxes when she can get them, but for the last two weeks she has had no work on account of the strike."

"Your father?"

"Has earned one shilling only this week, and besides the little he can borrow from others, almost as poor as ourselves, that's all we have had to live on, and five of us in family."

"But surely your father cannot pay rent and keep you all on such a sum. What do you do?"

There were tears in this unfortunate young girl's eyes, and tears in her voice too, as she replied: "No, the rent is going back, and as to living, why, when we can get a bit of bread and butter we are very thankful for even that. and when we can't, we must go without."

THE MATCHGIRLS STRIKE.

 The first meeting of the London Trades' Council since the matchgirls' strike was settled through the interposition of the Council was held yesterday, at the offices, Temple Chambers, Whitefriars-street, City. Mr. C.J. Drummond presided, and banded in from the London Society of Compositors £lO for the strike fund, with which the girls who ‘turned out will be finally paid at Charrington's Mile-end-road, this day. Mr. E. Coulson (general secretary Operative Bricklayers' Society) handed in £10 from his organisation for the same object; and the receipt of £5 from the Philanthropic Society of Coopers, and £2 2s. from the Cigar Makers' Mutual Association, were also acknowledged. Mr. George Shipton (secretary) brought up the report of the deputation from the Council which waited upon Mr. Bryant (Bryant and May), the main points in which have already been published. Several members of the Executive promised to assist in the formation of the proposed Match Makers' Trade Union, which is to include the granting of sick, out of work, and other useful benefits to members.

Justice - Saturday 13 October 1888

 MATCHMAKERS. The Matchmakers' Union, which was formed after the late Bryant and May's match girls' strike, has proved a steady success. Between boo and 700 of the girls have become members, and their payments are kept up with remarkable regularity. Two scales of contributions were fixed upon by the general meeting of the girls when the union was formed-2d. and 1d. a week. It says much for their determination that only two of their number have adopted the penny scale. The girls unanimously elected our comrades Annie Besant and Herbert Burrows as their honorary secretary and treasurer, but they have a committee of 12 of themselves, with a president, in whom all business power is vested. They have elected their secretary, treasurer, and two of their own number, to represent them at the forthcoming International Trades' Union Congress, and this in itself is a remarkable proof of the pace at which things social are moving. A year ago few would have prophesied that Bryant and May's matchgirls would take pact in such a gathering. The most cheering thing, however, about the whole movement, is the influence it is having on women's organisation generally. The Leeds women workers, as we pointed out last week, have formed a union—the outcome of their late strike—and the matchgirls have sent them a subscription. In Aberdeen also, we hear, the women weavers are organising, and it is not too much to hope that the Bryant and May strike may prove the germ of that national federation of women workers which will be one step towards their complete social emancipation.

The Commonweal v.4 1888

 EAST-END MATCH MAKERS.-In the Link of June 23rd there was an article by Annie Besant, entitled "White Slavery in London," containing statements as to the amount of wages which Bryant and May, the match makers, pay to their workgirls. The statements were given by some of the girls, and three, on whom suspicion has fallen, have been discharged. Annie Besant and Herbert Burrows pledged their word to the girls that if any of them were discharged in consequence of the statements made by them, their wages should be paid till they could find other work. The amount required is about eighteen shillings per week for the three, and we appeal to those of our readers who can afford to help to pay this sum to send any subscription, however small, to Annie Besant, 34, Bouverie Street, Fleet Street, E.C. She has till now received £1 from Mr. Conybeare, M.P., 10s. from another M.P., 10s. from a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and 5s. from Miss Mussell. A meeting of protest against Messrs. Bryant and May's action with regard to these poor girls will shortly be called in the East-end.

 This branch of our work led to a big fight — a fight most happy in its results. At a meeting of the Fabian Society, Miss Clementina Black gave a capital lecture on Female Labour, and urged the formation of a Consumers' League, pledged only to buy from shops certificated "clean" from unfair wage. H. H. Champion, in the discussion that followed, drew attention to the wages paid by Bryant & May (Limited), while paying an enormous dividend to their shareholders, so that the value of the original ^5 shares was quoted at £i9 js. 6d. Herbert Burrows and I interviewed some of the girls, got lists of wages, of fines, &c. " A typical case is that of a girl of sixteen, a piece-worker; she earns 4s. a week, and lives with a sister, employed by the same firm, who 'earns good money, as much as 8s. or 9s. a week.' Out of the earnings 2s. a week is paid for the rent of one room. The child lives only on bread and butter and tea, alike for breakfast and dinner, but related with dancing eyes that once a month she went to a meal where 'you get coffee and bread and butter, and jam and marmalade, and lots of it.'" We published the facts under the title of "White Slavery in London," and called for a boycott of Bryant & May's matches. "It is time some one came and helped us," said two pale-faced girls to me; and I asked: "Who will help? Plenty of people wish well to any good cause; but very few care to exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk anything in its support. 'Some one ought to do it, but why should I?' is the ever re-echoed phrase of weak-kneed amiability. 'Some one ought to do it, so why not I?' is the cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly forward springing to face some perilous duty. Between those two sentences lie whole centuries of moral evolution,"

 I was promptly threatened with an action for libel, but nothing came of it ; it was easier to strike at the girls, and a few days later Fleet Street was enlivened by the irruption of a crowd of match-girls, demanding Annie Besant, I couldn't speechify to match-girls in Fleet Street, so asked that a deputation should come and explain what they wanted. Up came three women and told their story : they had been asked to sign a paper certifying that they were well treated and contented, and that my statements were untrue; they refused. "You had spoke up for us," explained one, "and we weren't going back on you." A girl, pitched on as their leader, was threatened with dismissal; she stood firm; next day she was discharged for some trifle, and they all threw down their work, some 1,400 of them, and then a crowd of them started off to me to ask what to do next. If we ever worked in our lives, Herbert Burrows and I worked for the next f night. And a pretty hubbub we created ; we asked I money, and it came pouring in ; we registered the g to receive strike pay, wrote articles, roused the clul held public meetings, got Mr. Bradlaugh to asK questions in Parliament, stirred up constituencies in which shareholders were members, till the whole country rang with the struggle. Mr. Frederick Charrington lent us a hall for registration, Mr. Sidney Webb and others moved the National Liberal Club to action ; we led a procession of the girls to the House of Commons, and interviewed, with a deputation of them. Members of Parliament who cross-questioned them. The girls behaved splendidly, stuck together, kept brave and bright all through. Mr. Hobart of the Social Democratic Federation, Messrs. Shaw, Bland, and Oliver, and Headlam of the Fabian Society, Miss Clementina Black, and many another helped in the heavy work. The London Trades Council finally consented to act as arbitrators and a satisfactory settlement was arrived at ; the girls went in to work, fines and deductions were abolished, better wages paid ; the Matchmakers' Union was established, still the strongest woman's Trades Union in England, and for years.J^ acted as secretary, till, under press of other duties^'U resigned, and my work was given by the girls to '. Thornton Smith; Herbert Burrows became, and still^ the treasurer. For a time there was friction between the Company and the Union, but it gradually disappeared under the influence of common sense on both sides, and we have found the manager ready to consider

 any just grievance and to endeavour to remove it, while the Company have been liberal supporters of the Working Women's Club at Bow, founded by H. P. Blavatsky.

 The worst suffering of all was among the boxmakers, thrown out of work by the strikers and they were hard to reach. Twopence- farthing per gross of boxes, and buy your own string and paste, is not wealth, but when the work went more rapid starvation came. Oh, those trudges through the lanes and alleys round Bethnal Green Junction late at night, when our day's work was over ; children lying about on shavings, rags, anything ; famine looking out of baby faces, out of women's eyes, out of the tremulous hands of men. Heart grew sick and eyes dim, and ever louder sounded the question, "Where is the cure for sorrow, what the way of rescue for the world?"

 In August I asked for a "match-girls' drawingroom." "It will want a piano, tables for papers, for games, for light literature; so that it may offer a bright, homelike refuge to these girls, who now have no real homes, no playground save the streets. It is not proposed to build an 'institution' with stern and rigid discipline and enforcement of prim behaviour, but to open a home, filled with the genial atmosphere of cordial comradeship, and self-respecting freedom — the atmosphere so familiar to all who have grown up in the blessed shelter of a happy home, so strange, alas! to too many of our East London girls." In the same month of August, two years later, H. P. Blavatsky opened such a home.

MATCHMAKERS' UNION.

A large meeting of the members of the Matchmakers’ Union was held at the Women's Club, Bow-road. The meeting bad been summoned for the special purpose of hearing an address on "Phossy Jaw" from Mr. J. Murray Macdonald, M.P. for Bow, who has lately been moving very actively in the way of attempted prevention of this peculiar form of disease. The chair was taken by Mr. Herbert Burrows, treasurer of the union. Mr. Macdonald, who was heartily received, gave a very interesting and practical address on the efforts which have lately been made to minimise the evils of "phossy jaw" among the workers in the match girls, and went carefully through the Home Secretary’s recent rules with the match-girls in order to see whether they were adequate or whether they needed amendment, He elicited the information that the issue of the rules has resulted in the conditions being considerably improved by the employers, and he stated that Mr. Asquith was, he believed, thoroughly in earnest in his wish to stop the evils arising from the use of poisonous phosphorus. A large number of people were prepared to press for the taking over of match factories by the Government if the disease could not be stopped in any other way, as had been done abroad. That, however, was a long way off, and both Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Burrows pressed upon those present the duty of doing all they could to help to carry ont the existing roles, as they could not expect the Home Secretary to make more stringent rules till he was thoroughly satisfied that the present regulations were defective through no one’s fault. Mr. Burrows, as treasurer, reported to the union a substantial balance of £500, which is mostly invested in consols.

ONE more quotation and we have done with sermons. The last clerical utterance we wish to direct attention to is that by Canon Wilberforce at St. John's, Westminster. In a remarkable address he said "He who led his own selfish life, who cared not for the brother who was sweated to death or poisoned by the noxious air in which he worked; he who was content that the match-girl should be half-starved and die of the agonies of 'phossy jaw'  whilst the company cynically distributed 28 per cent.; he who in his lifetime amassed several millions, whilst his employees could scarcely make both ends meet, and could make no provision for old age; he who had no thought for the thousands who lived wretched, joyless lives, was guiltily acquiescing in the causes that made for the misery of the many. An answer would be demanded here or at the Day of Judgment, 'Where is thy brother?'"

EAST LONDON MATCH-GIRLS.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE STANDARD

 Sir, — Allow me to corroborate Mr. Hare's account of the workpeople, and especially the girls and women, employed by Messrs. Bryant and May. A few years ago the question of "phossy jaw" was agitated in the papers, and I made some investigations into the subject. visiting Messrs. Bryant and May's among other places. I found the condition of the workwomen exactly what Mr. Hare describes. The match-girls are the very pick of the East-end workers, envied by others on account of the good wages they earn, and much in request by the young men. I saw them at work, and entered into conversation with some of them. I can only say that I never saw workpeople so happy and contented, or — for East-enders— so healthy. They deprecated the interference of agitators, and said they were very well if people would only let them alone. At the same time, their standard of comfort and health is not very high, and I sympathise with any efforts to raise it. I came to the conclusion, as the result of my inquiries, that phosphorus poisoning is very rare, and, when it occurs, it is almost always due to the slovenly and careless conduct of the sufferer.
 
 I need hardly say I have no connection with Messrs, Bryant and May, or with any other employer.
 
 I am, Sir, your obedient servant,  
July 14. M.8., M.R.C.P.

Leeds Mercury - Friday 22 July 1898

The Home Secretary does not think is a case for prohibiting the use of yellow phosphorous in making matches has been made out. Such, in effect, is his reply to an influential deputation, chiefly composed of ladies, introduced to him yesterday at the Home Office by Mr. Burdett-Coutts, MP. Why the ladies were so numerous was because the health of a body of their of their working sisters was at stake. The necessity for intervention in their defence is pressing, and is hardly open to contention. The fact, mentioned by Mr. Burdett-Coutts, that in one large and well known manufactory alone there had, since 1893, been seventeen cases of phosphorus poisoning, six of which had resulted in a horrible death, needs no comment to give it force. How many of the poor sufferers endure the disease in silence can only be conjectured, for leading manufacturers have hushed up cases of what is known as "phossy-jaw" whenever it was possible to do so. Hence the inspectors have often been baffled in their efforts to save the match-girl from a horrible death. The ascertained facts of the deadly dangers which attend ordinary match-making justified the deputation in asking that some conditions or regulations of the manufacture should be devised which should make impossible this fearful disease among the women and girls employed. The investigations which had been held made three things clear, said Mr. Burdett-Coutts—"First, that there was used in the manufacture of non-safety, or 'strike-anywhere' matches, the white or yellow phosphorous, the fumes of which were poisonous, as contrasted with the red phosphorus, which is non-poisonous. Secondly, that the regulations for inspection, or the conditions under which inspection was made, had been proved to be such that they could be readily evaded and defied. Thirdly, that if the offenders were discovered in such violation of the rules and convicted, the penalty of £20 was utterly insufficient, and probably no penalty that legislation could inflict would be sufficient to deter a great and rich firm from pursuing their trade in a manner which would make the largest dividends." These considerations fortified the deputation in asking for the the total abolition of the use of yellow phosphorous in the making of matches and the forbidding of the importation of phosphorus matches into this country. The suggestion made by Baroness Burdett-Coutts and Lady Portsmouth that women inspectors should be appointed to watchover the welfare of the match-girl is an excellent one, which found favour with Sir Matthew White Ridley— almost the only one that did. At present he is awaiting reports on the conditions of match-making at home and abroad, before forming a final opinion on the subject. So far as the inquiry has gone, the Home Secretary’s remarks support the inference that he regards the evil caused by the use of yellow phosphorus as due in large measure to defective structural conditions of the factory, instancing America, where in the case of many factories "phossy-jaw" is unknown. Sir Matthew White Ridley shrank from entertaining the idea of a total prohibition of yellow phosphorous, for he conjured up Parliamentary difficulties, the ruin of match-making firms, and the throwing of many workpeople out of employment, as a result of what he regarded as a very strong measure. As preventive measures, the Home Secretary laid stress upon better ventilation of factories and periodical examination of the teeth of the work-people. He attempted to soften his refusal of the request for total prohibition by informing the deputation that he hoped to be in a position soon to frame a special rule which would make the use of yellow phosphorous innocuous. With this somewhat vague statement the deputation must be content for the present.
