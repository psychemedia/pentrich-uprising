THE CATO STREET CONSPIRACY (1820).

On the accession of George the Fourth to the throne, January 29th, 1820, Lord Harrowby, President of the Privy Council, issued invitations to the cabinet ministers to dine with him on February 23rd, according to prescribed custom, at his house, No. 39, Grosvenor Square. The death and funeral of the old king in January had, it may be mentioned, led to the suspension of cabinet dinners. The following well-known persons were the guests invited: the Earl of Liverpool, Lord Chancellor Eldon, Mr. Vansittart, Earl Bathurst, Lord Castlereagh,Lord Sidmouth, the Earl of Westmoreland, Lord Melville, the Duke of Wellington, Mr. Canning, Mr, Robinson, Mr. Bathurst, Mr. Wellesley Pole, and the Earl of Mulgrave.

The year 1819 had been a troublous one. The dissipation and reckless extravagance of the Bogent, the dearness of bread, the oppressive taxation, the Spafields riots, and, lastly, the unnecessary brutality of the Lancashire yeomen and the soldiers at tho Peterloo meeting, had combined to irritate the poorer people and render them disaffected to tho Government. Reform and education had become subjects of discussion with all enlightened men ; the desperate and the fanatical brooded over revolution, conspiracy, and violence.

Spies had been at work fomenting and urging forward plots, and the ministers, for many weeks, had had inklings of some impending danger. There had been apprehensions of ^ rising on the night of the old king^s funeral, but the conspirators, it was ascertained, had then altered their plans and projected a more cruel and wholesale massacre, urged on by the Government spies, who had pretended to enlist themselves in their cause only the sooner to drag them to the scaffold.

The day before the cabinet dinner, as Lord Harrowby was riding in the Park, alone, and preparatory to attending a council at Carlton Palace, a bankrupt milkman, named Hiden, approached him at Grosvenor Gate, and handed him a letter directed to Lord Castlereagh — a letter which, he said, was of considerable importance to both their lordships. The man wishing a second interview, Lord Harrowby met him next morning by appointment among the young plantations in the ring at Hyde Park.

Hiden then revealed the plots of a knot of conspirators who held meetings in a loft over a stable in Cato Street (now Homer Street), Edgware Road, their leader a gambler named Thistlewood, who had been formerly in the marines, and afterwards a subaltern in a West India regiment. Their plan was to seize two pieces of cannon that were in Gray's Inn Lane, at the stables of the City Light Horse Volunteers, and six pieces from the Finsbury Artillery Ground, to take the Bank of England, sot fire to New Furnivars Inn, the Portman Street barracks, and also buildings in other parts of London, to destroy the telegraph to Woolwich, and, establishing a provisional government at the Mansion House, to send emissaries to Dover, Brighton, Ramsgate, and Margate, to prevent obnoxious persons escaping.

But the preliminary blow contemplated by these ferocious assassins was even more terrible.

Four and twenty men, armed with pistols, sabres, knives, pikes, hand-grenades, and blunderbusses, were to proceed to Lord Harrowby's house when the company was assembled. Thistlewood was to knock at the door, and hand a letter to the footman. Directly the door opened, the band would rush in and seize the servants, threatening them with instant death if they resisted or gave the alarm. The stairs were next to be seized and guarded by men with lire-arms and grenades. If any one attempted to escape from above or below, handgrenades were to be dashed in among them. Two men were also to be placed at the same time at the area, and, armed with grenades and blunderbusses, to stop all fugitives with showers of shot and fire. Two swordsmen (old soldiers), told off for the higher class of murder, followed by the rest, wore then to nisli into the dining-room and kill every one — the bad for their oppression, the good for keeping such evil company. Ings, a pork-butcher, the most savage of the crow, was going to arm himself with a brace of pistols, a cutlass, and a specially prepared knife of great strength, weight, and keenness, and, cutting off the heads of Lord Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth, carry them off (for some un

defined purpose) in two bags bought for the horrible occasion. Ings's cry, as they tore into Lord Harrowby^s dining-room, was to be —

Well, my lords, I have'got as good men here as the Manchester yeomanry. Citizens, do your duty."

These words are significant. The citizens evidently meant to renew the horrors of the French Kevolution, Mieving the popular disaffection to be general ; and the allusion io Peterloo showed how deeply the cruelties of that day had struck into the hearts of the poorer classes.

In the mean time, other persons besides Hiden had betrayed the conspirators. Dwyer, an Irish bricklayer, whoVad been employed to muster his countrymen, and to carry off the firearms from the Foundling, had informed ,*he Secretary of State by means of a Major James. An infamous informer, named Edwards, a modeller and image-seller at Windsor, had also spoken to a gentleman of the king's household.

Lord Ilarrowby was wary, and did nothing to scare the assassins. The dinner was secretly put off, but not publicly or in the newspapers,^ The Archbishop of York, who lived next door, having a dinner the same day and hour, the carriages arriving at that house deceived the watchers whom Thistlewood liad placed for the whole day and night before in the square, and no alarm was excited in the minds of the 'gang.

On the afternoon of the 23 rd, Lord Ilarrowby, sending word to bis brother ministers, took refuge in Lord Liverpool's house, nor did he write to his servants to countermand the dinner till eight o'clock in the evening. At nine, Thistlewood and his men were to enter Grosvenor Square.

At the time of the conspiracy, Thistlewood lived in a twopair front room in Stanhope Street, Clare Market, and had tong before his last fatal plot been tried for treasonable practices and acquitted, but afterwards, on a charge of abetting Dr. Watson's son in the Spafields riot, had been imprisoned in Horsham jail. While there, he had been foolish enough to send a challenge to Lord Sidmouth. There can be no doubt that he was a rancorous, savage-tempered, malignant man, capable of any crime to effect certain undefined political changes. Thistlewood had resolved to have the meetings at his own house ; but there happened to be a Bow Street officer living opposite, and he was afraid of the committees being discovered. Brunt, bis savage lieutenant and secretary, was a boot-closer of the humblest kind, who rented two miserable rooms for bis wife, child, and apprentice in Fox Court, Gray's Inn Lane. The treasonable meetings were hold in a room in

the same house in which the prisoner lugs, the pork-butcher, also residerl. Davidson, a third conspirator, a man of colour^ was a cabinet-maker. Adams (the informer) and Harrison, one of the selected swordsmen," had both been soldiers in the Life Guards. These men had frequently met in a back room in the yard of the White Hart public-house, Brook's Market, where they had been observed by Bow Street officers. The depot for powder and arms was at the house of a conspirator named Tidd, who lived in the Hole-in-the-Wall Passage, near Brook's Market. Harrison, while the plot was still ripening* had rented a stable in Cato Street, Edgware Koad. This ob4ure street lies between John Street on the east, and Queen Street on the west.

The stable beloiig(^ to General Watson, then abroad, and a month or two beftre had been used as a cow-shod by a milkman named Firth. It is the first building on the right as you enter from John Street. Nearly opposite Cato Street was a public-house called the Horse and Groom, where the conspirators assembled to drink and discuss preliminaries. The street in which the deserted stable stood was accessible from John Street by an archway, and opened into Queen Street by a path guarded by posts for foot passengers only. The stable had three stalls and a cart-shed. Nearly opposite the door was a stet^ladder leading to a hayloft, and opening from this loft, which had, wo believe, been used as a carpenter's shop, were two small rooms over the cart-house. The loft had two windows, one looking on the street, and this was kept covered with canvas, to prevent any one seeing in. The door of the li ay loft, looking into the street, was kept strongly barred. In the floor of the loft were two long apertures for hay, which opened on the racks in the stable below.

About three o'clock on the afternoon of the 23rd of February, 1820, a mail living at No. 3, Cato Street, observed Harrison, the soldier, at work cleaning the stable, and about half-past four, when he returned from work, the same man saw Davidson pacing up and down the archway in John Street, as if waiting for some one. About six o'clock, a woman living in the same) street was startled by a man of colour, who had previously alarmed her by his dark face, suddenly presenting himself, and asking for a light for his candle; another inhabitant at No. 2 also watched twenty to thirty shabby men go in and out of the stable carrying bags and bundles. One of them, as he stooped, had shown that he was armed.

Several rendezvous had been appointed for the conspirators. Some were to assemble near John Street, and to be brought

to the stable by safe men ; others were directed to the Horse and 0-room. Tidd gathered his party at Hole-in-tlie-Wall Passage, Brunt at Fox's Court, while Thistlewood was to go straight to Cato Street, where the blunderbusses, daggers, pistols, swords, pikes, pitch-balls, and hand-grenades had l)y this time been collected.

At two o'clock on the afternoon of that day eight or ten of the conspirators met at Brunt's room, to fit flints to pistols and slings to cutlasses. Many of the men were still ignorant of what was to be done. They were only to be told at the stable, when it was too late to retract. On Thistlewood's arriving, he said —

"Well, my lads, this looks something like as if you were going to do something."

He then promised to give the men liquor, and sent out for drink for the informer Adams, who seemed very much depressed.

At the same time he sent for cartridge-paper, on which proclamations could be written. He then sat down and wrote : —

"Your tyrants are destroyed— the friends of liberty are called upon, as the provisional government is now sitting.

"James Ings, Secretary.

"February 23, 1820."

These bills were to be pasted up near the houses that were to be set on fire, and would, it was supposed, arouse the people. When Thistlewood had written three of the bills he said he was tired, and did not know what was the matter with him ; he could write no more. Another man then wrote a fourth. In the mean time Ings, with butcherly eagerness for blood, was preparing himself for action. He put on a black belt to bold two pistols, a bolt round his shoulder for a cutlass, and two large canvas havresacks, iu which, he swore, he intended to carry the heads of Lord Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth, before setting them on pikes and carrying them before the captured cannon. When he had done all this, he viewed himself complacently, and said, with professional jocosity —

"I have not got my steel— I am not complete ; but never mind."

He then drew a large, heavy, broad butcher's knife from his pocket, and showed the new-ground edge, and the handle bound round with dark waxed thread, to prevent his hand slipping, as he said, "when he should be at work." With

that knife he swore he would cut off the heads " of Castlereagh and the rest as he came at them/^

In the momentary absence of the dreaded Thistlewood and lirunt, a man named Palin said he hoped all present knew what they had met there for, and had considered whether the assassination would be approved by the country, and would really draw the people to their help. J ust then Brunt returned. Observing an alteration in the men's countenances, and being told the reason, he said —

"This is not the place. Go with mo to Edgware Boad. There yen shall know what you are going about, and all that goes al<|[ig with me I will take care shall have a drop of something to drink to put them in spirits."

The conspirators^ then armed themselves, put on their great-coats to conceal their weapons, and started for the rendezvous.

In the stable the men began at once to clean the arms, which were lying on a bench in the loft, and to ferrule the pikes. The non-arrival of Tidd and his contingent, however, alarmed Thistlewood, and produced confusion among the conspirators, as they already knew that Lord Sidmouth had had intimation of their meetings in Brook's Market.

Ings, seeing his comrades' faces lengthen, began to stamp and swear, and tear his hair.

If you begin to talk of dropping the concern now," he said, I will wither cut my throat or shoot myself."

Brunt said there was no occasion for uneasiness; he would forfeit his existence if Tidd was not forthcoming. Thistle•wood kept quiet, and said —

"For God's sake do not think of dropping the business now; if you do, it will turn out a second Despard job." Then he looked round and said, You seem to think there are not men sufficient." (He cast up the number.) "Let us see, there are ciglitecii here, and two below; that makes twenty; that is quite sufficient ; suppose there to be sixteen servants ill Lord Harrowby's liouse, they are not armed ; we shall go prepared, and it will not take us, from entering the house and coining out, more than ten minutes."

Fourteen men were to execute the murders, and six to be left to guard the servants. As the fourteen men were volunteering and being called out, Tidd entered, and Thistlewood, probably suspecting him to be a waverer, fixed his eyes sternly upon him ; but, seeing Adams watching him, he turned away directly. Adams going up to Tidd, said to him, tentatively—

" Don't you think this is a pretty set out ? Do you think they will be able to do this thing ? "

Edd replied, in an ominous whisper, "Never."

Brunt had just produced a gin^bottle from bis pocket to prime the assassins, when Adams heard somebody in the stable below.

Yes, the toils had long slowly been gathering round these desperate wretches. Into that loft, as into a full rat-pit, the sharp-toothed terriers of the law were ready to dash. In other rooms besides that of Cato Street cutlasses had been that morning ground, and pistol-flints fitted. The Bow Street officers had already been lurking about the Horse and Groom public-house, and had secured a pike-stave left by one of the conspirators. About half-past eight, twelve of thora\ lad mot by appointment near John Street, and moved on together towards the well-marked stable. In t^e mean time. Lieutenant Fitzclareiice, with a picquet of the Coldstream Guards, had been sent by Mr. Birnio, the police magistrate, to wait in John Street till they were called. Buthven (a tall, sandy Scotchman), Smithers, Ellice, and others of the patrol found the stable-door watched by two or throe men. The man of colour, Davidson, and Ings were guarding the stairs, with blunderbusses on their shoulders and swords by their sides. Bnthven instantly ordered these men to be? secured, and mounted the ladder, followed by Ellice, Smithers, and three or four others.

There were about five and twenty men iu the room, eating bread and cheese and drinking porter, or selecting arms from a long carijen tor's bench which stood close by the wall. Just at that juncture, Thistle wood, hearing a noise, and some one calling, " Hallo ! Show a light ! " took a candle, and looked down the stairs to see who was coming, and on seeing that there was a surprise he put the candle back on the bench, seized a sword, and, with three or four others, retreated stealthily to the further of the inner rooms — the one that bad a window looking out into Cato Street. At that moment, ono of the men seized Mow called up to warn his comrades — Look out there, above!"

At the same time two of the constables, at first almost unnoticed, appeared at the top of the ladder, and presenting their pistols, said ; —

"Hallo! is anybody in the room? Here is a pretty nest of you?"

Then another of the patrol cried —

"We are officers; seize their arms!"

And a third —

"Gentlemen, we have got a warrant to apprehend you all, and as such we hope you will go peaceably."

JuBt then Smithars, distrusting further parley, and believing, in his stanch way, in promptitude before the conspirators could discover the scantiness of the assailing numbers, or could muster courage to use their arms, cried —

" Lot me come forward."

He then pushed towards the door of the inner room, where Thistlewood stood thrusting with a very long sword. This leader of the conspirators instantly rushed forward, and struck Smithers through his right side. The constable threw up his hands, his head fell back, he staggered against Ruthven, cried,

"Oh, my God, I am done!" and fell dead near the opening of the stairs. Ellice held up his staff at Thistlewood, and threatened to fire with the pistol in his right hand, unless he instantly surrendered- The lights were immediately dashed out, and a voice cried in the darkness —

"Kill the at once! Throw them downstairs! Kill them!"

Then there were twenty or thirty pistol-shots fired, and a tremendous headlong rush was made at the stairs, driving the Bow Street men backwards; the conspirators leaping down into the manger through the holes in the floor, or by the window, others firing at the officers on the stairs, or up through the manger, all making for the archway in Jolm Street. Tidd was caiiglit in the doorway, thrown on a dungheap by h nth veil, and disarmed. Davidson was pursued and taken in John Street. Wr*iglit, a patrol, was knocked down and stabbed by lugs, who was caught by a watchman in Edgware Road, after having tired at Brooks, one of the officers, wlio had attacked him with his cutlass.

In the mean time the jhequet of Foot Guards, hearing pistol-shots in the stable, had dashed up at the double, being mot by a police officer, who shouted to them —

"Soldiers, soldiers! The doorway! The stable!"

As Lieutenant Fitzclarence entered the door a man cut at him furiously with a sword, but retreated before the soldiers, who then captured four of the remaining conspirators. Thistlewood had escaped before this in the first rush, firing at Westcott, a constable, cutting at him, and felling him.

The prisoners taken were searched at the Horse and Groom, and the loft was then ransacked for arms. The soldiers found several parcels of bayonets, sharpened files, and pike-heads, a box containing five hundred and sixty-five ball-cartridges, fire-balls made of tow dipped in tar and brimstone, and some grenades full of cart-nails.

Brunt was seized the next day at his own house, and was just despatching two baskets full of grenades and fire-Mls to

some accomplice living in the Borough. The same morning Thistlewood was seized in bed in a room with the shutters up on the ground floor of No. 8, White Street, Finsbury Square. He was partly dressed, and in his coat, lying by his bedside, were found a silk sash, some bullets, and a ball-cartridge. In Tidd's house. No. 5, Hole-in-the Wall Passage, were discovered a box of ball-cartridges, grenades, flannel bags of powder, bags •of musket-balls, flints, pike-handles, rope-yarn, and tar.

Thistlewood and his gang (eleven in all) were tried on the 17th of April, 1820, at the Sessions House, Old Bailey, Mr. Curwopd and Mr. Adolphus appearing for the. defence, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Littledale, Mr. Reynolds, and Mr. Holland, with the Attorney and Solicitor-General, for the prosecution.

At this trial it was clearly elicited that towards the end of 1819 the prisoners lugs, Brunt, and others, had long planned a conspiracy, Thistlewood openly avowing that he had shared in* four or five revolutions. Shortly before the funeral of the king they agreed to assassinate all the ministers, if possible, at a cabinet dinner. They decided that the Prince Regent family had worn the crown long enough. The plot was always called by the gang the West End job." One night they were debating several diabolical plans, when Edwards (the spy) came in, and told Thistlewood there was a cabinet dinner to be held the following evening. Thistlewood, hardly believing the possibility of such good news, said he did not think it was true, but at once sent for a imper, and read aloud the announcement, to the universal rapture of the gang.

As for Bmiit, he was nearly mad with joy.

'^Now," he cried, with a ferocious oath, "I begin to believe ihca*e is a God ; for I've often prayed those thieves might be got together in order to give us a good opportunity to destroy thormn, and now my prayer is answered."

Thistlewood, always calm, stern, and practical, proposed an instant committee to arrange a fresh plan. Singularly enough, they chose for their chairman Adams, afterwards the informer. He called Thistlewood to order, and expressed his fears of a betrayal. The conspirators began to swear like madmen at this, and Harrison, walking up and down, fixed his eyes on Adams, and said, with an oath —

The next man that drops a word to cool any one, and to .prevent their going forward to do the deed they had determined, I'll run him through with a sword."

When called upon by the Clerk of the Arraigns, Thistlewood denounced the spies and informers as infamous liars and unreliable men, violently denouncing the judges for their servility and ambition, and Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth

as privileged traitors, who lorded it over the lives and property of the sovereign people with barefaced impunity. He said, in iiiitatod and fanatical language-—

few hours hence and 1 shall be no more; but the nightly breeze which will whistle over the silent grave that shall protect me from' its keenness will bear to your restless })illow the memory of one who lived but for his country, and died when liberty and justice had been driven from its confines by a set of villains whose thirst for blood is only to be equalled by their activity in plunder."

Thistlewood proceeded to disclaim any personal motive, but a v|sh for the welfare of his starving countrymen, and pity for the hundreds massacred and trampled on at Manchester. It was after Peterloo, he confessed, that he had resolved on vengeance, "'that the woes of the instigators should be the requiem to the souls of the murdered innoct'iits." In this mood for wreaking what he considered national vengeance, Thistlewood said he had met the man Edwards, who, then poor and penniless, and without even a bed, was living near Pickett Street, in the Strand. He had since that appeared dressed like a ](*i*d, declaring he had been found to be the heir to a German baron. He had, in fact, sold himself as a spy to the Government. This man had proposed to him to blow up the House of Commons, 1o attack the ministers at the Spanish ambassador's fete, or to throw hand-grenades into their carriages as they passed through the streets.

Then Thistlewood grow more excited. He talked of Brutus, and pleaded that when a set of men placed themselves above tile laws and murdered the people, only a private arm could bring them to justice; and it was a duty of every one to rid Ids country of its oppressors.

Lord Chief Justice Abbot interfered, but Thistlewood continued to assert that high treason had been wrought against the Manchester pcoj)le, and justice denied to the mutilated and the maimed. The Prince Regent had thanked the murderers still reeking with their gore. If one spark of honour," be said, "one spark of independence, still glimmered in the breast of Englishmen, they would have rose to a man. Insurrection then became a public duty, and the blood of the victims should have been the watchword to vengeance ou \ licir murderers."

The Chief Justice: We cannot allow this.

Thistlewood: "I have but a few lines more. The banner of independence should have floated in the gale that brought their wrongs and their sufferings to the metropolis; such,

however, was not the case. Albion is still in the chains of slavery, I quit it without regret. I shall soon be consigned to the grave, my body will be immured beneath the soil whereon I first drew breath. My only sorrow is, that the soil should be a theatre for slaves, for cowards, and for despots. My motives, I doubt not, will hereafter be justly appreciated. 1 will therefore now conclude by stating that I shall consider myself as murdered if I am to be executed on the verdict obtained against me."

Davidson denied that he had ever heard of any intentions to dethrone the king, talked of Magna Charta, and the right of the people to arm in order to secure their privileges, and declared that he had been entrapped. He concluded with these words: "I can die but once in this world, and the only regret left is, that 1 have a large family oV small children, and when I think of that it unmans me, and I shall say no more."

Ings, who had once lx)a8ted that he had gone out intending to shoot the Prince Regent as he went to Parliament, and regretted that he had not done so, said that, in his poverty, he had been ensnared by Edwards. He also alluded indignantly to the cruelties at Manchester. cut down

unarmed men, women, and children," he said, "was a disgrace to the name and character of Englishmen. He hoped his children would live to see the day when they should all be free men and see justice administered. I had rather," he concluded, '*dio like a man than live like a slave."

Brunt said his life had been sworn away, he was no traitor or enemy to his king, but only to the boroughmongering faction, who destroyed the vitals of the country. He considered Lord Sidmouth's circular sent out to instigate the cavalry to murder the Manchester men. He admitted that he had attempted what he wished had been done, and he thought the country would have lK*en compensated had those men been put out of the way. "I think," he said, ''it is what they merit — 1 actually think it is what they merit. If a man inurdtjrs my brother, 1 have a right to murder him. What does the sriptures say: 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' I have no private enmity against any gentleman in the country : it was for the public good that I (Niino forward, and I would have gone through with it. Try mo for murder, hang mo, draw mo, quarter me, but let me have justice; that is all I have to say."

Tidd said all the witnesses had sworn falsely except Captain Fitzclarence; as for shooting at that gentleman, as a private gentleman, he w^ould as soon have shot his owm father.

Thistlewood, Davidson, Ings, Brunt, and Tidd were sentenced to be hung, and to have their heads severed from their bodies — the quartering being graciously forgiven.

Wilson, Harrison, Bradburn, Strange, Gilchrist, and Cooper were transported for life. At a cabinet council on Saturday, the 29th of April, the execution of the desperate men was fixed for the ensuing Monday. The governor of Newgate received the death-warrant at seven p.m. on Saturday, and instantly went to the condemned room and read it to the prisoners, who were sitting there watched by eight oflScers. They aU rose respectfully when he entered, and seemed conscious Jf the news that he btought.

Thistlewood said quite calmly: "'The sooner we go, sir, the better — our jvisii is to die as soon as possible." The othe r prisoners expressed the same feeling.

On Mr. Brown's asking them if they wished the assistance of a clergyman of any persuasion, they made no reply.

Th (7 slept soundly nearly the whole night, and only awoke at the unbarring of the cell doors to admit the ordinary, whoso zeal had led him there at inidrikht. Mr. Cotton went to each coll separately, and urged evo^ argument to reclaim thorn to Christianity. Davidson was, however, the only man who joined Mr. Cotton in prayer, and lie did so fervently.

The men could speak to each other through the loops in the cell walls: and lugs, during the night speaking of the scene in the morning, said, with savage bitterness—

" There was plenty of men present, hut, d — n 'em, they have no pluck."

At five o'clock Mr. Cotton came again round the cells with the sacrament. All refused it but Davidson, who received the elements with sincere devotion. Brunt seized tho wine, and drank tho king's health, and so did Davidstin, On the arrival of the sheriffs and attendants, the four leaders were so violent that it was thought prudent to pinion their arms before their irons were struck off. The procession then advanced through the long dark passages—dark even on that bright May morning. Thistlewood came first, his eyes fixed, and abstracted in thought. Then walked Tidd, trying to assume indifference, and rallied by lugs for his depression. After him strode Ings, laughing and reckless, followed by Brunt, who fixed liis eyes on the officers with a sullen rage. Davidson was last, his hands clasped, his eyes uplifted, and his lips moving in prayer. At the lodge leading to the scaffold there was a moment's pause. Thistlewood clenched his lips, and with a frown watched the preparations on the scaffold.

On a bystander beseeching Brnnt to ask God's pardon, Bmnt replied, tritk savage contempt for his adviser —

"What have I done? I have done nothing. What should I ask pardon for?"

"Well done, Brunt," exclaimed Ings, and began to sing—

"O give me death or liberty,"

when he was summoned to the scaffold. He turned to Brunt, smiled, and shook hands with him. On entering the lodge, he had said to some one who told him to be firm —

"Firm? I am firm. But we have children, sir." I There was true pathos in this. '

When the handkerchief was tied on, he cried out —

"I hope, Mr. Cotton, you will give me' a good character." the chaplain bowed. Ings then commenced playfully swinging about in his hand a cotton nightcap. While the hatch was opening, he exclaimed with a loud voice —

"Remember me to King George the Fourth. God bless him, and may he have a long reign!"

He then requested some clothes he had loft behind might be given to his wife. Determined that Jack Ketch should have no coat of his, he had taken off his best clothes, and put on a butcher's old greasy slaughtering jacket.

As he stood on the first step he turned to Davis, a turnkey, and said —

"Well, Mr. Davis, I am going to find out this great secret;" and then sprang on the scaffold, exclaiming: "Good-bye, gentlemen; here goes the remains of an unfortunate man."

Brunt now stood almost alone with Davidson, muttering about the injustice of his fate, and 'wishing to be the next to suffer.

One by one they had gone to death, Thistlewood first. Tlii'oc times the mob had shouted; three times the drop had ialloii with its horrible, dull sound.

Davidson was called next. He was astonishingly composed. On the Sunday, at parting with his wife, he had said, "the day of his death would be the happiest of his life." he was in fervent prayer when he was turned off.

Brunt's last act was to take a pinch of snuff from a paper in his hand, stooping to put it to his nose, and pnsliing up his nightcap to take it. He took off his heavy nailed shoes, as one of the others had also done, and, as the report of the lime says, threw them at the people, either in contempt and brutal defiance, or to cheat the hangman.

Exactly a quarter of an hour after the last man was hung, the order was given to cut the bodies down. The heads were then haggled off with brutal clumsiness with a surgeon's knife. The mob expressed loudly their horror and disgust, more especially when the turnkey, who exhibited the heads, dropped that of Brunt. Hallo, butter-fingers ! " shouted a rough voice from the rolling crowd below. The day had gone by for such useless brutality.* The executions occupied one hour and eight minutes. It was a quarter to eight when Thistlewood appeared on the scaffold, it was seven minutes to nine when Brunt's head, the last exhibited, was placed in the coffin. The hangman's assistant on this occasion was not the late Mr. Walkley, as many people still think, but a poor surgeon in the Edgware Road, who after this became wealthy.

The cavalry, stationed to line all the streets in the neighbourhood, then disi)crscd, and the mob slowly melted away.
