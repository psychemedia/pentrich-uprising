A most horrid attempt was made on Monday night last, to take away the life of Mr. W. Trentham, senr. hosier, of this town. Mr. Trentham had been spending a convivial hour with a few friends, at Mr. Timms's, and returned home about a quarter past ten o'clock. On reaching his own house, in St. Mary's church yard, he knocked for admittance, and while waiting for the door to be opened, two men, whom he had observed to be standing very near, stepped up to him, when one of them instantly, and without uttering a word, discharged a large horse pistol at him, the ball from which entered his right breast, and passing in an oblique direction, lodged near the shoulder. This sudden and unexpected attack occasioned, as might naturally be supposed, the utmost consternation in the family. Mr. Trentham was assisted into the house, and Mr. Wright, surgeon, sent for immediately, who examined the wound, and fortunately succeeded in extracting the ball.—The assassins, who are described by Mr. Trentham, as very small men, instantly fled in different directions. We understand that Mr. Trentham (though not entirely out of danger) is now in a very fair way of recovery.—The Magistrates with the most laudable zeal have used every possible exertion to trace out the perpetrators of this diabolical deed, and have offered a reward of six hundred guineas for their apprehension and conviction; but we have not heard that any certain clue has yet been discovered that will lead to a detection of the wretches.

In order to cover this dreadful attempt on Mr. Trentham's life, a report has been industriously and maliciously circulated, that he had abated the price of his work. We have it from authority to state, that the house has never deviated from the last printed list agreed to by the hosiers, and that therefore the report is entirely without foundation.

Leeds, April 27.—Colonel Campbell, the Inspecting Officer of the district, has been threatened with destruction, for the official discharge of the arduous duty imposed upon him by the present unhappy disturbances. On Saturday last an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfold Mills, by two villains, who fired at him front behind a hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same time from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. The diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile from Huddersfield. Last Friday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, at Mr. G.Whitehead, a constable at the paddock, near Huddersfield, was retiring to rest, a musket or blunderbuss was discharged through his stair-case window, and two slugs, two pistol-balls, and a piece of bone, were lodged in the ceiling. Mr. Whitehead fortunately received no injury.

Mr. Cartwright, who bravely defended his property in Yorkshire, has been fired at three distinct occasions; but without doing him the slightest injury.

Mr. Trentham, notwithstanding his alarming wound, is likely to recover. The *Luddites* have had the audacity to placard the streets of Nottingham in the night, offering reward for Mr. Wilson, the Mayor, dead or alive. He had committed no other offence than signing the offer of a reward of 600*l.* from the corporation of Nottingham, for the discovery of the assassin who shot Mr. Trentham. These infatuated men are said actually meet the streets of Nottingham, in small parties, in the day time, and triumphantly talk over their nightly depredations.

A letter from, Huddersfield, dated Thursday, says— A melancholy circumstance took place in this neighbourhood yesterday evening. As Mr. Horsfall, of this town, was returning to his house at Marsden, about seven miles off, he was shot by some villains, concealed in plantation by the turnpike-road side on Crosland Moor, about two miles from Huddersfield. Mr. H. cried out, 'I am shot— I am murdered!' and turned his horse round, as if intending to go to a public-house about 200 or 300 yards below the plantation; four men made their appearance on the wall, but Mr. H. immediately fell from his horse, and they then went into the wood, and were seen no more. It supposed that no less than four slugs were discharged at him, one of which only has yet been extracted. The shots took place near the groin, and the lower part of the abdomen. Mr H. was concerned in a mill where shear-frames are used for dressing cloth; and it is his undaunted resolution in resisting the daring-association of frame breakers, called *Luddites*, that has marked him out for the vengeance of those lawless ruffians."
