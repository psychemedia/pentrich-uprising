<h1>Introducing James Towle<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-james-towle" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>One event in 1814 stands out - the appearance of James Towle, who would also reappear in 1816, charged with frame breaking at a Mr. Garton’s shop. Several things are notable about this story: first, the trial provides a possible set up for the attack; second, there was an enforcement action against Garton by the perpetrators, in which two men died; the Coroner’s Court returned one verdict of justifiable homicide, and the other, of wilful murder; third, we get a sense that Towle was a known Luddite, and there was some other incident between Towle and Garton that perhaps fuelled the enmity between them.</p>
<p>The reporting also gives us an insight into the opposing views of the pro-Government <em>Nottingham Gazette</em> and the radical <em>Nottingham Review</em>.</p>
<p>It’s September, harvest time. And the Luddites are out again. The <em>Nottingham Review</em> wonders whether a system of alarms, in the form of rattles — as used in <em>that London</em> — to be used if ever a house or a shop is attacked, in order to attract the attention of the patrols that have started to be posted again, might help? But these are rural villages, not city streets, and attacks often take place some distance apart.</p>
<p>It was well-known that, even though they were neighbours, and had known each other for years, Thomas Garton, a workshop owner, and James Towle, a frameworker, did not get on. Some time previously, Towle had gone with another man to pick up one of Garton’s frames, and Garton had chastised him for “bringing that frame breaker Towle” with him. Another time, garton had told the same man that if any more his frames were broken in the next five years, he’d have Towle taken up.</p>
<p>And as for Towle, he had little respect for Garton either.</p>
<p>At the Three Crowns public-house, in Parliament-street, Nottingham, Towle, a short man, five feet two inches high, and in his early thirties,  had got out of the house where his children were ill with measles. He’d just made plans to sleep at Bamford’s house the following night, where he rented a frame; he had a job to do that needed a steady eye; so he needed a good night’s sleep, and an early start. And he wouldn’t get that at home.</p>
<p>Over a pint, he was quizzing a man about Garton’s workshop.</p>
<p>“So “has he abated then?” meaning, had Garton reduced the mens’ wages. A nod.</p>
<p>“I knew it… and he’s also killing tup mutton, forcing the men to buy it on truck; b————d; they should break ‘em all.” The next day, Towle’s drinking partner reported his tale to Garton. That night, Garton received a visit.</p>
<p>Later that evening, Towle called round at Growcock, the blacksmith’s, in search of a crow bar. One of the blacksmith’s men heard his master say “you should leave off the frame-breaking”, but Towle was insistent.</p>
<p>And then, three workshops are attacked: Thomas Ford’s and James Smith’s, both in the parish of Basford; and Thomas Garton’s, in New Basford.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">In need of alarms? September 1814</p>

<p>Nottingham Review - Friday 09 September 1814</p>
<p>It gives us more than ordinary concern to find the baneful ravages of frame-breaking again commenced at Basford; a system which reason, policy, and every honorable and prudential feeling of the human mind forbids; which the law has rendered felony; and which can only be persevered in from a principle of the most inconsiderate and hateful revenge. In this town, the Magistrates have ordered a nightly parade of the military, headed by police officers, as a preventative to the crime; but, if every man who is in danger of these nocturnal visits, would provide himself with a stout rattle, which, by being sprung on the first alarm, (and this could always be done before the depredators could enter a well barricaded house,) all this mischief might be prevented; for, at the sound of one of the rattles which are used by the watchment in London, a whole neighbourhood would be alarmed in a few minutes: and the depredators, for fear of detection, must depart with out having accomplished their object. Nay, the well known fact that such means of exciting alarm would be resorted to, would prevent the attempt from being made. We hope to see this measure resorted immediately; and perhaps the hosiers and magistrates would do well to order a number of large rattles to be made and sold at a moderate expense, and to use their influence for all holders of frames to possess them; in which case all suspicion would be removed, or pointedly fixed (though, perhaps generally unfounded) of such holders of frames conniving at the depredations. The public at large too, are in duty bound to prevent as much as possible, the commission of the crime, as well on the score of private interest, as on that of preventing the moral habits of society from being perverted and vitiated; for, we understand that those whose property is thus injured will recover damages from the Town or County funds; in which case near the whole individual mischief will fall upon the poor workman that holds the frames thus injured; for, though his bread be taken from himself and family, as is the case with poor Ford of Basford, he will find no redress. Therefore those who thus commit these depredations will not so much injure the hosier as their fellow-workmen, who happen to hold the frames.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, about twelve o’clock, a party of frame-breakers, supposed about twenty, made a forcible entrance into the house of Thomas Ford, of Basford, and demolished five valuable frames; two belonging to Mr. Kelk, two to Mr. Pinegar, and one to Mr. Adams, of this town. Four of them were three-needle, and the other a common thirty. Two of the former were making silk hose, at the standard price of the trade; and the other three were making cotton hose; the two finer of which were abated threepence per pair, and the other two per pair on Saturday last, <em>and not sooner</em>. The frames were employed by Mr. Gibson, in this town, from whom and from For, we have had this account, as far as respects the work and prices.</p>
<p>From Ford’s, the depredators proceed to the house of James Smith, in the same parish, where they also demolished five cotton frames, four of which belonged to, and were employed by Mr. Mew, of this town. And on Mew’s testimony we have to state, that the prices for making the hose were not abated till last Saturday: and also, that he did not abate the Price of any work which the workmen stated to have been made previous to last week. The other frame belonged to Mrs. Wyld.</p>
<p>After the spoilation was committed at Smith’s the framebreakers proceeded to the house of Thomas Garton, of New Basford, where six frames were broken, one of which belonged to himself, one to his brother, to a Mr. Hazledine of Basford, and one to Mr. Barton, of this town. To whom the other two belonged we are not acquainted. Nor have we the same means of speaking as to the prices received and paid by Garton, as we have of the other two. One person is in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the depredations, but, with the nature of the evidence against him, we are not fully acquainted.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The midnight work of destruction, September 1814</p>

Nottingham Gazette - Friday 09 September 1814</p>
<p>It is our humiliating and painful duty to record another daring atrocity here. While the <em>Review</em> unblushingly advocates in open day the principle—yes—the <em>principle</em> upon which they act, the frame-breakers assiduously pursue their midnight work of destruction, and demolished, so late as last Sunday night, between twelve and one o’clock, not less than sixteen cotton and silk frames at Old and New Basford. The villains commenced their operations at the shop of one Smith, in old Basford, where they broke five cotton frames, and discharged a piece, happily without effect, at a man who ventured to look from his window, on hearing a noise. From Smith’s they proceeded Ford’s shop, in the same village, where they destroyed five more frames, two silk and one cotton. Ford, who is a most industrious man, but in ill health, with a large family, had a stone throw at his head by the villains, which knocked him down. From Ford’s, the ruffians went Mr. Garton’s in New Basford, where they broke six cotton frames, one the property of Mr. Garton, and another that of his brother, and carried off several articles of property.</p>
<p>Mr. Garton had several of his men sleeping in the house, but without arms, and under the influence of terror and agitation, resistance was offered to the depredators. On hearing a noise, Mr. Garton got up and asked, “Who is there?”. He was answered with an execration, “It is Ned!” In a moment the door was broken open, when he retreated into his bed-room, over which several of his unwelcome visitors kept guard till their accomplices finished their employment. He could distinctly hear a voice from the street, continually saying, “All’s well! Do your duty, Ned! all’s well!” At one time, he concludes, this sentinel or commander had been disturbed by some noise, as he rushed into the house, and ordered the villains to stop! In a few seconds, however, the “All’s well” was repeated, and they were ordered to proceed. It remarkable, that they have left several frames in Mr. Garton’s shop untouched. The sixteen frames thus destroyed, are chiefly what are called independents; that is, frames which are let out by persons not actually engaged in the trade. Many families are thus deprived of bread, from the men who worked in them being thrown out of employment, and Mr. Garton, Ford, and Smith, may be considered ruined men. A fellow named Tow, [<em>sic</em>] has been apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in this last outrage; and is, we understand, to be examined to-morrow. Many circumstances have come to our knowledge which warrant a belief that it is at length likely this dreadful system, ruinous to the district, will be detected and overturned. It would be at present imprudent to divulge them, and perhaps unjust and injurious to the man in custody; but we trust the Magistrates will exert themselves to the uttermost not to lose the present opportunity of making a close and through investigation, and that they will conduct neither distinguished by “over-active zeal” nor “supine negligence” nor <em>misplaced clemency</em>, entitle themselves to the gratitude of the public on this important occasion. The Society for prosecuting Frame-breakers, also, ought to exert themselves: a clue is afforded them which may lead to important results; and they may answer the ends of their association much more effectually by entering warmly, into the present affair, and by giving every facility and encouragement in their power to the prosecution, which we know are much wanted, than they can hope for from merely advertising rewards for the apprehension of unknown depredators. We trust this hint will be taken in good part, and will be attended to, and earnestly hope that the ruinous and disgraceful system of frame-breaking may be speedily overthrown. Legal notices have been given by Messrs. Garton and some others, of their intention to recover their losses from the county.</p>

<p>Thomas Garton was the leading witness against Towle, and the Luddites knew this. Threats of violence were made against hinm, Garton suspected that an attack would follow. His wife went to stay with a neighbout, a certain Mr Kilby, while Garton remained at home, to wait with several others recruited to aid his defence.</p>
<p>When the attack came, an was entry forced, and a demand was made for Garton to show himself; as the candles went out, there was confusion, and shots were fired, killing one of the Luddites, a lad named Samuel Bamford, outright. As they retreated, presumably trying to quell the fears of Mrs Garton, who was likely hysterical at the noises she could hear coming from her own home, went to the door to see what was happening. Outside, the Luddites saw him, told him to go back inside or he would have his brains blown out. Perhaps Kilby tried to object, or perhaps Mrs Garton joined the fray. But something happened. Another shot was fired, and Kilby was instantly killed.</p>

<p>DREADFUL OUTRAGE.</p>
<p>We regret to learn, that the most dreadful outrages and confusion continue to prevail in the vicinity of Nottingham. On Friday night murder was added to the guilt of the offenders:—</p>
<p>“Nottingham, October 15.— Last night the village of Basford, in the vicinity of Nottingham, was thrown into a dreadful state of alarm by one of the most daring outrages ever committed. A short time ago, a person of the above village, of the name of Towle, was arrested on suspicion of having been concerned in breaking some frames at the house of one Garton, a neighbour, and who is the principal evidence against him. An attempt was therefore made last night to destroy Garton and his evidence both together but some information on the subject having been received by the Magistrates of Nottingham, they planted a party of constables in the house, and Garton was secured elsewhere. About nine at night the house of this object of desperate vengeance was entered by a party of armed desperadoes in disguise; the first having a pistol and bayonet, demanded Garton, at the same time knocking out the lights, when a dreadful fight began; pistols were discharged on both sides, a ball grazed the thigh of one of the police officers’ assistants; one of the assailants had his brains blown out on the spot, whose name is Bamford, an inhabitant of Nottingham, when his companions retreated; and, a neighbour of the name of Bilby [<em>sic</em>], coming out of his house, at the moment, received a ball in his side, which instantly deprived him of life. None of the depredators were taken, except the man that was killed; and, about one o’clock, they assembled again; but perceiving soldiers about, that had been ordered to the spot, they again decamped. Such is the state of the case, as it appears at present; but, as the Coroners Inquest will sit to-morrow over the bodies, some more information on the subject may come out.”</p>
</div>
<p>At the coroner’s court, the two deaths received very different verdicts.</p>

Nottingham Review - Friday 21 October 1814</p>
<p>A most painful task devolves upon us this week, in the having to record and publish to our country, acts of sanguinary violence and assassination, committed in the vicinity of Nottingham, which are disgraceful to the character of Englishment, and to humanity. We allude to the foul and horrid attempt to murder Mr. Thomas Garton, and the actual murder of Mr. William Kilby, committed last Friday evening at New Basford; the circumstances of which have excited universal indignation, and sympathy in this town and neighbourhood. On of the assailants upon Mr. Garton’s house (Samuel Bamford, formerly of Basford, but late of Nottingham), met his doom in the very act of commencing the attack, — he was instantaneously killed, by a shot in the head, from those who were stationed in the house for its defence, and fell grasping a pistol in his hand. Inquests were held on the bodies of the deceased, before Mr. Wright, one of the Coroners for the county, at the Flough Inn, in Basford, on Sunday last. From the evidence given, in the case of Samuel Bamford, it appeared, that about five or six weeks ago, an attack was made upon Mr. Garton’s house by a number of disguised men, who broke and destroyed several frames. That upon Mr. Garton’s information, one man, named James TOWLE, had been committed, and then lay in the county gaol for trial for this offence, at the next assizes,….and that in consequence of such proceeding, threats of violence against Mr. Garton had been expressed, so as to excite in him great apprehension as to his personal safety. That intimation of the probability of an early execution of these threats was providentially received by Mr. Garton, which induced him to be more particularly upon his guard, and to have in his house a force sufficient for its defence. That on Friday evening last, about half-past nine, a forcible attack was made upon the house by a body of men, disguised and armed, (of whose number we cannot learn that any accurate judgement can be formed), three of whom first broke in, (the deceased being one), and were immediately followed by others— that one of them cried out “Damn him, where is he?” and that from some of them three shots were fired in the house before the fire was turned— that the persons stationed to protect the house, then fired in the defence of their lives and of the property of Mr. Garton, and the deceased fell — that several other shots were fired, and at length the assailants retreated and made their escape, under the total darkness into which the house was thrown by the explosions of the fire-arms. The jury, without hesitation, delivered their verdict of—”<em>Justifiable Homicide.</em>”</p>
<p>The case of Mr. William Kilby, excited great interest. It appeared that the deceased (a man of excellent character, industrious habits, and very much respected), was in his own house (about thirty yards from Mr Mr. Garton’s), between nine and ten o’clock, on the evening of Friday the 14th instant, and that Mrs. Garton was there…that Mrs. Garton expressing her alarms at the noise heard in the street, the deceased went out to see what was the matter, when he was instantly shot, and fell dead at his own door. It appeared further in evidence, that preceding the firing of the piece which killed the deceased, one of the neighbours who was attracted by the sound of fire-arms from Mr. Garton’s, went to the door, and was immediately addressed by a man, who swore at him, and told him to go in and shut his door, or he would blow out his brains…and that another neighbour who also went to his door from the like cause, was similarly threatened and a pistol put to his face. A ball was extracted from the wounds of the deceased, by the surgeon (Mr. Williams), and produced in evidence before the Inquest. The jury found a verdict of… “<em>Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.</em>”</p>
<p>The surviving perpetrators of these atrocious crimes have escaped, but, however at present they may be unknown, we hope and trust they will not elude detection, and that the just vengeance of the offended laws of their God and their country, will finally overtake them.</p>
</div>
<p>Following the murder of Kilby, a reward was offered in the name of the King for information that would lead to the arrest of those involved.</p>

<h2>The (First) Trial of James Towle<a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-trial-of-james-towle" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>An first attempt at a telling…</p>
<div class="dropdown seealso admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">James Towle, tale the first</p>
<p>The trial of James Towle was presided over by Mr. Justice Bayley.  Towle was accused of breaking in to Thomas Garton’s house and, with several others, breaking Garton’s frames. It is said that fifty pounds had been raised in subscription amongst the frameworknitters to help retain Towle’s Counsel.</p>
<p>During the trial, key witness Thomas Garton declared that it was Towle who had originally demanded entry, immediately recognising him from his voice, although he didnlt actually see him: he had known Towle for years, and they only lived a few hundred yards apart.</p>
<p>As the Luddites were forcing entry, Garton had retreated to his bedroom upstairs; he’d listened as they smashed his frames, knew there was no point trying to stop them. When he was sure they were gone, he dressed himself and went to fetch the local constable, then immediately went round to Towle’s house, demanding Towle’s presence, but the constable claimed he had no authority to enter the property, so Garton whent to find the constable at Old Basford who <em>would</em> search the house. But to no avail.</p>
<p>Eventually, at six in the morning, they discovered Towle, at Bamford’s house in Basford-lane, where Towle worked a frame. The constable apprehended and took him to Nottingham.</p>
<p>“So did you see my chisel, and my sword, when you searched my house then?” he asked him.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m blind?” replied the constable. And as soon as he could, rushed back to Towle’s to check. And indeed, when the chisel was compared with the damage caused to the door frame of Garton’s house as it was forced open, the two matched.</p>
<p>When the blacksmith’s man was shown the chisel and asked if that could be what the blacksmith had given Towle the night before the raid, he just stared back. “That’s a chisel. Not a crow bar.”</p>
<p>It was now time for Towle to state his defence; but he simply replied that he and Garton had quarrelled, and that this was Garton’s revenge, and his witnesses were called.</p>
<p>As well as the men who would testify to Barton’s having always said he’d come after Towle if ever any of his frames were broken, his main witness was Samuel Bamford. You might recall the name. His son had been shot, and killed — and act of <em>justifiable homicide</em>, they’d called it — at Garton’s, six months before.</p>
<p>Towle’s kids were ill with the measles, so Towle had asked if he could spend the night, get a good night’s rest, an early start for a tricky job he had to finish, and had arrived about 11. He’d gone up to bed in the upstairs room, with Bamford’s lads, while Bamford slept in the parlour by the stairs. Bamford’s wife had locked the door and taken the key to bed with her. There was no way Towle could have left the house. The stairs creaked, and the door was locked. There was a window in the room where Towle slept, but it’d be a heck of a tight squeeze, And a long drop into the muddy ditch below with no way back up. You’d have to be some sort of magician to get in and out of that room without anyone noticing. There was no way he could have done it.</p>
<p>From his description of the house, Bamford was obvuiosly trying to make it clear that no one could get out, or come in, in the night, without his knowledge; and he believed, <em>on his oath</em>, that Towle had not left the house that night.</p>
<p>These were the days before Ludwig and Jonathan Creek, remember. And also the days in which Juries were as likely to be swayed, or not, by circumstance and alibi, as well as the Judge’s summing up.</p>
<p>As it was, Bamford had got up at three am, when Towle stirred and gave him a candle light to work by. When the constable had come looking for him, Towle had had to get the key from Bamford’s wife.</p>
<p>When the prosecuting counsel then asked him about the circumstances of his son having been shot in the attack on Garton’s, the Judge interposed, and stopped any further questions on that account.</p>
<p>In summing up, the Judge advised to the Jury that the only evidence limnking Towle to the crime was the claim that his voice had been heard, a form of testimony that could not be relied upon. There had been the evidence from the pub the night before the attack, but Towle was surely not so indiscreet if he had been serious about breaking Garton’s frames the following night. It’s true he might have been an accessory — he might have lended his chisel to the frame breakers that night — but he was charged with the act itself, not being an accessory to it. As for what Garton had or hadnlt send about having Towle taken up if any of his frames were broken? Well, it was a case “he said”, “oh, no, I didn’t”, and the jury would have to decide for themselves how to interpret <em>that</em> evidence.</p>
<p>And so the jury to, and spent the next half an hour or so in their box, deliberating.</p>
<p>And then, they returned their verdict: <em>not guilty</em>. As soon as the crowd of framewrok-knitters who had gathered outside the Court heard the verdict, a huge cheer went up, followed by morning cheering in favour of the Judge as he made his way back to his lodgings.</p>

<p>Nottingham Gazette - Friday 24 March 1815</p>
<p>NOTTINGHAM LENT ASSIZES</p>
<p>JAMES TOWLE</p>
<p>Aged 32, stood capitally indicted with having burglariously broke into the dwelling house of Thomas Garton, of Basford, on the night of Sep. 4, 1814, and of having therein broke six Stocking Frames.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan, one of the Counsel for the Crown, in this trial, addressed the Jury in a very luminous speech, in which he detailed the circumstances of the outrage at Garton’s, which are already well known to our readers. He alluded to the atrocious character of the crime of which the prisoner stood accused, to its general prevalence, and to the difficulty and danger of resisting the bands of armed Luddites who engaged in its perpetration. He trusted the jury, if the evidence produced should satisfy them of the guilt of the prisoner, would do their duty firmly. They would be cautious in forming their judgement. If it should be in favour the prisoner, they would of course acquit him. If against him they would firmly bring in their verdict accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Garton</em> was first examined. He is a frame-work knitter, and lives at New Basford; occupied a house five rooms on the ground floor; his workshop is on the first floor. On the evening of Sunday September 4, he went to bed about ten o clock, all his family having previously retired to rest. The doors and windows the house were made fast by himself; the street door was fastened by a lock, and by a bar across the middle. After having been asleep some time, he was awakened by a noise outside his house, and by his dog barking: he jumped up, opened his chamber door, and called out, “who’s there?” the prisoner answered “it’s Ned.” He knew the voice of the prisoner at once; as he is well acquainted with it, having known him seven years; and lived within a hundred yards of his house. He again hollowed out, and the answer was, “Ned,” in prisoner’s voice. The voice the prisoner, he said, is remarkable. Immediately after the second answer, the street door flew open, upon which witness retired into his bed room, which is on the first floor, at the top of the stairs, and adjoins the workshop. The voice of the prisoner now called twice for a light. He heard the persons who had got into the house now enter the frame shop, where they began to destroy the frames, while a person stood on the stairs, saying— ‘Ned, do your duty.’ This was not in the voice of the prisoner. They were about half an hour in the shop. From what he heard, he thinks the frames were broken with hammers or bars. He believes there were seven or eight persons breaking the frames. He had eleven frames in his shop. As soon they were gone, he dressed himself, and called up his next door neighbour, Embley Dunn, who is a Constable, to his assistance. They went to prisoner’s house, and got there a little after two o’clock in the morning. His door was shut. Dunn said he would not enter the house, as he had no authority. Witness then knocked, and called “James Towle,” on which a light was brought. On Dunn refusing to enter the house, witness sent to Old Basford, for another constable, John Seymour. He went in with witness, and searched the house. Prisoner was not in. They went to Papplewick, about four miles off, in consequence of something they had heard at prisoner’s house, but prisoner was not there. On getting back about six in the morning, they went to Bamford’s, in Basford-lane, where they found the prisoner, and apprehended him. When witness examined his workshop, he found that six frames were broken, and that the needles and star brasses were carried off, together with three and a half pair of hose. One of the frames was his own, two belonged to Thomas Deane, one Thomas Barton, one to James Heseldine. and one to John Garton, witness’s brother.</p>
<p>In his cross-examination, witness said he had no means of knowing that prisoner had a frame at Bamford’s, and worked there. He does not know that prisoner’s children had the measles, at the time the frames were broken. He never made any threats as to prisoner. He never in his life said, that if at any time any of his frames were broken, he would swear it to prisoner. Never said would prisoner suffer for it. Does not know man of the name of Kilner; knows Reuben Kilburn, an Irishman, who worked for him. Never in his life said, either to Kilburn, or to Torr, that he would have prisoner taken up, if at any time any of his frames were broken. Never in his life said to any person, that he would charge prisoner. At the time his frames were broken, five of his workmen who slept in the house, were in, namely, T. Tindley, Jos. Fant, Reuben Kilburn, Henry Wybey, or some such name, and a man named Richard. They did not sleep in one room. One of their bed rooms was next door to his bed room, and his shop was the other side of his bed room. His room was between the shop and theirs. He is certain it was prisoner’s voice he heard. He turned his head round to his wife at the time, and said, ‘that is James Towle.’ He has known prisoner well for seven years, and never has had any doubt that it was prisoner’s voice he heard. Never in his life said, would have Towle taken up if any of his frames were ever broken.</p>
<p>Re-examined for the prosecution.—Never has had the least doubt of Towle being the man. Prisoner’s wife was living at her husband’s house at the time of the depredation. Never had any dispute with Towle his life.</p>
<p><em>John Seymour</em>—Is constable of Old Basford. Was sent for at three o’clock on the Monday morning to Garton’s. People who were about the house, said he was at Towle’s. As witness was coming to Garton’s, he saw a light and a man in Bamford’s house. Witness spoke to Bamford, and the light was put out. Witness searched prisoner’s house. Prisoner’s wife and children were at home. He then went to a place called Middle Mill to look for Towle, did not find him. He returned between six and seven and apprehended prisoner at Bamford’s, and took him to Nottingham. Never promised nor threatened prisoner. Prisoner said he wanted to speak to him. They went into another room, when prisoner asked witness if he had seen the chisel and sword at his house when he searched it. Witness said, did you think I was blind? Prisoner then told him to say nothing about it. On going to prisoner’s again that day, he found the chisel, which he produced in court. The chisel, on being afterwards tried, was found to fit exactly the marks made in forcing open Garton’s street door. The marks corresponded exactly.</p>
<p>Cross-examined.— Witness did not know prisoner worked at Bamford’s, nor did he find any frame in prisoner’s house. Never said to Garton, ‘Now you may swear to Towle, for he is not at home.’ It was day light when he apprehended prisoner. Found him tying his shoes, as if just up. He had seen him open window.</p>
<p><em>Edward Hawke</em> worked with Garton for about four months previous to the frames being broken, and till that time. Saw Towle on the Saturday before the frames vere broken, at the Three Crowns public-house, in Parliament-street, Nottingham, in company with many others. Prisoner asked witness if he worked at Garton’s, and if had “<em>bated</em>,” (reduced their wages.)— Witness said, “Yes,” on which prisoner upbraided him about Garton killing tup mutton, and forcing his men to take it. Witness said, it was not true. Prisoner then said, Garton had <em>bated</em>, and his frames should be broken. Prisoner asked where witness’s frame stood. Witness told him, on which, prisoner said, he knew well where it stood, and what it was working, and that it was 36 guage. Prisoner repeated that the frames should be broken. Witness told Garton of this conversation next day, (the Sunday when the frames were broken.) Never has been in Garton’s since the frames were broken. Has very little knowledge of Towle. Only knew him since he worked with Garton.</p>
<p>Cross-examined.—Has never gone by any other name than that of Edward Hawke. Knows a man named Reuben, who worked with Garton.  Witness has lived at Mansfield since the frames were broken, and has never received any thing from Garton, nor has he seen him since till the seventh of this mouth.</p>
<p><em>Joseph Sutton</em> worked with ——— Growcock, a Blacksmith, and slept at his house the night Garton’s frames were broken. He went to bed at half past eight o’clock that night. Growcock went to bed at nine. Prisoner came to the house between nine and ten. Witness knew his voice, and heard him call Growcock up, and ask him to lend him an iron crow. Growcoock said he would not lend him the crow, as he might be noticed if it were lost. Growcock desired prisoner to leave off the business of frame-breaking, or he would be catched out and hanged. Prisoner replied, “I’ll be d——d if I don’t reinforce.” Witness heard Growcock name Towle, and say he would lend him an iron bar, when they went out together, and witness heard the shop door unlocked.</p>
<p>Cross-examined. On being shown the chisel found at prisoner’s house he said a bar is not a chisel. He knew prisouer’s voice before he heard Towle named.</p>
<p><em>Susannah Garton</em>, wife of Thowas Garton, corroborated the evidence of her husband.</p>
<p><em>Garton</em> called by his Lordship. He saw his frames safe at eight o’clock on the Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The Proprietors of the frames being called, said they were broken without their consent.</p>
<p>Towle being asked if he had any thing ta say in his defence. “It is nothing but malice, through Garton and I having quarrelled, that I have been charged with this, I believe my witnesses can prove it.”</p>
<p><em>Samuel Bamford</em> lived at Old Basford in September, He employs men, and works with them the frame. Prisoner rented the stand of a frame in his house from August last, and worked regularly there til apprehended. Towle made application to sleep in his house on the Sunday morning of the outrage, as his children were ill of the measles, He had some work to do in a great hurry, which was of a fine description, and required regular rest, which prisoner could not get at his own house, on account of the illness of his children. He was work on <em>shammys</em>,” which requires great attention of the eyes. Prisoner is a ready hand, but it would require close sitting for him to finish the work with the time that was allowed him. Prisoner was allowed to sleep in the bed of another workman, named Lowe, who is a married man, and always sleeps with his family in Nottingham, on the nights of Saturdays and Sundays. Prisoner came to witness’s house a little after eleven on Sunday night, and went to bed in less than ten minutes. He slept in a room over the kitchen. Witness sleeps in a parlour on the ground floor; and the foot of the stairs, leading to Towle’s room, is near the parlour door. The steps are loose, and their ends are inserted in the parlour wall. He can easily hear any person going up or coming down the stars. He never remembers an instance of a journeyman getting up to work without his hearing him. Witness had locked his door after Towle came in, but left the key. On witness going to bed, however, his wife got up, and brought the key into their bed room, and laid it on the drawers. He can take upon himself to say, that prisoner could not go out without his knowledge. He was frequently disturbed in the night by his wife, who got out of bed several times, being ill. Prisoner got up to work about three o’clock, when witness struck a light, and gave it to him to go into the workshop to work. The window of the room in which the prisoner slept, is about 14 inches by 10. It is about four yards from the ground, and there is a ditch beneath it, about two feet deep, in which was a deal of mud. No one could enter the window without something to climb upon. There was another window which would admit a man with difficulty, and which no one could get out or come in by, without witness’s knowledge, as there are some tiles below it, over where witness sleeps, and the tiles are loose. Witness remembers Seymour coming to his house on the Monday morning. Prisoner came to witness, and said, “Seymour wants me,” on which witness gave him the key, and prisoner went to him. Prisoner asked Seymour what he wanted, when he replied, “D——n your body. I’ll let you know what I want you for,” and apprehended him.</p>
<p>Cross-examined. He won’t swear that prisoner ever slept at his house before. [Mr. Serjeant Vaughan was then proceeding to examine him, about the circumstances of his son having been shot in the second outrage at Garton’s, with which our readers are acquainted, when the learned Judge interposed, and would not suffer the examination on that point to proceed.]</p>
<p><em>Mr. Serjeant Vaughan</em>. So the prisoner could not work the <em>shammys</em> without a good regular night’s rest.</p>
<p><em>Bamford.</em> Not so well.</p>
<p><em>Mr. V</em>. And he came to your house for the purpose of getting this good night’s rest, which he could not get at home on account of the illness of his children, and it was a Sunday night too?</p>
<p><em>B</em>. Yes.</p>
<p><em>Mr. V</em>. And in order to get this excellent night’s rest, in order to work on the <em>shammys</em>, he went to bed between eleven and twelve, and got up about three!!!</p>
<p><em>B</em>. That was the time.</p>
<p><em>Reuben Kilnar</em> slept at Garton’s the night his frames were broken. He slept ill, having lost a tooth about a week before. He heard the people coming up stairs but did not hear them outside. His room is about seven feet from the staircase, and is so situated, that he must have heard if they had spoken loudly? He heard no one call for lights. He beard Garton lock his door when he went to bed, but did not hear him unlock it nor speak? during the disturbance. He afterwards heard “All’s well” twice, and “Do your duty” once. They appeared to be spoken in a feigned, not a natural voice. Has been in prisoner’s company, and does not believe it was his voice. He heard the first attack upon the outside door, which was very loud and violent, but heard no voice at that time. Witness has worked with Garton from Easter Tuesday till the outrage? Has frequently heard Garton say, that if ever any frames were broken in his shop, he would make Towle suffer for it.</p>
<p>Cross-examined. At one time in particular, John Towle was present in Garton’s house, when Garton said he would make Towle suffer if ever his frames were broken. Mrs. Garton was also there, and nobody else that he can ascertain. It was near the fire place in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Counsel for prosecution, and the Judge—Let John Towle be kept out of the court.</p>
<p>To a number of questions now put to the witness, as to particulars of this alleged conversation, he uniformly answered ‘I can’t recollect. He could not recollect if it was after(?) breakfast, after dinner, or after supper. He could not say that the words, “It’s Ned,” were not said when the house was broken into, nor would he swear that Garton was not out of the room.</p>
<p><em>John Torr</em> remembers that Garton, on the very day after he first went to work with them, said, if ever he ever had any frames broken in five years to come, he would have Towle taken in.</p>
<p>Cross examined. That was the only time he ever heard Garton name Towle. There was nobody present.</p>
<p>Anthony Pearson has worked with Garton, Garton pointed to Towle out of the windows, and said, that’s James Towle; and if ever he had any frames broken, he would have him taken up.</p>
<p>Cross-examined—There was nobody present. Has known Towle about a year. They are companions, and live near together.</p>
<p>Sarah Saxton lives at Basford, near prisoner’s. Remembers when he was apprehended. Was at Towle’s’s house on the Saturday. The children were ill of the measles. Two(?) of them were very cross. They chiefly slept in the same room(?) with prisoner and his wife.</p>
<p>John Lowe permitted prisoner to sleep in his bed at Bamford’s while he was with his family in Nottingham. Two boys, sons of Samuel Bamford, slept in the same room with him.</p>
<p>Bamford called. The two children slept in the same room with Towle. One is 13 years of age, the other eight.</p>
<p>The boys having been sent for by the judge, one of them, the younger was brought into Court, and placed in the witness box; but having stated that he went to neither church nor meeting, and that he could neither say a prayer nor his belief, was not examined.</p>
<p>The jury after deliberating in the box, about half an hour, brought in their verdict. <em>Not Guilty.</em></p>
<p>The judge addressed the prisoner before he left the bar. He said he could not deny but that he had had a most patient and fair trial. He told him that he had stood on dangerous ground, and might have brought much misery on his family, and on every one connected with him. He hoped he would take timely warning, and beware of courses, which were contrary to law, and which it would be found the law would ultimately be strong enough to put down.</p>

Nottingham Gazette - Friday 24 March 1815</p>
<p>We have given an accurate and very long account the trial of James Towle for framebreaking, who was acquitted; and the verdict was no sooner communicated immense to an immense crowd of framework-kniiters and others, who were outside the Court, than they rent the air with the loudest acclamations. The Judge, too, was enthusiastically cheered from the Court to his lodgings. Towle is a little man, and of decent appearance.</p>
<p>It is said that not less than fifty pounds was raised in subscription amongst the frameworknitters, and employed in retaining Towle’s Counsel.</p>
<p>The trial of Mr. Sutton, proprietor of the Review, is postponed, we understand till next Assizes.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Meanwhile, the trial of Charles Sutton, the proprietor of the Nottinghan Review, on a charge of libel for publishing a satirical letter signed off by “General Ludd”, was also due to be heard at this Assizes. But it was postponed until the next Assizes. And in any case, that is another story…</em></p>

<p>…</p>
<p>John Bamford … From the description which witness gave of the interior and situation of the house, he endeavoured to make it manifest, that no one could get out, or come in, in the night, without his knowledge; and he believed on his oath, the Towle had not been out during the night.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>John Torr was next sworn, and he stated that Towle went with him some time ago to take a frame of Garton, on which account the latter said to him shortly after, “You are to blame for bringing Towle with you, for he is a frame-breaker.” And in a conversation about Christmas, 1813, Garton said, “If I have any more frames broken within five years, I will have him taken up.” Witness stated that Reuben Kilder was not present when any conversation of this nature took place with Garton.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On the flat contradiction given by Torr to part of Kilder’s testimony, the Judge remarked in his summing up, that though a person might remember the import of any particular conversation, it did not follow that he must always be correct as to the persons who were present; a circumstance which was frequently proved to most men of observation; and, if confidence could be placed in the testimony of the last three witnesses, it would most materially affect that of Garton’s.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Here the evidence closed; and it may be necessary, for the information of many of our readers, to state the following, in a few of the Judge’s remarks in his summing up, in addition to what we have necessarily given on detailing the evidence. His Lordship said, that there was no evidence to fix the guilt upon the prisoner, but the testimonies of Garton and Sutton, and that was wholly upon swearing to his voice, a species of testimony always to be received with extreme caution and doubt; except the evidence of Hawke, which, if true, proved the prisoner to be one of the most indiscreet men on earth, if he was really serious in what he said; and the circumstance of the chisel, which Towle might have lent the frame-breakers, which, if true, did not affix the <em>actual guilt</em> upon him, because he was not charged as being accessary to the perpetration of the crime, but as a positive committer of it. Had this chisel been the bar named by Sutton, it would have been a strong circumstance in proof of his guilt. Upon the whole, said his Lordship, if the Jury are of opinion that Garton and Sutton’s testimonies are to be depended upon, respecting their swearing to the prisoner’s voice, in opposition to the opposing witnesses, they will then find the prisoner guilty; but, if a doubt remains in their minds, they ought to give the benefit of that doubt to the prisoner, and acquit him.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prosecution, Mr. Serjeant Vaughan and Mr. Reader.— Attorneys, Messrs. Coldham and Enfield, Nottingham. Counsel for the Prisoner, Mr. Serjeant Copley and Mr. Denman—Attorney, Mr. Henry Wilkinson, Nottingham.</p>
