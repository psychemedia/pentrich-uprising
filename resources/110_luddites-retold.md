# Luddite Tales, Retold

As is still the case today, every so often local newspapers would take a historical look back at the news of the past. Such reviews can provide us with a sense of how the original events might have been recalled in folk memory a lifetime or two later.

So let us begin with a remembering, from 1875, of the Luddite times of over fifty years before that. The story starts in 1811, and ends in 1817, a tale of the Yorkshire Luddites, topped and tailed with parallel troubles from the neighbouring counties to the south...

`This is actually a reprint of a column by Walter Thornbury in *All the Year Round* (1867-05-11: Vol 17 Iss 420, pp. 467-474), which would also later appear in "Old Stories Retold", published in 1879.`

OLD STORIES RETOLD. THE LUDDITES.

He (Bonaparte) makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise.  
Old Nottingham the Land Lud.

In the early part of the year 1811, the operation of the decrees of the Emperor of the French against British commerce, coupled with the equally bad effect of the retaliatory British Orders in Council, began to tell painfully on the condition of the working classes. After so many years of war the country was feverish and exhausted. It might well be so. The National Debt had increased, since the accession of George III., by seven hundred millions or thereabouts, so that the total amount was at least eight times as great it had been in 1760; and the enormous sum of thirty-two and a half millions was absorbed yearly for the payment of interest; while Mr Pitt's Sinking Fund turned out a miserable failure. But for the foolish and wicked wars in which the Government had been engaged, the country might have been clear of debt; and, considering the industry of the bulk of the people, and its geographical and other advantages, it should have been the least heavily taxed part of Europe. But Pitt's continental system required the financial screw to be put on painfully tight. Poor people found infinite difficulty in making a living. Every article of consumption, on which it was possible raise a penny, was taxed to the utmost. The quartern loaf was at twenty pence. Salt was almost as dear it is said to be in Central Africa. And the scarcity caused by a series of bad harvests was intensified by the enactment of worse laws. Disaffection filled the land, in spite of fulsome loyal addresses. For the people suffered most cruelly, and they thought they saw the cause of their sufferings in their selfish inconsiderate rulers. The food of many of them was of the worst sort, and not half sufficient in quantity. Hundreds and thousands of poor mothers and their children were destitute of bread and even potatoes were to dear to be got at. The diet of these unfortunate creatures was oatmeal and water, and they had not enough even of that. Many actually perished for lack of sustenance.

While this was the sad condition of the working class, particularly in the manufacturing districts where myriads had been thrown wholly idle, or next to it, arising from stoppage of the export trade, and the inability of the home consumers to buy as much as they had done formerly, owing to their being so heavily taxed, the laws were barbarous in the extreme, quite so much so as they could ever be in Dahomey. Thus we have seen it stated that at Manchester, about the time we write of, a woman was tried and convicted of highway robbery, for taking some potatoes out of a cart in the street, and was hanged for it.

Thousands able and willing work compelled to have recourse to parochial relief for the support of themselves and families. At Nottingham, while the stagnation and distress were frightful, the parish overseers, hot being able to furnish the men with better employment, set them to clean and mend the roads. As might have been expected, these improvised scavengers hated that sort of work, and not being able to reach the real authors of their calamities and degradations, they turned their vengeance against their employers, to whose indifference to the well-being of the people under them they attributed the greater part of their misery. The factory system was still in its infancy, but was gradually extending over the land; and the large employment of new machines, for the lessening of hand labour and consequent cheapening of goods, coincident with the glut and stagnation caused by over-production, and non-intercourse with America as well as the Continent, roused the people to frenzy. It was these machines, they fancied, that did most of the mischief, and they therefore determined that the use of them should be given up.

The whole manhood left in the half-starved Nottingham stockingers, always a fierce set, seemed now to flow out in the breaking of stocking frames and other new-fangled appliances for doing away with hand labour. On the 11th of March, 1811, a large body of framework knitters assembled in the Market Place, and after working each other to a high degree of excitement, by a rehearsal of their unparalleled sufferings, and the alleged oppression which was committed upon them, by the several abatements which had lately taken place in the rate of wages, they expressed their determination to prevent any further restrictions, by taking prompt vengeance on those manufacturers who, they conceived, had been the most active in getting wages beaten down below the standard which men could keep body and soul together. The presence of the military saved the town for the nonce, but at Arnold, a village four miles off, the mob broke sixty three frames that very night, and rapidly did the mischievous contagion spread, that in less than three weeks at least 200 frames were broken to pieces in Nottingham and its immediate neighbourhood. Several persons were apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in these outrages; but no sufficient evidence could be got to warrant their detention. They were, therefore, to the great exhultation of their companions, uniformly ordered to be discharged. Several Bow Street officers were sent down from London, to secure, if possible, the apprehension of some of these nocturnal marauders, but without success. The Royal Lancashire Militia, who happened be on their way from Worcester to Hull, were detained in the town for several weeks, and while they remained things were pretty quiet.

But on the 4th November, the frame-breaking was renewed, with circumstances more alarming than in the spring. The outrages spread over the whole county of Notts, as well into the shires of Derby, Leicester, Lancashire, and York. The rioters styled themselves Luddites, from one Ned Ludd, an diot [*sic*] who had once broken some frames in a passion. The system pursued by them was to assemble, by a preconcerted arrangement, in parties of from six to sixty, according to the nature of the work to be done, under an acknowledged leader, styled General Ludd, who had the absolute command over them, and directed all their operations. Their place of destination being arrived at, and the object of their vengeance clearly pointed out, the guards, armed with swords, firelocks, and other offensive weapons were duly stationed in their proper places, with orders, at the peril of their lives, to allow no one to pass or to stir out of their houses. The pioneers, as they might be termed, were then ordered promptly to advance, enter or break in the door, as the case might be, and proceed to their work of demolition, which was generally but the task of a few minutes. This being completed, and the whole of the party reassembled, the leader called over the list of his men, who answered by a particular number, after which he discharged a pistol, as a signal that all was right, and then each one made his way from the scene of action, and got home as best could.

When the party about to be attacked had received timely notice of what was in store for him, as was sometimes the case, and had taken measures of defence, the assailants usually took care to come in such force, and so well armed, as to make resistance hopeless. In several such cases the guards sought safety in flight.

In an attack on the house of a person named Hollingworth, of Bullwell, who had rendered himself specially obnoxious to the workmen, and who, expecting a nightly attack, had engaged seven or eight men, armed with muskets, to protect his frames, the first man who forced his way into the house received a shot the abdomen, which in a few minutes deprived him of life. Before he expired, however, he exclaimed, "Proceed, my brave fellows; I die with a willing heart!" His companions conveyed the dead body to the borders of the forest, near which Hollingworth's house stood, and then with a fury irresistible by the force opposed to them, again attacked the house, and in about an hour and a half fully accomplished their object. The unfortunate leader of the attack turned out to be a man who had lived in the village of Arnold, and his dead body was removed thither for interment. The funeral scene was one of truly terrific character. From seven to eight hundred stockingers assembled in the graveyard. The excitement was tremendous, Yells, threats, denunciations, and cries for vengeance were heard on every side. The Riot Act was read amid conflicting shouts, and the military at last had to clear the churchyard, which they did fortunately, without shedding blood.

Scarcely a night passed after this that there were not violent outrages of some sort. The rioters extended their operations over the whole district, where they broke all frames employed in the making of *cut ups*, or worked either at reduced prices or by hands not regularly brought to the trade. The consequences were ruinous to many of the small frameworkers and others, who through fear were compelled to cease working, and have their machinery under military escort removed into the town as a place of security.

In the early part of December, the magistrates both of the town and county issued a notice calling upon all publicans to close their houses at 10 p.m., and directing further that all householders, their servants and dependants, should remain within doors after that hour, so long as the disposition to tumult, then prevalent, should continue. They also intimated that to enter a house in the night time, to demolish a frame, was in the eye of the law burglary, and punishable with death, and that all offenders would meet with the utmost severity. It was hoped, by the publication of this notice and the arrival of additional troops (the Royal Horse Guards Blue and the Berkshire Militia), that the outrages would have been checked, if not subdued. But this expectation proved illusive, for the Luddites only increased in boldness over the whole length' and breadth of the Midland hosiery district; and the frame-breaking went on without interruption during the month of December and into the January following.

On New Year's Day, 1812, universal distrust and gloom pervaded Nottingham. Wheat, at this time, was 108s per quarter, while every other article of domestic consumption, as tea, sugar, spices, &c. were double, and in some instances treble, their present prices; in addition to which, it may be added that the Income-tax, enforced with unsparing severity, was ten per cent, and all the assessed taxes on a similar scale. Our foreign trade had fallen off to the extent of about sixteen millions per annum, while the public expenditure had advanced seven millions upon the preceding year. Want and misery prevailed to an appalling degree; and in the desperation of their circumstances it was noways unnatuarl [*sic*] that the working men of Nottingham, and other manufacturing towns like it, should be led to view almost every man as their enemy whose position gave him opportunity of controlling wages to any extent. The seeds of a social war were thickly sown, and, as in the case of Gadmus's teeth, ready to start up in the shape of armed men, for mutual extermination. On this occasion, the destruction of the machines, by which alone that employment could be furnished which the people clamoured and fought for, was the mad means taken avenge themselves on their supposed oppressors. Everybody now sees that this was most unwise, but if true that "oppression will drive a wise man mad," it was not to be wondered at that the poor stockingers in the Midland Counties, at their wits' end how to live, should have been suddenly seized by this destructive frenzy.

To enumerate every instance of frame-breaking in Nottingham and the country round during the winter of 1811-12 would fill a good-sized volume. In Bailey's "Annals of Nottinghamshire" there are long details of some of the more flagrant cases. The utmost daring was shown by the mischief makers, who usually assembled soon after nightfall, with their faces blackened, and armed with lethal implements, and proceeded to the houses of those who were obnoxious to them, and posting guards round about to prevent a surprise, and then wreaking their vengeance in the most deliberate way. The town was meanwhile strongly garrisoned by soldiers, and the authorities were all on the alert. But though the place was literally as if in a state of siege, and a secret committee was sitting in permanence, invested with a discretionary power to expend any sum not exceeding £2,000, for the purpose of obtaining such information as might be useful in bringing the rioters to punishment, and suppressing the disturbances, all seemed to be unavailing. Nothing could penetrate the mystery of "Luddism," nor break the bond of union which bound its devotees together. In spite of all their errors and all their crimes, therefore, it is impossible to withhold admiration from the stern integrity of purpose which thus led a number of poor men to withstand the tempting bribes of from a hundred to three hundred guineas, and in one instance five hundred to turn informants against their fellows.

The following letter from Nottingham, dated the 12th December, 1811, and printed in the *Gentleman's Magazine*, gives an account of these disturbances, which we deem worth quoting:—

"The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has parallel in its history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. These truly alarming tumults had origin in a complaint exhibited by the stocking-makers against some of the hosiers, on account of the latter abating the fashioning price of making some descriptions of stockings, and causing others, along with sandals, socks, caps, &c., to be cut out of pieces, in like manner as a tailor cuts garment; and the stockings, &c., thus made, were not only deprived of their proper loopy selvages, which are the grace, the ornament, and natural guarantee to the real value of the framework knitted stockings, but, many more could produced in any given time than could be of those properly fashioned, the wages of the workmen and the work itself were daily on the decline, as was also the credit of the trade. And if we add to these causes of complaint, the constant advancement in the price of every article necessary to human subsistence, the true causes of these disturbances will be found. The object of the workmen has been to destroy those machines, or frames, they are called in the dialect of the trade, that were employed in the making of pieces to be cut up into stockings, &c.; and indiscriminately by those belonging to the hosiers, who had rendered their names obnoxious by giving reduced prices. Day after day have the magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil power, and called in additional aid of the military but, hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail; mysterious organisation has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. The rioters appear suddenly in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of whom, be whomsoever may, is styled General Ludd; and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of a monarch; indeed, it is well understood, that disobedience to his command is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organised band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already been inflicted, by the burning of hay-stacks, &c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and few of the depredators apprehended."

Up to the close of 1611 [*sic*], about 700 frames costing from £16 to £120 each, had been destroyed.

OLD STORIES RETOLD. THE LUDDITES.

The town was, as already said, full of military — between 800 and 900 cavalry and 1,000 infantry, in addition to the local civil and military force — a larger force, it was admitted in Parliament, than had ever before been found necessary, at any period of our history, to be employed in the quelling of a merely local disturbance. Yet all, as we have seen, was insufficient for the purpose. Indeed, the officers and soldiers, as is too often the case, were not the best sort of men to conciliate and pacify disaffected people. On the contrary, their conduct rather irritated than soothed those they were sent down amongst to preserve the King's peace. Thus the theatre had to be abruptly closed, by order of the magistrates, in consequence of tumultuous proceedings that took place there on several successive evenings. Some red-coated worthies were in the habit, it seems, of coming in quite sober, of course, at half-price, and as soon the curtain fell, of vociferating "God save the King!" and those who did not instantly obey their second imperious mandate, which was "Hats off!" were assailed with oaths, sticks, swords, &c. The stockingers, who were all what would have been called red-hot Radicals, had that term then been in use, naturally resented this military dictation. The cry of the drunken officers was answered by one of "Millions, be free!" and the people rose with their hats on. A free exchange of blows was to be looked for after this; it would have been miraculous had there not been a row; both sides equally enjoyed the fun; and both got their heart's fill of kicks and cuffs, and bufferings and bruises. Some of the Radicals got smart blows with the officers' canes in the pit and boxes of the theatre; and some of the officers got still smarter ones in the street after they had left the house, from the bludgeons the mob. In short, the people of Nottingham, particularly "the gods," conceived that no person had any right to order them to stand up and take off their hats, at the word of command, when a particular tune was played, either in the theatre or any where else. And the noisy loyalty of the militia officers, far from inclining the "fierce democratic" to more courteous behaviour, only tended to embitter them still more against all constituted authority, arbitrary, tyrannical, and wantonly oppressive.

On the 6th February, 1812, Mr Whitbread brought the subject of the riots at Nottingham under the consideration of the House of Commons, and inquired if Ministers were prepared to go into investigation of the subject. Eight days later, Mr Ryder, the Home Secretary, moved for leave to bring in bills "for more exemplary punishing persons found guilty destroying stocking and lace frames," &c. To the penal clauses of this bill, which made the of framebreaking, whether by day or night, till the 1st March, 1814, an offence punishable with death, some show of opposition was made in both Houses of Parliament, but it was ultimately carried and received the Royal assent. It was far beyond the wisdom of the Legislature, of course to devise any scheme for the abatement of that misery under which the people groaned, or the amelioration of those laws the injustice of which they complained of. All that it could undertake was to visit them with Draconian pains and endeavour to crush, their free, independent spirit, by depriving them of the right to carry arms for their own defence, which it had always been supposed was an Englishman's privilege. To suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, and place the disturbed districts under Martial Law, was the approved catholicon of Lord Castlereagh and his colleagues, and their proposal to that effect met with but feeble resistance from the Whigs, whose Liberalism was more of a profession than principle.

At the Lent Assizes, which took place previous to the new penal Act coming into force, a number of men, some of them mere youths, were found guilty of being concerned in breaking frames, and sentenced to seven and fourteen years' transportation. Some of these convicts got on well in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, and died possessed of considerable property, a thing which they were very unlikely to have done had they not been sent across the seas, for their own as well as their country's good.

Adding a new capital crime to our already sufficiently barbarous code was not the likeliest or best means, as events soon showed, of deterring the stockingers from acts of violence; for on the night of the 27th of April an extensive manufacturer and hosier in the town of Nottingham, named Trentham, was shot at while standing in the porch at his own house door, and wounded very severely. Rewards to the amount of six hundred pounds were offered for the discovery of the assassins, who were two in number, but in vain. For though it was almost certain that several persons were privy to the plot, and though strong suspicion fell on two desperate fellows, known to be connected with Luddism, yet nothing came out to incriminate them.

What may be termed sporadic cases of frame-breaking took place at intervals during the ensuing summer and autumn, and likewise in the following year, but nothing particularly calling for notice occurred till the evening of the 14th October, 1813, when a desperate affray took place between a strong party of police officers stationed in house at Basford, to protect an informer named Garton from threatened violence, and a numerous band of Luddites armed with pistols, who broke into the place in search of their man, but were driven out after some smart firing, leaving their leader, afterwards ascertained to be a very intelligent but hot-headed man named Samuel Bamford, dead on the parlour floor, one of the officers having shot him with a blunderbuss. Bamford had been the pet companion of a man named Towle, who had been apprehended on Garton's information. He was a man of small stature, but with courage and energy sufficient enough to qualify him for enterprises of the most hazardous kind. Under more favourable circumstances he might have writ his name in his country's annale, by the side of Moore, Wolfe, Nelson, and Wellington.

On their precipitate retreat from Garton's house after their leader's death, the Luddites shot through the head respectable framework knitter, named Kilby, who, hearing the affray, had ventured to open his front door, and look out to see what was going on.

In Bamford's case, a verdict of "Justifiable homicide" was returned; in Kilby's, one of "Wilful murder by some person or persons unknown." Large rewards were offered for the discovery of the perpetrators of the outrage, but the guilty individuals, and their associates, kept their own counsel.

The Luddite conspiracy, if it may be termed such, extended far beyond the confines of Nottinghamshire. In the counties of Lancaster, York, Derby, &c., similar disturbances occurred of more or less serious character. Threatening letters were written. Houses were set fire to. Sums of money were demanded and extorted. Arms were carried off. Machinery was broken. This seemed not to be the effect of any sudden impulse, but of an organised system of violence. The stimulus, however, was everywhere the same—hunger, enforced idleness, and hatred of the upper classes, owing to the idea that they were all banded together to oppress the poor working man. But there was no evidence to prove any political plot, no agitators among persons in the higher ranks, no open blatant demagogy, like a Kenealy's. It was a spontaneous movement of the people's'own, arising solely from the dearness of provisions and other causes of distress, aggravated by the conviction, to some extent well founded, that the Government and its supporters had very much to do with bringing that distress about, and intensified it while it lasted.

A special commission was issued for the trial of some Luddite gangs in Yorkshire, and opened by Baron Thompson, at York, on the 4th of January, 1813. The jury having found twenty-one of the men guilty of administering illegal oaths, riotously assembling, destroying the frames and looms of manufacturers of hosiery, lace and cloth, breaking into houses and robbery, fifteen of them were sentenced to suffer death, and six to be transported for seven years. The fifteen were all hanged at the same time, "in terrorem of others." Sixteen others, less deeply implicated, were discharged on bail, and fifteen, against whom nothing could be proved, were discharged without bail.

On the same occasion, George Mellor, of Longroyd Bridge, William Thorp, and Thomas Smith, of Huddersfield, were indicted for the wilful murder of William Horsfield [*sic*], of Marsden, merchant and manufacturer, at Lockwood, in the West Riding. Benjamin Walker, an accomplice, gave evidence against them. Horsfell had made himself obnoxious to the Luddites, through his being the possessor of a set of shears, which they found they could not get at to break, and therefore they determined to shoot him. They were all three found guilty and hanged.

At the Peace of 1814 new life seemed to be given to these disgraceful trade outrages, which accordingly, after a lull of a few months, broke out again worse than ever. In all the counties already named, numerous bodies of unemployed artisans committed great excesses. In Yorkshire several mills were burned down. At Huddersfield a great number of armed men, with their faces disguised by broad black marks down each cheek and over the forehead, broke into several houses, threatening the inmates with immediate death if they stirred a foot, ransacked all the drawers, and carried off whatever sums of money they found. At Sheffield similar outrages took place. At Stafford the Luddites, from eighty to a hundred strong, broke into houses in search of arms, and after getting what they wanted, left the inmates in a state of terror. At New Radford, near Nottingham, on the morning of the 16th of June, 1816, a fierce attack was made by strong party on the premises of a Mr Wright, and twelve valuable point-net lace machines were broken, in retaliation for the real supposed infringement of some trade regulations. Some of the party were apprehended and tried. Intense excitement thereupon prevailed. The prisoners seemed to have the entire sympathy of their class. The principal ground of defence was an *alibi*, but their safety lay in the court being intimidated. The result was a verdict of acquittal, in the absence of direct and positive proof of guilt. Had it been otherwise, both judge and jury would in all likelihood have been murdered, as the mob, well armed, had complete possession of the court room for hours, and during the progress of the trial and summing up of judge, expressions were given loud utterance to of the most fearful import. When the verdict was announced, the whole place rang again with loud cheers, which were taken by the crowd in the street, and reverberated to the sky. 

On the 20th of November, in the same year, James Towle, stocking-maker, a leading man among the Luddites, was executed at Leicester for the crime of frame-breaking. The offence for which he suffered was committed at Loughborough. Towle had been carefully brought up by honest and industrious parents, who, though in humble life, sent him to one of the best day schools in Nottingham, where he was a schoolfellow with Henry Kirk White. He died like Martyr going to glory.

The Watch and Ward Act was enforced in Nottingham, on and after the 2nd December, 1801, the continued outrages rendering such a step necessary for the protection of life and property, neither the constabulary nor the military being found sufficient. The distress caused by the great changes of employment consequent on the sudden return to peace after twenty years of war, and the disbanding of the immense forces employed so long at sea and on land, had brought about a rapid increase of serious crimes, and the common people having got it into their heads that in every case of class difference or dispute the law was in the wrong, disaffection spread over the land to its utmost borders.

On the 31st of March and 1st of April, 1817, eight men, named respectively Clarke, Savidge, Withers, Amos, Crowther, Mitchell, Towle and Watson, were convicted at Leicester of being concerned in an attempt to shoot a man, named Asher, at Loughborough. Two accomplices, named Blackborne and Burton, were the chief witnesses against them. Blackborne acknowledged that it was himself who fired at Asher, but all his accomplices, except Clark and Watson, who were repreaved, suffered death, while the traitor got off. On the scaffold these men conducted themselves with a firmness seldom witnessed on such a melancholy occasion. They were all tall, well-made, well-dressed, fine-looking fellows, seeming worthy of a better fate. A troop of hussars were in attendance, as well as the yeomanry cavalry, in case any attempt at rescue or disorder should have been made. Happily the whole passed over without interruption. The bodies of the victims, after being cut down, were placed in shells, and put into two carts, in which they were taken for interment to Nottingham, to which neighbourhood they all belonged. The funerals were most affecting scenes.

Nothing, we are told, could exceed the consternation felt in Nottingham upon the fact, first transpiring that such men as Savidge, Mitchell, Crowther, and some others, had been the leading perpetrators of the murders by which Luddism had latterly become distinguished, for they had all been well brought up, and each received a decent education, and were always looked upon, by society in general, as respectable, well-conducted individuals.

The last executions we find on record directly connected with Luddism are those of three men named Brandreth, Turner, and Ludlow, who suffered the last penalty of the law at Derby, on the 7th November, 1817, having been convicted of high treason at a special commission held there on the 15th October previous. Twenty-three Luddites altogether were tried on that occasion, while the bills against twelve were thrown out by the Grand Jury. Several of those convicted were reprieved.

The Luddites were charged with setting fire to Belvoir Castle, though there was not the slightest proof that they had done it. That splendid place, the seat of the Duke of Rutland, was more than half burned down, on the 16th of October 1816, with much plate and many paintings, including "The Nativity," by Sir Joshua Reynolds, valued at three thousand guineas. How the fire originated was, we believe, never known, but most likely it was accidental.

Cobbett wrote several powerful letters to the Luddites, in his *Political Register* for 1816, warning them against the commission of those acts by which they had made themselves infamous, and which he truly told them was not unlikely to throw back the cause of freedom in this country for ever so long. As to their employers, he endeavoured to show them that those circumstances which appeared to them to have arisen from their avarice, had, in fact, arisen from their want of the means, more than from their want of inclination, to afford the people who worked for them competence in exchange for their labours, He demonstrated that their notions hostile to machinery were the result of thoughtlessness; that machinery was not evil, but an advantage; that the labour saved by its use was always available for some better purpose; and that, if the powerful assistance of the wind and water, and steam and clockwork, were thrown aside, we should soon find ourselves making a rapid progress towards the feebleness of savage life. It was heavy taxation, not machinery, he said, that was at the root of their grievances. It was the enormous price the nation was paying for wicked war. It was the sum taken from those who laboured, whether with head or hands, to be given to those who did not labour, which had mainly caused the misery. There can be little doubt but these letters of Cobbett's, animated as they were by good sound sense and kindly feeling, did much to exorcise the evil spirit of machine breaking, as well to spread truer notions of political economy among the working men of the Midland Counties.

A few years earlier, in 1867, a retelling of the tale of the Yorkshire Luddites appeared in *All the Year Round*, a literary journal founded and edited by Charles Dickens, and the *Leeds Times*. In part, a "local authority" is quoted in the article, although without a full citation.

AN OLD STORY RETOLD  
THE LUDDITES

The Luddite rioters of Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire derive their name from General Lud, their mythical leader, that awe-striking name and title being, however, borne by several of their chiefs at different times and in different districts. The deplorable outrages committed by these men—the breaking into houses to seize fire-arms and obtain money for the purposes of their mischievous and dangerous association—lasted for nearly forty years, during which time, with the exception of a few lulls, the great manufacturing districts were in as disturbed and lawless a state as the Border country when such marauders as Hard-Riding Dick and William of Deloraine drove honest men's cattle, burned keep-towers, and harried farm-houses.

All social diseases have their climax. The night, they say, is darkest just before daybreak. To all miseries and misfortunes there is a culminating period. It was in 1812 that the Luddists were fiercest, maddest, and most desperate, deriding all Philosophy and forgetting all the tenets of political economy in the fierceness of their indignation. Their object was to destroy the new frames which about the end of the last century were introduced (" with, power") to finish woollen goods. Up to this time, cloth had been finished by a tedious and costly process, a man being required to each machine, and three times the expense being incurred. The machine was a ponderous unsightly instrument, square at the extremity of the blade, but otherwise not unlike the shears used by sheep-shearers, One blade was passed under the balk cloth to be finished, and the other over it, the latter cropping off the nap of the wool as the blades were dexterously pushed, backwards and forwards by the workmen. The men engaged in this primitive occupation were known by the name of Croppers. The process was as much behind the age as the Hottentot system of spinning is behind the latest processes of Manchester. The croppers, whose occupation was thus interfered with, became as violent as the silversmiths of Ephesus, and were the chief leaders in the Luddite riots. They were generally of the stubborn resolute Yorkshire race; ignorant, violent, determined, holding together for good or ill, and resolved to destroy the new frames, which they believed would throw poor men out of work and starve their families.

There is a wild old Yorkshire legend extant, which pretty well proves the opinion entertained of the croppers by their contemporaries. We give it in the words of a most reliable authority: "The tradition is, that in consequence of their dissipated and wicked ways, all the croppers at their departure hence went to a certain place, that—to describe it negatively—was neither purgatory nor paradise, and that in the course of time they became so numerous in that particularly warm region, and withal so very, very unruly, that the devil was at his wits' end what to do with them, and had no pleasure of his existence in their company. Get rid of them he could not. There they were, and, notwithstanding all remonstrances, declared that they would neither depart nor yet mend their manners. One day, while pondering upon his difficult position, a brilliant idea suddenly occurred to his Satanic Majesty. He knew the fondness of the croppers when on earth for ale, whether good, bad, or indifferent, so he, went to the door of the infernal regions, and bawled out with all his might, 'Ale! ale! ale!' The effect was magical. At the joyful sound the croppers were instantaneously seized with a burning thirst. They rushed out to a man helter-skelter to where the delightful news came from. No sooner were they safely out than Satan quietly but quickly slipped in, banging the door to and locking it after him, shouting through the keyhole to the astonished and deluded croppers outside, 'Now, d——n you, I have got you out, and I'll keep you out, and I'll take good care no more croppers ever come in here!' And this is stated to be the reason that from thenceforth no more croppers entered the infernal regions."

No Ribbonmen ever banded together with more sullen determination in their movements; their drilling and their attacks were conducted with military precision. Mere agricultural labourers might have shown as much courage, but could not have formed such subtle combinations. Every man had his allotted place by number (as in a regiment) in the musket, pistol, or hatchet, companies. The form of initiation was known by the local name of "twisting in." The oath taken was as solemn and terrible as that used in the secret tribunals of the middle ages. It was as follows:—"I, ——— ———, of my own voluntary will, do declare and solemnly swear that I never will reveal to any person or persons under the canopy of heaven the names of the persons who compose this secret committee, their proceedings, meetings, places of abode, dress, features, connexions, or anything else that might lead to a discovery of the same either by word, or deed, or sign, under the penalty of being sent out of the world by the first brother who shall meet me, and my name and character blotted out of existence, and never to be remembered but with contempt and abhorrence; and I further now do swear, that I will use my best endeavours to punish by death any traitor or traitors, should any rise up amongst us, wherever I can_find him or them; and though he should fly to the verge of nature, I will pursue him with unceasing vengeance. So help me, God, and bless me to keep this my oath inviolable."

At the time of the crisis of disorder in 1812, when the Luddite conspiracy was netting over the greater part of two counties, Enoch and James Taylor constructed the obnoxious frames in their smithy, which stood on what is now the play-ground of the town school at Marsden. These enterprising men had begun life as common blacksmiths, but by industry, perseverance, and inventive genius, had become known as skilful machine makers. The giant hammer used in the Yorkshire smithies was in 1812 playfully known among the grimy artisans who wielded it, as "Enoch," and when the Luddites made one of their midnight marches to destroy a finishing frame, the cant saying was—alluding to the firm at Marsden and the hammer that was to crush their work,—

"Enoch made them, and Enoch shall break them."

Suffering, and believing that they would suffer more, these impetuous men totally forgot that all improvements in a trade tend to enlarge that trade; that all lessenings of cost in the production of a fabric tend to increase the sale of that fabric; and that if the finishing-machines reduced the number of croppers, the manufacture of them undoubtedly led to the employment of more hammermen. To these truths they were indifferent; all they knew, was, that the new frames lessened the immediate work for the croppers, and they were determined not merely to destroy those already in use, but to terrify employers from further adopting them.

Yet the croppers themselves, as long as they could get work, were well-to-do men, their wages being twenty-four shillings a week. The Marsden people were, indeed, seldom in distress, for the great cotton trade was already developing, and warp and weft ready for the hand-loom were brought from Lancashire fortnightly and put out to Marsden weavers. But let us be just; the times were hard everywhere, and a shilling did not bring then what it had brought before, and what it brings now. Men worked week in and week out, and only just, after all, kept the wolf from the door. Oh! there was a sharp biting suffering, before thoughtful working men could combine in that thirty years' conspiracy that brought many brave lads to the gallows, and sent many to pine away the rest of their miserable and wasted lives in the dismal restrictions of New South Wales. Time is full of common sense; it brings men to the truth; yet for nearly a whole generation it never stopped these disturbances, erroneous as they were. The man who thinks that the troubles indicated no foregone misery and wrong, would call a dying man's groans and screams mere practical jokes.

The Yorkshire nature is staunch and dogged; it was not going to bear starvation quietly, while proud, arrogant, and often cruel manufacturers were fattening on the very flesh and blood of the workman and his pining children. The poor man had borne the contemptuous denial of his rights, the incessant suspension of the laws of the land, trade monopolies, tyrannical, stupid, and heartless governments, civil and religious disabilities, and unjust and useless ways; but dear bread — that was the last straw that broke the camel's back. The artisan saw only in the new machinery means to still further enrich his oppressors and starve himself. When the rich man can be weary of life, is it to be wondered at that the poor man finds life sometimes intolerable? The panacea seemed to be combination. General Lud got recruits in Derbyshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Nottinghamshire, and especially the south-western districts of Yorkshire. There were food riots at Sheffield, Mansfield, and Macclesfield. Food riots are as certain a proof of something wrong in the body politic, as certain pustules are proofs of small-pox. The stocking-weavers in Nottinghamshire began the bad work by holding nocturnal meetings, by forming secret societies, by appointing delegates and local "centres," by extracting black mail from manufacturers, and requiring implicit obedience in their adherents, after administering an oath. From shattering frames, the Yorkshire men began to talk of upsetting the government, Religion was even pressed into the rioters' service, and a crusading spirit inculcated on those who joined the Luddites. The disorders came to a head in 1812, partly from the lenity shown to Luddite Prisoners at the Nottingham Assizes in March, and especially by the dreadful price which provisions had then reached. The poor hardly ever tasted nourishing flesh-making wheaten bread; tea and coffee were almost unknown; clothing was extravagantly dear; and the workman had to gain strength for the twelve hours' toil in the bad atmosphere of a mill, from a paltry meal of porridge. All this was hard to bear even with freedom; but it was intolerable in a country where the intellect and conscience of the nation were enslaved, and where the poor had no other privilege than that of paying am undue share of the taxes levied on them by an enormously wealthy intolerably selfish landed interest.

The riots soon overran the West Riding, beginning at Marsden. After trying their destructive powers on a small scale there, the frames at Woodbottom and Ottiwells were marked out for destruction, and the lives of their owners, the Armitages and the Horsfalls, were threatened. These gentlemen took prompt and energetic measures for the protection of their property. A bridge over the river at the Woodbottom Mill had an iron gate placed across the centre which could be securely fastened against all invaders. It had iron spikes at the top, and a row of iron spikes down each side. This bridge—with its gateway and protecting spikes—remained in its original integrity until a very recent day.

"At Ottiwells," adds a local authority, "at the upper end of the road fronting the mill, and on an elevation, level with the present dam, a cannon was planted behind a wall pierced with openings three feet high and ten inches wide. Through these apertures the cannon could be pointed so as to command the entire frontage of the mill, and fired upon an approaching enemy. This somewhat primitive battery still exists, but the artillery disappeared long ago; and though now walled up, the outlines of the embrasures formerly left for the cannon to be discharged through, may yet be distinctly discerned, In addition to these means of defence, the workmen employed at the mills were armed, and kept watch and ward during the night."

Mr. Horsfall, resolute and prompt, was not to be easily frightened, and the Marsden croppers were none of them Luddites. The inhabitants of Marsden and the surrounding villages were also compelled to deliver up all fire-arms in their possession, until the reign of terror should pass away.

There were also infantry and cavalry in Marsden. The 10th King's Bays, the 15th Hussars, and the Scotch Greys, were alternately billeted (at quite inadequate rates) in the town, impoverishing and sometimes ruining the landlords, irritating the high-spirited, oppressing the neutral, and contaminating the whole neighbourhood. These regiments were not allowed to remain long in one place, for fear of the men becoming tainted with Luddite opinions. The soldiers marched every night to the market-place at Marsden, and, having been paraded, were then told off into two divisions, the one to patrol on the road to Ottiwells and Valeside, and the other to spend the night between Marsden, Woodbottom Mill, and Lingards. As their movements were well known, and the clash of their swords and the tramp of their horses' feet were to he heard at a long distance at night, it was easy for the Luddites to steal away behind hedges, crouch in plantations, or take by-roads to their work of destruction The cats had belled themselves this time, and the mice could play as they liked. On the 11th of April fire was set to the gunpowder lying above the West Riding. On that day, the croppers at Mr. Wood's mill at Longroyd Bridge, near Huddersfield, were planning a night attack on the mill of a Mr. Cartwright, at Liversedge. The leading conspirator was an impetuous cropper, named George Mellor (twenty-two). His chief lieutenants were Thomas Smith (twenty-three), William Thorpe (twenty-two), and a mean subtle fellow, afterwards an informer, Benjamin Walker (twenty-five). Joshua Dickenson, a cropper, came to the shop on the Saturday before named, and brought a pint of powder, a bag of bullets, and two or three cartridges, to distribute among the Longroyd Mill men. They met at night, about ten o'clock, when it was not quite dark, about three miles from Cartwright's mill, in the fields of Sir George Armitage, at the obelisk (or, as the Luddites quaintly nick-named it, "the dumb steeple"). When more than a hundred men had assembled, Mellor and' Thorpe, the two young leaders, mustered the Luds, and called them over, not by names, but by numbers, in military fashion; there were three companies—the musket, the pistol, and the hatchet companies; the rest carried sledge-hammers, adzes, and bludgeons. They were formed in lines two deep, and William Hale (No. 7), a cropper from Longroyd Mill, and a man named Rigge, were ordered by Mellor to go last and drive the Luds up, and see that no coward stole off in the darkness; for there were many Luds who only joined through fear of being assassinated, and had no heart in the matter. The order to march was at last given, and the band proceeded over wild Hartshead Moor, and from thence into a close sixty yards from Rawfold Mill, where the musket-men put on masks, got ready their fire-arms, and took a draught of rum to cheer them on to the attack. Mellor then formed his company of musketmen into lines of thirteen abreast, and moved on to the doomed mill, followed by Thorpe and his pistol-men.

In the meantime, Mr. Cartwright, who had apprehensions of an attack, was in the great stone many-windowed building. The great waterwheels were still; the only sound was the ripple of the water in the mill-dam. The alarm-bell, rising above the roof, stood out dark against the sky. There was no light at any window, and no noise. The five workmen and their allies, the five soldiers, were asleep. The armed men, intent on destruction and ready for murder to their design stole on like ghosts. Soon after twelve, Mr. Cartwright, who had just fallen asleep, was awoke by the violent barking of a large dog kept chained inside the mill for such a purpose.

The millowner leaps out of bed to give the alarm, and as he opens his bed-room door he hears twenty or thirty of the three hundred panes of glass on the ground floor shattered in; at the same time there is a rattle and blaze of musketry at the ground and upper windows; the bullets whistle, and splinter, and flatten against the inner walls. At the same time a score of sledge-hammers are heard working at the chief door, and voices shouting and threatening at the other entrances, and indeed on all sides, except that on which the mill-pool lies.

The hour is come at last. But Mr Cartwright is Yorkshire too, resolute, bold, and of a good heart. He shouts to his men, and they fly to arms, and load and cock their muskets. He and one or two of his workpeople run to the alarm-bell and pull fiercely at the rope, till it clashes out its summons to the Hussars at Liversedge and friends near or far.

This drives the Luddites stark staring mad; the firing becomes hotter; and a dozen of them cry out:

"Fire at the bell-rope!" "Shoot away the bell!" "D——— that bell! get it, lads!"

(For they knew the soldiers would be on them with their sabres if that bell clang many minutes longer.) Presently the bell-rope breaks, and two mep are sent up to ring and fire alternatively. Cartwright and his men fire from the upper loops of the mill obliquely at the howling crowd that flash off their guns, and ply their hammers, and snap their pistols at the detested mill, where the ten men are glaring at them from under covert. The fire from and against the mill is hot, pelting, and furious.

"Bring up Enoch!" roar stentorian voices.

A big hammerman advances to the door, and pounds at it with Enoch as if it were a block of iron.

The rest shout:

"Bang up, my lads!" "In with you!" "Are you in, my lads?" "Keep close." "In with you, lads!" "D——— them. Kill them, every one!"

Mellor then cries, with horrible imprecations, "The door is opened!"

But it is not. They are wrong this time. Enoch has been hard and heavy at it; it is true, the panels are broken, so that a man's head might go through, but the lock and bolt are not burst yet. The planks are split with hatchets, the malls have broken and chopped it into holes, but the door still keeps faithful and fast. The stone jambs of one entrance are wrenched out, the frameworks are smashed in; still Cartwright and his men keep up their fire from between the flagstones that barricade the upper windows, and some of the Luddites are struck. There is a cry that some one is shot, and a man has fallen on his face. Booth is down, and there is hot blood on Dean's hands. Dean has been shot through the door as he plied his hatchet.

There are only nine panes of glass left in the ground floor; but Enoch has failed this time. The firing has now gone on for twenty minutes, and still flashes to and fro over the mill-pool, from door to window, and from window to door. A man named Walker is looking in at a broken window, when a ball from one of Cartwright's men strikes the edge of his hat. The enraged Luddite instantly leans in and fires at where the flash came from, taking the best aim he can. As he said afterwards :

"I was determined to do it, though my hand was shot off for it, and hand and pistol had gone into the mill."

It is very dark, nothing can be seen on either side but the jet of fire upwards and downwards as the besieged fire from behind the pavings stones, and the Luddites from their platoons.

But now from the clamorous crowd outside came groans and screams; and the mob, either intimidated, dreading the coming sabres, or falling short of powder and ball, began to slacken their fire. That gave the mill people fresh courage, for they knew the Luddites were losing heart. Now the firing entirely ceased, except a shot or two at intervals. The wounded men were groaning with pain, and their comrades were trying to carry them off. The Luddites broke and separated towards Huddersfield; one man fell in the mill dam, others slunk back to the Dumb Steeple Field; a few crept up the beck.

Mr. Cartwright, listening, could hear the heavy groaning of the poor wretches left under the windows wounded, but he was afraid to go out lest it should be afterwards said he had murdered the stragglers in cold blood. Then, the victorious defenders rested and rejoiced, or kept the alarm bell going. On a friend arriving, Cartwright went cautiously out and examined the field of battle, and removed the wounded men to a public-house near. "When the day broke, Cartwright went and examined the ruined mill-- the windows were destroyed, the doors chopped and broken, the paths to Huddersfield strewn with malls, hatchets, and hammers. There was a Luddite's hat floating in a dismal way about the mill dam.

That night many glimpses were obtained of the retreating rioters.

Some of the frightened Luddites were soon tracked. On the night of the attack on Rawfold Mill, a man named Brooks, who was wet through and without a hat, called at High town on a man named Naylor, from whom Mellor, the leading spirit all through this bad affair, borrowed a hat for his coadjutor. On the day after, a woman living at Lockwood saw a great many cloth-dressers come to the house of a man named Brook, whom she heard evidently telling "some sorrowful tale." She could tell that, by the motion of his hand. She heard only a few words, and those were:

"That of all the dismallest dins anybody ever heard, that was the dismallest, and that you might have heard it half a mile, and I had rather be clemmed to death than be in such a stir again."

Before any of the men could be arrested the irritation produced by the failure of the attack on Rawfold's mill had led to a fresh crime. A day or two after the repulse the croppers at Mr. Wood's mill at Longroyd Bridge were talking together, lamenting the loss of life among the Luddites at Cartwright's mill. Mellor, always foremost, then said there was no way of smashing the machinery but by shooting the masters. No one present seems to have protested against this proposition. Mellor, who had been to Russia, had brought back with him a large pistol of a peculiar kind, with a barrel half a yard long. It had been sold to a man named Hall for some pigeons. This pistol was borrowed on the afternoon of the 28th of April. At Hall's house Mellor loaded this pistol so heavily that Hall asked Mellor if he meant to fire that? He thought the piece would jump back. Mellor replied, coolly, "Yes; I mean to give Horsfall that." About five o'clock that day Mellor came into a room at Longroyd Mill, where a man named Walker was at work with three other men, and asked him to go with him and shoot Mr. Horsfall. The man did not then consent; but half an hour after Mellor came again, put a loaded and primed pistol into his hand, and told him he must go with him and shoot Horsfall. Walker examined the pistol, found it nearly full, and consented.

This Mr. Horsfall—the man whom the four Luddites waited for in the narrow strip of a plantation on the Huddersfield road—was an excitable impetuous man, violent in manner, but kind and forgiving to his own workpeople. Against the Luddites, however, he was always implacable. Though he had offered to his neighbours, the Armitages, to pull down the obnoxious frames, he had been heard to express his wish to ride up to the saddlegirths in Luddite blood. The children, as he rode through Lingard's Wood, used to run out and cry, "I'm General Lud!" and he would invariably pursue the urchins with his horsewhip. This rash and impulsive man was about forty, and in the full flush of vigorous manhood. It was said that the Luddites had, on the night of the defeat at Rawfold's, tossed up a shilling to settle whether Cartwright's mill or Horsfall's mill should be first attacked.

The other men were in a wood twenty yards nearer Huddersfield. They were to fire after Mellor and Thorpe had fired.

This was at about six o'clock. At about half-past five Mr. Horsfall has mounted at the door of the George Hotel, Huddersfield, rash and defiant as usual, and ridden off. A few minutes after he was out of sight, Mr Horsfall's friend, a Mr. Eastwood, of Slaithwaite, who had often expostulated with the daring and obnoxious millowner on the imprudence of his intemperate language about the Luddites, called at the George to propose, for protection and companionship, to ride home with him. On hearing he had gone, he cantered quickly after him, hoping to overtake him. About six, Mr. Horsfall pulled up his horse at the Warren House Inn, at Crossland Moor. Finding there two of his old workpeople, Mr. Horsfall gave each a glass of liquor in a friendly way. He did not himself alight, but on the saddle tossed off a steaming glass of rum-and-water, and then rode off flushed with the grog. A man named Parr was about a hundred and fifty yards behind him. All the way from Huddersfield there had been an intermittent stream of people returning homeward—farmers in gigs, labourers with carts, and young squires riding gaily back to their country places.

When Mr. Horsfall comes abreast of the plantation, Parr sees four men in dark-coloured clothes stooping about under the boughs. All at once there comes a crack, as of a gun, and a puff of smoke. Mr. Horsfall's horse jibs around, and the rider falls with his face on the horse's neck. Two shots had been fired. By a great effort the wounded man raises himself painfully up by the horse's mane, and calls out "Murder!" At that moment a man in a bottle-green top-coat (one of the four in ambuscade) springs on the wall with one hand and both feet.

Parr riding up, seeing this, called out to the murderer "What, are you not contented yet?" and rode fast up to the wounded man, who was already dripping with blood. Horslall said to the farmer coming so providentially to his assistance:

"Good man, you are a stranger to me, but pray ride on to Mr. Horsfall's house (his brother's), and get assistance. I am shot."

Parr, supporting him in his arms—for he grew sick and faint, and was falling—said :

"Are you Mr. Horsfall, of Marsden?"

As he groaned "I am", the blood spurted from his side, and he fell off his horse.

Parr then drew him to the side of the road, and a clothier named Bannister supported him in his arms till two boys came up with a cart and removed the dying man to the Warren House.

When the surgeon came, he found poor Horsfall's pulse weak, faint, and tremulous, and he was pale and sick. One ball had passed through his left side to his right side, and nearly cut the femoral artery. The other ball had pierced his left thigh. He died in about thirty-eight hours.

A labourer in the adjacent fields, who saw the murder perpetrated, was seized with terror, and fled. Another man, ignorant of the murder, saw four men run and clamber over a wall into Dungeon Wood. In getting over the bars, part of a pistol was seen under one of the men's coat, and the ploughman said to himself :

"There go Luds; we shall have mischief to-night!"

The man (probably Mellor), seeing the pistol was observed, drew his top-coat down over it. Smith and Walker hid their pistols in two ant-hills in the wood, and also Mellor's powder-horn. Mellor and Thorpe then ordered their companions to go Honley way, and gave them two shillings to buy beer. They went on two miles further to Honley, and there drank seven or eight pints of ale. There was a drunken collier there, and the collier, pleased with Smith's excellent whistling, got up and tried to dance. Soon after, some pale frightened men came in from Huddersfield market, and brought word that Mr. Horsfall had been shot, and was lying half-dead at the Warren House.

The next day Walker was sent for by Mellor to come into his shop at Longroyd Mill. Mellor, Thorpe, and Smith then produced a Bible, and ordered him to kiss it, and swear to keep the secret "in all its circumstances." Six other workmen had already been sworn. Mellor had burnt his finger in firing, and it was then bound up, while Thorpe's face had been scratched in running through the plantation.

Mellor and Thorpe's pistols Mellor had left at his cousin's at Dungeon Wood, where the apprentices hid them under some flocks, and after that in the laite. At this house Mellor also left his own bottle-green top-coat and Thorpe's, and took his cousin's drab coat away as a disguise.

The Luddites were now triumphant, and quiet and honest people were frantic with fear. We draw upon our local authority for a picture of the aspect of things at this crisis. There were, however, brave men still resolute and determined. "At Marsden, on the receipt of the intelligence, the authorities, undismayed, prepared for all emergencies, and redoubled their precautions. The headquarters of cavalry were at the house now belonging to Mr. Robert Taylor. It was then the principal inn in the village, and known as the Old Red Lion, kept by a landlord named John Race. The large room still extending over the entire building—now applied to a far different purpose—was converted into barracKs for the cavalry, their horses being kept in the adjoining stables. At Ottiwells, where a portion of the infantry was continually on guard during the night, prompt measures against a probable attack were taken. Watch and ward was maintained by the soldiery and the local constabulary, a strict surveillance was kept over all suspected individuals, and no lights were permitted in any dwellings after nine o'clock in the evening. It was naturally anticipated that Woodbottom Mill and its proprietors would be the next objects of vengeance, and preparations were made to frustrate it. For months past, Enoch and James Taylor had slept in the mill in consequence of their lives being threatened and their own dwellings being unsafe, and they formed part of the mill garrison at night. Their future partner, Arthur Hirst, was the woollen engineer at the mill, and he vigorously laboured to convert the factory into a fortified place, becoming for the time a military engineer. The windows of the first storey were barricaded. The doors and window-shutters were coated inside with sheet iron. All communication between the first and upper storeys could be cut off, and the defenders inside were enabled to fire upon an attacking force from the upper storeys while sheltered themselves. A trap-door on a floor over the water-wheel had been so ingeniously planned by Arthur Hirst, that if the rioters had gained an entrance they would, on touching the flooring, drop through it into the wheel-race below.

Such was the fear of the vengeance of the Luddites, that Mellor and his companions remained undiscovered for nearly a year. Though two thousand pounds (a large sum for poor workmen) was offered for their apprehension, they remained going in and out at Longroyd Mill just as usual, though several dozen men must have known of their guilt. At last, Benjamin Walker, tempted by the reward, betrayed them, and was admitted evidence for the Crown. A special commission was held at York, before Baron Thomas and Judge Le Blanc, for the trial of the Luddites, sixty-four in number, who were concerned in the disturbances in the West Riding. The assizes commenced on Saturday, January 2nd, 1813, and terminated on the 12th of the same month. Amongst the prisoners were three of the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, namely, George Mellor, William Thorpe, and Thomas Smith. The evidence against them was conclusive. The prisoners were defended by Henry, now Lord Brougham. At that day it was a peculiarity of the law in trials for such crimes as the prisoners were charged with, that while their counsel could cross-examine the witnesses for the crown, and examine the witnesses for the defence, they could not address the jury on behalf of the accused. This palpable and cruel injustice no longer exists. Mr. Justice Le Blanc, the presiding judge, summed up the evidence clearly and impartially. At the close of the summing-up the jury retired, and returned in twenty-five minutes, bringing in a verdict of 'Guilty' against all the prisoners, who, upon being asked if they had anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon them, severally declared that they were 'Not Guilty,' Thorpe adding, 'Evidence has been given false against me, that I declare.' Before and after the conviction an impression possessed many minds that Smith was not as culpable as the rest, and that he was as much sinned against as sinning. This feeling was strengthened by the fact that the jury singled him out from the rest, and, the day before the execution, recommended him to mercy; but the recommendation was disregarded. The trial concluded on Wednesday, the 6th of January. In those days death followed quickly upon conviction, and on the Friday following the execution of the three men took place at York. In the short interval between conviction and execution the prisoners were very penitent, yet persistently refused to make any acknowledgment of their guilt. Mellor declared 'that he would rather be in the situation he was then placed in, dreadful as it was, than have to answer for the crime of their accuser (Walker);' adding, that 'he would not change places with him for his liberty and two thousand pounds.' To prevent the possibility of rescue, the place of execution was guarded by a strong force of cavalry and infantry, and at nine o'clock in the morning, in the presence of a vast assemblage of people, the murderers met their doom. Though deeply affected, they made no confession of their guilt. On the Saturday but one following, fourteen more persons were executed at York for crimes of a similar character; a wholesale execution which has since had no parallel in England."

Walker, the informer, was ever after shunned and detested. His ill-earned money did not prosper; he became poor, and in his old age had to apply for parish relief at Huddersfield.

"The members of the firm of Messrs. Abraham and John Horsfall took the death of their son and nephew greatly to heart; and the father, Mr. Abraham Horsfall, from thenceforth appeared to imbibe a dislike to Marsden. The use of the obnoxious machinery was discontinued at Ottiwell's and cropping by hand resumed; and in a few years afterwards their mill property in Marsden was disposed of, Bankbottom Mills passing into the possession of Messrs. Norris, Sykes. and Priestley; and Ottiwells to Messrs. Abraham and William Kinder. It is related that, after his son's death, Mr. Abraham Horsfall never again entered the mill at Ottiwells, and when riding past on his way to Bankbottom, he invariably averted his face from the mill, as if its very sight was hateful and painful to him."

On the 9th of January, Haigh, Dean, Ogden, the three Brooks, Walker, and Hirst were tried for the attack on Cartwright's mill. Haigh, Dean, Ogden, Thomas Brook, and Walker were found guilty and hanged. The rest were acquitted.

After this wholesome severity, the Luddites never made much lead in Yorkshire. The spirit of resistance was roused, leaders were wanting to the rioters, and the better class of workmen began to shrink from combinations that, beginning in destroying machinery, soon ripened into murder.— *All The Year Round.*

Huddersfield and Holmfirth Examiner - Saturday 23 August 1890

In a communication respecting the Luddites to Notes and Queries (7th s. x. 90) by the Rev. John Pickford, and which was reprinted in the *Leeds Mercury Supplement*, the other day, it is stated that "an interesting account of the rioters, and of the murder of Mr. Abraham Horsfall, who was shot by the Luddites, April 28th, 1812 ... may be found in "Old Stories Retold", by Walter Thornbury, p.p. 157, 73. This statement is not correct. It was Mr. William Horsfall who was shot, and not Abraham. The victim had a brother, the Rev. Abraham Horsfall, who was for some years the incumbent of Marsden. What I wish here to point out is that the "interesting account" mentioned as being given in "Old Stories Retold", by Walter Thornbury, was taken almost word for word from a series of capital articles, entitled "Of the Luddites, and the Murder of Mr. William Horsfall," being given in the *Huddersfield Examiner* about thirty years ago, and were written by Mr. (now County Alderman) J. B. Robinson, of Marsden.

The manner in which these articles got to Mr. Thornbury was rather strange, and I may at another time tell how he came by them. His sole acknowledgment was to place quotation marks before and after one of his many excerpts, with the slight intimation, "A local correspondent says." I understand that a good many of Mr. Robinson's able paragraphs have been utilised elsewhere, but in few instances has there been full and honourable recognition of the source whence they were derived.

ON THE BAT'S BACK

...

In the month of August last, I referred in this column to a communication respecting the "Luddites," which was copied in from "Notes and Queries" into the *Leeds Mercury*. The excerpt was entitled "an interesting account of the rioters, and of the murder of Mr. Abraham Horsfall, of Marsden," taken from "Old stories re-told" by Walther Thornbury. I then pointed out that the "interesting account, &c." had been "lifted" without anything like due acknowledgement from the pages of the *Examiner*, and that the author of the "interesting account" was not Mr Thornbury, but Mr. (now County Alderman) J. B. Robinson, of Marsden. The readers of the *Examiner* for the past thirty years will need no reminding of the many interesting and valuable contributions which have appeared in the columns of this paper from the pen of Mr. J. B. Robinson. During the period a great number of Mr Robinson's articles have been utilised elsewhere, but in few instances has there been any acknowledgement of the source from whence they had been derived.

It is well known that for a great number of years Mr. Robinson has been a close student of local history, more especially in connection with Marsden and neighbourhood, and has collated a great number of interesting facts and information on the subject of "The Luddites," "Marsden Church and its Graveyard," "Marsden Black Flood," "The Poaching Days and Ways," "Famous Marsden Oratorios," and other interesting subjects. Much of this information was embodied in the articles to which I have referred. At the repeated request of a great number of friends Mr. Robinson, I am happy to say, has decided to collect a number of these articles and publsh them in book form, with notes and additions. Personally, I am very glad that Mr. Robinson has come to this decision, and it gives me much pleasure to have the honour of being the first to make it known on "The Bat's Back."

Brandreth and his treason, terribly expiated on the scaffold at Derby, belongs more to the history of political agitation. The Nottingham riots were not attended with circumstances so interesting as those we have given, and the burning of Messrs. Wire and Duncroft's manufactory at West Houghton, in Lancashire, on the 24th of April, 1812, we have no room to describe here.

The record of the Luddite riots is a black and warning page in the social history of England. It is a melancholy picture of ignorance, of useless crime, and of cruel vengeance, yet it was by such painful and blood-stained steps that the English workman learned the madness and folly of combinations against progress. Cobbett, with his fine vigorous Saxon sense, refuted the arguments of the Yorkshire rioters in his admirable and most useful "Letter to the Luddites." He says:

"To show that machines are not naturally and necessarily an evil, we have only to suppose the existence of a patriarchal race of a hundred men and their families, all living in common, four men of which are employed in making cloth by hand. Now, suppose some one to discover a machine by which all the cloth wanted can be made by one man. The consequence would be that the great family would (having enough of everything else) use more cloth; or, if any part of the labour of the three cloth-makers were much wanted in any other department, they would be employed in that other department. Thus would the whole be benefited by this invention. The whole would have more clothes amongst them, or more food would be raised, or the same quantity as before would be raised, leaving the community more leisure for study or recreation. See ten miserable mariners cast on shore on a desert island, with only a bag of wheat and a little flax-seed. The soil is prolific; they have fish and fruits; the branches or bark of trees would make them houses, and the wild animals afford them meat. Yet, what miserable dogs they are! They can neither sow the wheat, make the flour, nor catch the fish or the animals. But let another wreck toss on the shore a spade, gun, and some fish-hooks and knives, and how soon the scene is changed! Yet they want clothes; and in order to make them shirts, for instance, six or seven out of the ten are constantly employed in making the linen. This throws a monstrous burden of labour on the other three, who have to provide the food. But send them a loom, and you release six out of the seven from the shirt-making concern, and ease as well as plenty immediately succeeds. In these simple cases the question is decided at once in favour of machines."

These arguments are irrefutable, and may be thus summarised: Improved machinery lowers the price of production. The cheaper a fabric is, the greater is the demand for it, and it at once undersells the fabric produced without machinery. Where the demand for a certain fabric increases, more hands are of course employed. Younger persons can work at machinery than at handicrafts where strength is required. Suppose machinery abolished in Lancashire: that would not prevent its being employed elsewhere. The wife and children would be thrown out of work by the stopping of the lighter machinery. The husband and father, having to support his family alone, requires higher wages. Prices are raised to meet this drain for more wages. Trade again flows to the cheaper market. The trade in the non-progressive or riotous places dwindles. Fewer workmen are required; down go wages; and Poverty, Famine, and Death, those cruel teachers of political economy, creep into the half-deserted factories, and push the workmen from their seats into the graves that have long been gaping at their feet.

In February, 1812, Mr. Ryder brought in a bill rendering frame-breaking a capital offence. The act passed.

THE LUDDITES IN THE WEST RIDING.

*By A. A. Watson, in "Country Words"*

Two generations have passed away from the face of the world since the attack was made upon Cartwright's Mill, Rawfolds, by the Luddites in 1812. Few men can remember with any degree accuracy the stirring times that were then made by discontented labouring men—goaded till poverty stared them hard in the face with its unwelcome visage. Commercial affairs were at nearly a dead lock, the price of provisions and clothing high, and the Peninsular war occupying care and attention—and perhaps demanding money that would have been better appropriated if spent In allaying the germs of discontent and the pangs of hunger at home, and, "Oh, were I King of France," would no doubt be a line suggestive to working, men of suitable words to meet their ideas at that time. Of course we cannot at the present day imagine such a state of commotion as then existed; great advances have been made since that time in the condition of the man who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow, and to us the followers of the imaginary Ned Lud command not much more sympathy than the Fenian of to-day. Grievances must not now be settled in such a Christian country as ours by recourse to the strength of arm. Duels have given place to actions at law; and if there are any sore spots in the condition of any class of men, they are all best remedied by an appeal to laws that grow less one-sided at every Parliamentary session. The Luddite riots were commenced at the latter end of the year 1811, at Nottingham, at the instigation (no doubt) of agitators, typified present by our Odgers and Bradlaughs, and made successful from the combined influences to which we have before referred; and the one event that lingers prominent in the popular memory is the attack made in April, 1812, on the premises of Mr. William Cartwright, at the little factory still standing on the road side at Rawfolds, between Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike. Yet, though so well known by tradition (if a story but sixty yearn old may be deemed traditionary) few who pass the adjoining turnpike will notice its inslgolflcant form and shape, lost as it is in the forgetfulness occasioned by the nearness of massive new stone factories that overshadow it in bulk. The Luddites seem to have had a strong series of committees under the control of general committees, and a strong and detestable oath, added to a silent yet stern discipline [that] seems to have kept the men who were members in clutches from which, if they possessed the wish, they lacked the courage break. We give copy of the oath for the perusal of our readers:— "I, ————— of my voluntary will, do declare and solemnly swear that I never will reveal to any person or persons who compose the secret committees, their proceedings, meetings, places of abode, dress, features, connections, or anything else that might lead to a discovery of the same, either by word or deed, or sign, under the penalty of being sent out of the world by the first brother who shall meet me, and my name and character blotted out of existence, and never be remembered but with contempt and abhorrence; and I farther now do swear that I will use my best endeavour to punish by death any traitor or traitors, should any rise up amongst us, wherever I can find him or them; and though they should fly to the verge of nature, I will pursue them with unerasing vengeance. So help me God, to bless and help me to keep my oath inviolate." By midnight attacks in bodies, with disguised faces, and armed with every conceivable weapon, did these fanatics pursue their calling. The destruction of obnoxious machinery seemed to be their original intent; but not content with this programme, they destroyed goods that had either been made or finished with the aid of machinery. To these aims they added the stealing of arms and money. Burglaries were committed by wholesale in the villages throughout the West Riding that were near to the great towns, and anything portable in the shape of gold and silver went to increase their spoils. The members were armed with the knives, pistols, or muskets stolen in these midnight rambles, and drilled in companies on the outskirts of their villages at the dead of night. In these depredations they were classed into sections, distinguished by the arm they bore; and it seems that in some of their attacks that even sections of unarmed men were amongst some of the bodies. In March, 1812, at Rawden, parties attacked factories and destroyed the machinery and goods. On the 8th April following, a body of three hundred did similar mischief at Wakefield, as before described, with the addition of front and rear guards of mounted men carrying drawn sabres. Soon after, the Sheffield Militia Armoury was broken into and gutted, and factories at last were demolished and set on fire in all the great centres of the woollen trade. Intimidation was prevalent; the military had to keep constantly ready for calls to arms, and the crowds of rioters had to be dispersed by them daily. Not content with all this commotion, the leaders then impressed upon their dupes that nothing would be decisive till the masters were shot. A Mr Horsfall, of Marsden, was the first they attempted to shoot, and the only person who met his death at their hands. A young woman at Leeds was nearly beaten to death because she had accidentally become acquainted with information that might be used against them. A constable and a magistrate's lives were attempted, as well as the life of General Campbell. All these things happened in the month of April, 1812; and, perhaps, were it not for the prompt measures taken by a Mr Joseph Radcliffe, of Milnsbridge (afterwards for his bravery made a baronet), who formed bodies of special constables, and in other ways gave auxiliary and valuable help to the authorities—as well as the determined resistance made by Mr Cartwright,—things would not have then been so readily settled. On the 11th of April, at one o'clock, one hundred men from the Huddersfield district marched over to Rawfolds at dead of night, armed with various weapons and firearms, and for nearly half an hour endeavoured to break in the doors of Mr Cartwright's factory, demolishing the windows, but at last foiled in their attempts, leaving two wounded men, a quantity of weapons, and other things about the place. The facts of the case seem to have been as follows:—Mr Cartwright had several machines used in the finishing processes of the woollen trade that were obnoxious to the Luddites, and he had for some time expected a nocturnal visit from the secret society. He therefore prepared himself for protecting his property by taking beds into his mill and offices, and accommodating his men there at nights. All were possessed of arms. On the night of the attack ten men were in the mill, half of them soldiers. The howl of the dog was their first alarm; and so well did they protect themselves and their property that they drove away the band of men ten times their number in the time above stated. For this bravery, Mr Cartwright received a gift of £3,000 from the neighbouring gentry. A week after the attack on the mill he was shot at on the road by an unseen man. It was only ten days after this that Mr Horsfall was killed, and then justice, with its slow yet certain claws, seized on their gang, broke up their secret tribunals; and in the January of the following year (1813), sixty-six of the leaders were convicted at a special commission held at York, presided over by Baron Thompson and Sir Simon le Blanc. Seventeen of them were capitally convicted, and paid the penalty with their lives; of the remained, some were sentenced to penal servitude, and the rest were discharged upon their own recognisance to appear for judgment when called upon.

OLD DERBY STORIES RE-TOLD. [No. III] THE LUDDITES' RISING IN 1817.

The year 1817 was memorable in the annals of Derby for the trial and execution of three men, Brandreth, Ludlam, and Turner, in front of the old gaol in Friar-gate; but before proceeding to tell the story of an event which a few of the old inhabitants of the town still remember with shuddering, we will briefly glance at the circumstances which led to "the last beheading in England." In 1811, the French war had so far diminished the trade of this country, and taxation was so mightily increased, that great distress prevailed in the manufacturing parts of the kingdom, especially in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, where the hosiery trade was principally carried on. Many workmen were discharged, partly owing to the decrease of demand for the article manufactured, and partly to the invention of a wide-frame for weaving stockings, by which a great saving of labour was effected. An idiot named Ned Lud having broken one of these frames in a passion, the working classes were not slow to take the hint, and parties of them banded together under the designation of Luddites, directed their attacks against the new machinery, and thereby occasioned alarming tumults. These were continued next year with augmented daring, attended with outrages of other kinds, until the name "Luddite" was sufficient to create a panic in this district. In April, 1812, riots took place at Macclesfield, Leads, Sheffield, Manchester, and other places in the north; but a bill was passed to punish the breakers of frames, and, for a time, the peace was preserved. In April, 1814, Nottingham was the scene of more violence of this description, and in 1816, the distress amongst the unoccupied artisans having increased, discontent occurred everywhere, and commotions in many places. With the advent of 1817, the continent after a long period of war and desolation settled into a state of repose; but in England, as might be expected, trade was at a standstill, and the people were ready to lay the fault of all this trouble at the door of Government. The great agitator of his day, Sir Francis Burdett, undertook to force a measure of Reform upon Parliament by means of monstre petitions, and the use of other means which are not entirely unknown in our own time; but his bill was rejected by 265 to 77. The radicals were furious, and threatened all of sorts of violence; the Government, however rightly conceiving that desperate diseases require firmly applied remedies, rewarded the ringleaders with imprisonment and the scaffold, instead of County Court Judgeships. The Luddites about this time seem to have taken more concentrated action, and, as usual when this is the case, a leader was not long in presenting himself.

It was during these very unsatisfactory days that the inhabitants of Derby were suddenly seized with a panic, the origin of which has never been satisfactorily traced, and a courteous correspondent has favoured us with the following transcript of some lines, which appeared in the *Nottingham Review* of January 11th, 1817. They are as follows:

THE SEIGE?? OF DERBY.

*Parturiunt montes, nascitur ridiculus mus.*

Some time ago, a peaceful town,  
Wherein sedition was unknown,  
Was thrown into a state of terror,  
Some say by *Hope*, and some by *Error*,  
Especial constables were sworn,  
And troups arrived from night till morn!  
Fresh guards were sent to the Depôt,  
And couriers posted to and fro:  
The club ycleped "True Blue" assembled;  
Wives were afraid, and mothers trembled;  
The yeomanry had secret orders,  
Some in the town, some on the borders;  
Regiments paraded every street,  
And townsmen scarcely dared to meet,  
Lest, from their casual conversation,  
About the posture of the nation,  
Some *sly Informer* might collect  
Treason, or words of dis-respect.  
Each one conjectured something new,  
And every tale was told as true.  
Among a thousand other lies,  
Some said the Luddites meant to rise—  
The Hosiers heard it with dismay,  
And S-ms had well-nigh run away—  
Others denied that this was true,  
And, without any more ado,  
Declared that secret information,  
Was given to the Corporation,  
Wherein were evidently shown  
Evil designs against the Throne.  
A third class, who were more believed  
Than all the rest, had been conceived  
That these precautions were all meant  
To move the poor to discontent,  
And give the Loyalists a chance  
(As some had lately done in France)  
To show, by furious persecution,  
Their hatred for a Revolution,  
And with their Bacchanalian zeal,  
D——n Hampden and the Commonweal.  
Thus were opinions propogated——  
Some borrowed, others self-created.  
Three days elapsed without a riot,  
And all was peacable and quiet;  
The yeomanry were now dismissed,  
And, strange to tell, they were not hissed,  
(Tho' surely, such a wretched crew  
Were never brought into review)  
The special constables retired,  
And not a single shot was fired;  
No one could tell what was intended,  
And thus the Siege of Derby ended!

These lines (written, evidently, by some Nottingham radical, desirous of combining a little veiled disloyalty with a sneer at the rival town of Derby) show to what a pitch of fever the country was wrought by the outbreaks of these discontented operatives; and subsequent events also countenanced all the precautions which elicited the sarcasms of the Nottingham bard. For on the morning of the 8th June, 1817, a forbidding man, who was addressed as "the Nottingham Captain," made his appearance at the White Horse public-house, Pentrich, kept by Widow Weightman, and, seating himself at a table, spread out a map of England marked with crosses at various points where, as he said, simultaneous risings were to take place on a certain day for the purpose of effecting a revolution, or, to use his own a words, of "wiping all off." In glowing words he explained to his hearers that bodies of Luddites from all parts were to proceed to Nottingham and take the town, especially mentioning Sheffield, Leeds, Manchester (towns where the Luddites had previously been particularly busy), as sending contingents. Rising up, he declaimed

Every man his skill must try,  
He must turn out and net deny.  
No bloody soldiers must we dread,  
We must *turn out and fight for bread.*  
The time is come, you plain must see,  
*The Governmenet opposed must be.*

And he added that "every village and every part there must kill its own vermin." Thus, they were to go to Wingfield Manor, set a bundle of straw on fire before Colonel Hatton's door, who, when he came out, was to be shot. Mr. Jessop, of Butterley, was also to be murdered, as well as Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Ragg, of the Butterley Works, which were then to be taken posession of. The words we have printed in italics in Brandreth's doggrel verses show first, the plea for the rising, and, second, the design; the last line was particularly quoted against him on his trial.

George Weightman, the widow's son, was appointed aide-de-camp to the captain, and a number of persons, carried away by the apparent earnestness of the man, contributed, then and there, sundry sums of money for the purpose of procuring gunpowder. As for bullets, the roofs of churches on the line of march would, it was hinted, furnish lead enough for the purpose of casting. Next night, about a score of these deluded creatures (whom it seems absurd to dignify by the title of insurgents) met in a barn and paraded their arms. The Nottingham Captain, his aide-de-camp Weightman, and a man named William Turner, had guns, two or three others carried swords, and the majority were armed with "pikes," light poles about nine feet long, headed with iron roughly beaten into blades. Such was the nucleus of the "rebellion" which was soon to spread dire consternation through the country, and whose history we shall continue in our next.

(To be continued).
```

The following week, a correspondent took issue with the claim that the Pentridge rebels were the last men to be beheaded in England.

THE LAST BEHEADING IN ENGLAND.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE DERBY MERCURY.

Sir—The writer of "Old Derby Stories Retold" is clearly in error when he states that Brandreth, Ludlam, and Turner, were the last instances of beheading in England. The Luddite rising occurred in 1817, and three years after this Thistlewood, Brunt, Ings, Davidson and Tidd, were hanged and then beheaded, at Newgate, for the celebrated "Cato-street Conspiracy."  
Yours, D.
```

*It is also worth noting that the Cato Street conspirators were also sentenced to quartering, but that part of the sentence was also commuted.*

Memorials of old Derbyshire
by Cox, J. Charles (John Charles), 1843-1919

Publication date 1907

p35-7

To this county belongs the discredit of being the last place in the provinces where that horrible medley of butchery and torture — "hung, drawn, and quartered" — which our forefathers invented as a penalty for high treason, was carried out, although happily in a somewhat modified form. The actually last instance occurred in 1820, when the five Cato Street conspirators were beheaded after being hung. This shocking form of death fell to the lot of a Derbyshire framework knitter and two stonemasons in 1817. This was the time when the distress amongst the working classes in the Midlands had come to a climax, when every project of constitutional reform was stifled, and when a few half-starved men, deliberately incited by the spies and informers of those in authority, planned an abjectly foolish but riotous and murderous scheme to obtain relief, which was hatched at the "White Horse" Inn, Pentrich. The two or three score of labourers who took part in this rising were almost instantly scattered by the yeomanry; but the policy of the Government seems to have been to use this instrument to terrify the populace at large, and thereby to crush all attempts at reform. Hence everything was done that could be to exaggerate the so-called rebellion, and although the misguided ringleaders richly deserved punishment at the hands of the ordinary authority, it seems monstrous to have charged the offenders with high treason, and with the crime of levying war against the King. However, a special commission of four judges was appointed, and the trials at Derby, which extended over ten days, began on 15th of October. Most of the forty-six prisoners were condemned to transportation, but three of the ringleaders, James Brandreth, William Turner, and Isaac Ludlam, received the capital sentence for high treason. The prince regent signed the warrant for the execution of these three "traitors," drawn from the humblest station in life, remitting that part of the sentence which related to "quartering," with other absolutely unspeakable details, but ordering the hanging, drawing, and beheading. Two axes were ordered of Bamford, a smith of Derby, the pattern being taken from one in the Tower, which was supposed to have served in like cases.

On the morning of Friday, the seventh of November, the three miserable men, heavily ironed, were jolted round the prison yard on a horse-drawn hurdle or sledge, prepared, like the block, by Finney, the town joiner. On mounting the scaffold in front of the county jail, Brandreth and his fellows briefly testified that they had been brought to this plight by the tempting of Oliver, the degraded Government spy. They hung from the gallows for half an hour. Brandreth's body was the first taken down and placed on the block. The greatest difficulty had been experienced in finding an executioner, but at last the high fee of twenty-five guineas secured several applicants. The chosen headsman was a Derbyshire collier; he was masked, and his identity was never disclosed. The mutilation was bungled; but when accomplished, the executioner seized the head by the hair, and holding it at arm's length in three different directions over the crowd, thrice proclaimed, "Behold the head of the traitor Jeremiah Brandreth." The other two were served in like manner. The scaffold was surrounded by a strong force of cavalry with drawn swords, and several companies of infantry were also present The dense crowd was quite over-awed, and could utter no other protest than "terrifying shrieks."

In that crowd was the poet Shelley. The day before the execution, the Princess Charlotte died in childbirth, and Shelley seized the opportunity to write a vigorous and now most rare pamphlet drawing a contrast between che two deaths.

The block on which these three men were beheaded is still preserved in the new county gaol at Derby. It consists of two 2 1/2 in. planks fastened together, and measures 6 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. Six inches from one end a piece of wood 3 in. high is nailed across. The whole is tarred over, but the wood, strangely enough, remains damp in places. A tradition used to be current that the block sweated every seventh of November, on the anniversary of the execution; the writer visited it on that day in 1888, and found no difference in the sweating to what he had noticed in the previous week.

OLD DERBY STORIES RE-TOLD. [No. III] THE LUDDITES' RISING IN 1817. (Continued.)

[By a misprint in our last, Colonel Halton's name was rendered "Hatton," a printer's error which has not escaped the attention of numerous correspondent, whom we take this opportunity of thanking for the lively interest they manifest in this branch of our editorial duties.]

We now find the Luddites upon the march; Brandreth, the "Nottingham Captain," headed one division of his ragged army, and William Turner the other, and on their route they went to work according to the approved German tactics, "requisitioning" fire-arms at every farm-house, and in some instances compelling the young men of the house (farmers sons and servants) to join them. Their demand was "a gun and a man," and one of these pressed men, a son of Mr. Elijah Hall, afterwards gave evidence which probably had great weight in determining the conviction of the chief conspirator, whose hands, as we shall soon see, were stained with the blood of an innocent man. At Mr. Walker's, a pistol with a brass barrel was obtained by Brandreth, and stuck in a twisted-up leather apron worn by him as a belt. From Walker's, they went to Samuel Hunt's, and then to Mrs. Hepworth's, where Brandreth, having had his demands refused, went round to a back window and fired a shot at her servant, Robert Walters, who was hit in the shoulder and died almost immediately. The consternation which this barbarous act occasioned may easily be imagined; Brandreth now told everyone who resisted that he had already shot one man, adding, "and if you resist I'll shoot you," a remark which the Attorney-General afterwards used against him on the trial in proving that the murder proceeded from the determination of the conspirators to sacrifice the lives of their fellow-creatures for the accomplishment of the treasonable object they had in view. The Captain's appearance at this time is described as that of a swarthy man with bushy black whiskers, dressed in a dark brown top-coat and grey pantaloons, and the aforesaid apron as a belt twisted around him.

The first serious repulse the insurgents met with was at the Butterley Iron Works, where preparations had been made to receive them, and where one of the managers, Mr. George Goodwin, remonstrated with them in a very spirited manner, and actually gave shelter to several of the pressed men, besides stopping George Weightman, who was carrying about eighty pounds weight of bullets on horseback to Nottingham. At the "Glass House" tavern in Codnor, a halt was called, and the landlord was "requisitioned" for refreshments; and here the party was considerably reinforced. On the road to Nottingham they were met, at Langley Mill, by George Weightman, who after consultation with Brandreth proclaimed that "all was going on well; the soldiers were in barracks and would not stir; Nottingham was taken, and they must get there as soon as possible." This news, however, was discredited, and the hearts of many of the men began to fail them as they noticed the whispers of their leaders; so much so that the ranks began to thin, and when they got to Eastwood a report that the yeomanry were upon them caused a panic. They then immediately dispersed, flinging away their guns and pikes, which were afterwards picked up in considerable numbers. An attempt to rally them proved quite unsuccessful, and away they ran. Down came the 15th Hussars, under Capt. Phillips, to the number of 18 men and a sergeant, and captured about 30 of the rioters; the High Sheriff (Mr. Hallowes, of Glapwell Hall), with a party of yeomanry found Turner secreted in a ditch, and took him and several others prisoners; and, thus, although the leaders escaped for the time, the "insurrection" was at an end.

We learn that great alarm was caused in Derby by the reports which were continually arriving as to the strength and determination of the rioters. Glover says:—"The Rev. Charles Stead Hope was mayor of the borough, and he acted with his usual promptitude and firmness; assisted particularly by the aldermen, Richard Leaper, and the late Thomas Lowe, Esqrs. Under their orders a company of the 95th Regiment, under the command of Capt. Hellerman, was on duty throughout the night of the 9th of June, and in the course of that night, two troops of the Derbyshire yeomanry cavalry, under the command of Major Sir R. Wilmot, of Chaddesden, Bart., arrived in the town. In consequence of the information received during the night, the Calke and Ashborne troops were sent for; and these bodies of yeomanry proceeded under the command of the gallant major towards Langley Bridge. On the way they were joined by the Chesterfield troop, commanded by Capt. Wright, who had on the preceding day advanced to Alfreton."

Considering that the printed report of the Special Commission held at Derby from the 16th to the 25th of October, 1817, occupies two thick octavo volumes, our readers will observe that we have given but an outline of the rising which was afterwards exalted by the Government into a treasonable "levying of war against the King in his realm." We shall see presently that public opinion was strongly opposed to the extreme measures which were taken against these men; for it was generally believed that the whole affair had its origin it the mischievous brain of one Oliver, a hired Government spy, who was directly interested in fomenting such an outbreak. It is asserted that this man introduced himself to a number of disaffected people as a delegate from the Central Union for effecting a Reform in Parliament, and stated that nothing but physical force could effect a revolution; adding that he was in a position to raise incalculable numbers of men to join them. Oliver's name is even now held in execration in many parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.

The chief conspirators being taken and lodged in prison, a Special Commission was appointed to sit at Derby to try them on no less a charge than that of High Treason, the blackest crime known to the law. The High Sheriff (Mr. Hallowes) received the Judges (Mr. Justice Abbott and Mr. Justice Holroyd) on the 25th September, 1817, in a style suited to an occasion of so much importance. Two hundred special constables, the full retinue of javelin men, and an unusually large attendance of the gentry and yeomanry accompanied the Sheriff to meet the Judges on the London-road, and after the Commission was opened a grand dinner was served up at the George Inn. On the following morning twelve prisoners were brought from Nottingham by coach, under an escort of the 15th Hussars, and the whole thirty-five were then produced before the Judges and informed that their trial was fixed for the 15th October. Mr. Robert Bond, of Leicester, and Mr. Thomas Wragg, of Belper, declared themselves solicitors for the defence, and stated that the prisoners wished for John Cross, Esq., and Thomas Denman, Esq. (afterwards Lord Chief Justice of England) to be their counsel. The Court was then adjourned, and their lordships left Derby about noon.

On Tuesday evening, the 14th October, Derby was thronged with strangers, and no wonder, for three hundred jurymen were summoned, and the witnesses for the prosecution numbered some two hundred and sixty-eight; to these must be added the immense concourse which proceedings so unusual drew together from all the adjacent parts. The Lord Chief Baron (Sir Richard Richards) entered Derby privately, as also did the counsel for the prosecution, ten in number, headed by the Attorney General (Sir Samuel Shepherd) and whipped-in by Mr. John Balgay. Next day the business of the Special Commission commenced in good earnest; the prisoners were brought from Nottingham, as before, with a military escort, and accompanied by a post-chaise full of pikes, guns, &c., ready to be produced in evidence against them. Almost the first words of the presiding Judge were directed to the reporters, who were emphatically ordered to refrain from publishing any part of the proceedings until the whole should be concluded; this charge excited much wondering comment. The first twelve prisoners named in the indictment were Thomas Bacon, an aged man; Jeremiah Brandreth, described as "a low stiff man with a large black beard, not having bean shaved since he went to prison;" George Weightman, aged 25; William Turner, aged 46; Joseph Turner, 19; Isaac Ludlanm, sen., 52; Isaac Ludlam, jun.; Samuel Ludlam, 32; William Ludlam, 23; Samuel Hunt, 22; Edward Turner, 31; and Robert Turner, 17. On Thursday, Brandreth was placed at the bar, and at this distance of time it may be interesting to our readers to be put in possession of the names of the jury who, after many "challenges," were selected to try him. They were

William Wilkes of Church Broughton;  
John Stretton of Church Broughton;  
John Tempest of Burley;  
Samuel Wilder of Etwall;  
Thomas Archer of Hatton;  
Robert Eaton of Osliston;  
Thomas Gilman of Osliston;  
Thomas Sherwin of Rodaley;  
Thomas Gilman of Rodsley;  
Harry Yates of Sapperton;  
John Oalkden of Yeaveley;  
John Adsetts of Shottle; all farmers.

Several gentlemen and farmers, not answering to their names when called on the jury, were fined 10l. each, amongst whom was Mr. Adsetts, who, however, came into Court in time to save himself. It is not our intention to sumnmarise the trials; suffice it to say that Brandreth, William Turner, Isaac Ludlam the elder, and George Weightman were tried and found guilty; after which Thomas Bacon, John Bacon, Samuel Hunt, Joseph Turner, Edward Turner, John Onion, John McKeswick, German Buxton, Josiah Godber, Edward Moore, John Moore, Charles Swaine, John Hill, Joseph Rawson, Geo. Brassington, Wm. Hardwick, Wm. Weightman, Alex Johnson, and Thos. Bettison pleaded Guilty. Against the others no evidence was offered, and the jury, under direction, found them Not Guilty. On being asked the usual question by the Clerk of the Arraign, "What have you to say for yourself why the Court should not pass sentence of Death upon you, according to law?" Brandreth replied, "I would ask for mercy, if mercy can be extended towards me; and I would address you in the words of our Saviour—if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not my will, but your will." Ludlam begged for mercy for the sake of his wife and family, and several of those who had pleaded guilty implored the Judge to shew mercy. Lord Chief Baron Richards, in passing the horrible sentence which the law enacts against traitors hoped that the sad example of the prisoners would "deter others from yielding to the wild and frantic delusions of a rebellious spirit and frighten others from being instruments in the hands of hellish agitators, who, to gratify their own malignity, promote and excite them, and plunge them into ruin in this world, and, it is feared in the next also." It is a curious fact that the Coroner's Inquisition charging several of the prisoners with being principals in the second degree in the murder of Robert Walters was rendered void by having no proper venue to the allegation of the offence. In the margin there was "Liberty of the Hundred of Scarsdale, in the County of Derby," then it went on "An Inquisition taken (and so forth) within the hundred and county aforesaid, &c., on the oaths of twelve persons who do upon their oaths say that some person or persons unknown, with force and arms, *at the parish aforesaid*, in the county aforesaid, &c.," no parish having been named. The objection was held to be decisive.

The sentence created a profound impression of dread in the Court, and Ludlam alone broke the dead silence with frantic cries for mercy, which were even heard in the distances whilst the prisoners were being removed to the gaol. We may here observe that the capital sentence was remitted in the case of George Weightman and of the others who pleaded guilty; the culprits being condemned to terms of transportation and imprisonment. Mr. Denman's eloquence, is described as having been most impressive, and it is due to the memory of that great man to record the fact that, on learning the poverty and wretchedness of the men for whom he had been pleading, he voluntarily returned his fees to their solicitors.

OLD DERBY STORIES RE-TOLD. [No. III.] THE LUDDITES' RISING IN 1817. (Continued.)

We are now approaching the "last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history;" for nothing now remains but to tell how Brandreth and his companions met their fate, and what were the impressions of eye-witnesses now living, who saw the dreadful sentence carried into effect.

The leader of this outbreak, Jeremiah Brandreth, seemed to have been steeped to the lips in poverty; some said he was an Irishman, others that he was a native of Exeter, and had been a sailor (it is probable that his parents had been in a good position); but all that is *certainly* known of him is that he was a framework-knitter, who before the rising occurred, had been removed from Sutton Ashfield to Wilford, in Nottinghamshire, where he was in receipt of parish relief. His courage and determination were conspicuous, and he was just the stamp of man likely to be selected as a tool by the unscrupulous agents who secretly fomented the disturbances, taking good care to keep in the background themselves. When the Jury brought in their verdict, *Guilty*, Brandreth seemed stunned, and before he had time to realise his position he was securely handcuffed to the gaoler, Mr. Eaton, who sat beside him in the dock. Here he remained until after the hall had been cleared, whilst the prison van was being brought up; and during the interval some one near him brought out a short pipe and some tobacco, which he received "with an awkward bow of gratitude," and immediately began to smoke in Court. And here we ought to state that this memorable trial took place in the great entrance-hall; the bench being placed before the door leading to the Judges' lodgings, and the jury-box on the right hand, facing the windows. The portion of the Court devoted to the public was fitted up with seats rising one above another. Some of the female servants of the Tavern, hard by, pitying the poor hunted wretch (as women always did and always will do), notwithstanding his ferocious aspect and uncouth demeanour, brought him a tumbler of negus and some sandwiches; whilst an enterprising gentleman tried hard, but ineffectually, to "interview" him on behalf of "the London newspapers." Brandreth was sternly uncommunicative to this individual, but gratefully accepted the food and drink which the kind-hearted wenches brought to him. Then the javelin-men surrounded him, and the crowd closed around him, silently now, for everybody knew that the man was doomed, and that to cheer him would be but a mockery; and so, on to the new gaol, a upon Nun's-green, which had sprung up close to the Headless Cross, and nearly opposite to the White Horse Tavern, concerning which we have heretofore discoursed. His former comrades flocked about him as he entered—he had but one word to utter, "Guilty!" and a shudder ran through the throng of untried ones. Then he sat down and wrote a letter to his wife in Sutton Ashfield—full of pathos and strong religious sentiment, but showing that he was quite aware that his days were numbered.

It was not until the 25th of October, as we have said, that a sentence was passed upon Brandreth, William Turner, Isaac Ludlam, and George Weightman, who on their return to prison were all placed in one cell. On the 29th, Ann Brandreth, having walked from Sutton Ashfield to see her husband, asked him for the map which he had at Pentridge, and also whether he had committed some crime which had been imputed to him, but he merely replied "it was unnecessary to enter into any controversy at that period." Mrs. Eaton tended the poor forlorn creature (already widowed), and gave her money for her return to the two orphan children. The warrant arrived on Sunday, November 2nd, bearing the sign-manual of the Prince Regent and of Lord Sidmouth; it rehearsed the sentence, and "remitted" that part of it only which related to the "quartering" of the bodies; Weightman was respited until the 14th, and consequently removed from his companions to a different cell. Then Brandreth was separated from the other two, and his fate announced to at him by the chaplain, the Rev. Pickering; but the Sheriff and Mr.Locket, for reasons best known to themselves, did not think proper to make any communication to Ludlam and Turner, who were left in direful doubt until the following morning.

The Chaplain tried very hard to break the shell of Brandreth's secret, but he would neither part with that, or with his beard; he smoked his pipe and rather bothered good Mr. Pickering with his arguments, telling him that "he had made his peace with his Maker and did not see that it was necessary for him to make any statement for the satisfaction of men." Only he was heard to mutter to himself, "Oliver has brought me to this;" "But for Oliver I should not have by been here"-referring, of course, to the mysterious friend of Host Robertshaw, of the "Talbot," in Iron-gate. Ludlam was certainly a Methodist, and, from his manner of expressing himself in prayer, had probably been a preacher; this was earnestly denied at the time by the *Derby Mercury* in an "inspired" paragraph, but there is strong evidence that the report circulated by the London papers to that effect was not devoid of foundation.

It was at ten o'clock on the morning of Nov. 7th that a strong detachment of the Enniskillen Dragoons took possession of the upper end of Friar-gate; special constables constables congregated around the "drop," which had been erected by Charles Finney (who is said to have replied to a question respecting the capability of the structure, that "it would serve for five *at a pinch*, but would hang three *comfortably*"), and the javelin-men on horseback drew up to their appointed station near to the specials. The people seemed thoroughly cowed by the spectacle, and shrank away from the horse which was taken into the gaol to drag the hurdle; this was a kind of sledge on which the condemned men were dragged around the prison-yard in view of the rest of the inmates—an unnecessary and absurd aggravation of the punishment of death. About a quarter to twelve Mr. Simpson, the Under Sheriff, made the last dread demand, and the "bodies" of the culprits were forthwith presented to him for execution. Bamford, the smith, who had made two axes for the occasion, also attended to knock-off the irons and fit on others which had locks upon them; Brandreth calmly smoking his pipe the while, relinquishing it only at the foot of the scaffold. A low groan broke from the crowd as the doomed men appeared on the scaffold, and Brandreth cried out, "God be with you all but Lord Castlereagh," to which Turner replied, "This is all Oliver and the Government," upon which Mr. Pickering officiously interposed and prevented any further observations. Ludlam delivered a fluent prayer, and at twenty-five minutes before one the first portion of the tragic drama wras played out.

We must crave the indulgence of our readers for the detail of barbarity which this narrative demands, and ask them to imagine Friar-gate packed with a crowd "as thick," says one of our correspondents (Mr. Edmund Hollingshead, who witnessed the spectacle) "as pebbles paving the street," waiting with pallid up-turned faces whilst saw-dust was scattered upon the platform, and the dead men were drawn a up by strings attached to their legs. We will quote the rest from an account published in the *Derby Mercury* at the time. "The irons were then unlocked and taken off the legs of the corpses ...the two axes were brought upon the scaffold, the bright shining heads of which formed a striking contrast to the black shafts fixed in them. They were as near as possible of the shape worn by pioneers, measuring at the foot eight and a half inches, and about a foot long. Two large knives were also introduced with black handles, and a basket to receive the heads. The block made by Mr. Finney, 'the town joiner,' was a large piece of timber, supported at each end by pieces of a foot high, and having a small cog of wood fixed across the upper end of it, on which the neck of the victim was to be placed for the purpose of decollation. This block was placed at one end of the scaffold, and three coffins, on which were chalked the names of the culprits were piled up at the other end. The crowd at this time was computed to amount to considerably more than six thousand. The body of Brandreth was then cut down, the cap was removed from the head, and, in laying the corpse on the block, the chin caught on the cog, which turned up the face and made it appear as though the eyes, which were wide e open, were fixed upon the people. . . . At twenty-five minutes after one the executioner struck the blow. The head was not at once detached from the body, and the blow appeared feebler to the populace than it really was, and a groan of disapprobation and horror was the consequence. The assistant, however, with one of the knives, instantly completed what had not been accomplished by the axe." [Mr. Hollingshead says "the executioner made two or more blows before the head fell, and then it hung by a piece of skin, which the executioner cut away with a knife."] "The blood flowed copiously, the head fell in the basket, and the hangman, seizing it by the hair, held it up and proceeded with it to the left, the right, and the front of the scaffold, proclaiming at each place, 'Behold the head of the traitor Jeremiah Brandreth!' The head was then carefully deposited in the coffin, which immediately afterwards received the body. The lid was then placed upon it, and the heads of Turner and Ludlam were taken off and exhibited in precisely the same manner." It has been noticed that the living witnesses of this memorable execution have very wavering and uncertain recollections of what followed the decapitation of Brandreth. We have said that the people were thoroughly "cowed"- they were, in fact, under the most dire apprehension of the soldiery, and when an irrepressible groan greeted the first fall of the axe a cry was raised "The soldiers are coming!" Mr. Hollingshead says "I shall not easily forget the dreadful yells and screams when the first head fell into the basket, and numbers were knocked down by the mob who were expecting the military to charge them." Several people, overcome by the concentrated horror of the spectacle, fainted, but were held up by the pressure of the crowd, and thus saved from being trampled to death. It is noteworthy that this was the first execution for high treason under the alteration in the sentence which permitted the crowning indignities of the executioner to be perpetrated upon the dead body of the traitor, instead of, as heretofore, cutting him down before life was extinct.

The bodies were buried in a corner of St. Werburgh's church-yard, near the brook, where a deep hole had been dug. Around this pit the javelin-men and constables were stationed, the coffins were lowered in without any ceremony, and the earth shovelled in. The sight was over, *justice* was satisfied, and each man departed to his own place, half-afraid to speak of what had passed, and distrusting the questions of his nearest friend. And that day, dark as it was, was rendered even more gloomy when the mail from London brought the news that the hope of the nation, the Princess Charlotte and her infant were dead.

Upon whose head was the blood of these men? It is hard to say. Men shook their heads when Castlereigh's name was mentioned, and openly execrated the names of Oliver and Castles, the spies; but the Press had no small share in the tragedy. Then, as now, seditious writings were freely circulated amongst the lower orders all over the kingdom, and were caught at by the simple and uneducated with dangerous avidity; the bait being a general partition of private property-universal pillage. This, however, is not the place for analysing motives—we have told the story; our readers may "point the moral" as they list.

Few towns can boast of a finer or more striking entrance than that by which a traveller by the Queen's highway comes from the North into the ancient borough of Derby. Friar-gate, however, in 1732, was not much like the spacious well-built street which is one of the chief glories of modern Derby. It had not then lost the characteristics which ara banded down to us by means of the queer plan of the town attached to Speed's map of "Darbieshire;" for changes were slow in coming here, until railways and Radicalism converted the little town, which Defoe described as "a place of gentry rather than trade" (adding that what trade existed was "chiefly in good ale"), into a busy, commercial and manufacturing centre of industry. Quaint half-timbered houses, of Elizabethan aspect, looked out upon the green churchyard of St. Werburgh's over the way, their upper stories projecting over the ill-paved causeway and affording shelter to the pedestrian in a sudden shower. Other lowly domiciles only boasted of one chamber above the ground-floor, and the latticed dormer windows peeped curiously out from amidst the thick thatch of the roof. There were but a few houses of red brick, most of which had lately been erected, and on the opposite side to the church the line of tatched roofs was only broken by the entrance gates and lodge of the Friary grounds. The relics of the old Dominican convent itself stood, far back from the street, in the midst of a pleasant park well-studded with stately trees; for Mr. Crompton, who had recently become the possessor of this deserted nest of the Black Friars, had not yet utilised the materials in building the mansion which is familiar to every native of Derby under the name of "The Friary" A road skirted the churchyard, and led by means of the Cuckstool bridge into St. Mary's-gate-an ominous path for women to travel, since the bridge crossed a mill-dam where the ducking-stool was erected; that terrible engine through whose means unruly wives were half-drowned into promises of obedience to their liege lords, by being soused, hissing-hot, into the clear waters of the Hoddo-brook. On the West side of the street, the houses stood upon the crest of a gentle slope of gravel (long since cut away and used for roadmaking), a relic of which is to be seen in the elevated footpath, and in the steps by which the front doors of those dwrellings are now gained. Brave beech trees lent a charming rural aspect to the scene, and, as the road widened out into the common known as Nun's Green, the houses became fewer and less important, and the roadside cross, so famous in Derby history, was seen to stand alone, by the side of the road, upon the waste. Old Hutton (let us remark, by way of digression) was not quite correct when he wrote that the inhabitants "erected" this cross in 1665 for the especial purpose of its serving as a medium betwixt buyer and seller during the perilous time of the Great Plague—it existed long before that period, and as the cattle and horse fairs had been held around it time out of mind, it was possibly the "market-cross" to which our ancestors naturally enough resorted in that time of need. The Borough Gaol, before which, in later days, Brandreth and his wretched misguided companions paid the debt of ignorance with their lives, and which served Hutton to direct the attention of his reader to what he contemptuously styles "a paltry public-house," had not been planned. The common, open to the brook, was intersected with streams and foot-paths, add the most important structures which met the eye were the pinfold and a wretched prison in Willow-row. After passing the "Headless Cross," the characteristics of the town began to lose themselves in those of the country; little cottages, built, perhaps, by adventurous "sqattrs on the waste," were dotted sparely here and there, and the road to Ashbourne lay for some distance between two rows of trees.

Amongst the last of those dwellings which the traveller for would pass as he left the town was the Old White Horse tavern, a hostelry which, almost unchanged in appearance, presents in 1875 a singular contrast with the brick houses which have sprung up around it. Here, the wayfarer could not fail to take a parting cup of the nut-brown ale (for which Derby was noted far and wide), always to be had in perfection at this homely roadside public-house; and the chances were that he would linger awhile to chat with the comely landlady, Mistress Ellen, or Eleanor, Beare, "a handsome woman," says Hutton, "of about thirty years of age, with an education superior to her rank, and mistress of that to persuasive eloquence which insensibly wins over the hearer to the speaker's own side." No one ever thought of conversing with Ebenezor Beare, whilst the active busy wife was in the house eclipsing him with her presence, and he seems to have been content with his position as a mere cipher under his own roof-tree, which even went familiarly amongst the gossips by the name of "Mrs. Beare's." Many a one, however, sought for the public-house, near Headless Cross who were neither tempted by the excellence of the ale nor the charms of the landlady. It is true that their errand was mostly a secret between themselves and Mrs. Beare, who, it was darkly whispered, dealt in other beverages quite as potent and not nearly so wholesome as strong ale, and could furnish husbands who were tired of their wives' clack with a less public and far more effectual method of stopping it for ever than even a ducking in the Cuckstool mill-dam. Nor was her assistance withheld from her own sex under similar difficulties, and if an indiscreet damsel wished to conceal her frailties from the prying eyes of her neighbours, or any married lady took a fancy to qualify herself for wearing a widow's cap, the landlady of the White Horse seldom disappointed those who reposed confidence in her skill.

Amongst the frequenters of the White Horse were a butcher, John Hewitt by name, and his wife, who dwelt in Stepping-lane, hard by (Ford-street), and who were each heartily tired of the other's company. He was rather a favourite of the landlady, and of her waiting-maid, Rosmamond Ollorenshaw, too; but poor Hannah Hewitt, who came stealthily and sought consolation in Mrs. Beare's good ale from the cuffs and ill-usage of her husband, was only wearisome in her cups, always complaining of being half-starved at home whilst he enjoyed himself abroad—a very skeleton at the banquet. So good Mrs. Beare, pitying the poor creature's forlorn state, consulted her handmaiden on the propriety of assisting her out of a world of woe, and the fair Rosamond having arrived, with butcher Hewitt, at the conclusion that when a vacancy occurred in Stepping-lane she should be called upon to fill it, entered "with a light heart" upon the scheme. Where three parties were so well agreed it was not thought necessary to ask the opinion of the fourth, and when, one Saturday, unhappy Hannah Hewitt came into the White Horse with the usual complaint of being clammed at home, what more natural than for the kind-hearted landlady who was getting ready for Shrovetide to invite her guest to eat a pancake in advance of that festive season?It was her last meal, for, in three hours after Mrs. Beare's hospitality to his wife, John Hewitt was free to marry Rosamond Ollorenshaw without fear of a prosecution for bigamy.

The skill of the Derby Borgia seems to have failed her at last, or her eagerness in this instance deprived her of caution; for a death so sudden, and so environed with the horrors of rapid, irritant poisoning, could not fail to arouse an suspicion; the neighbours cried Foul play! the Coroner was summoned, and a *post-mortem* examination revealed arsenic enough to have served Mrs. Beare for half-a-dozen of her peculiar patients instead of one only. Then, a public outcry arose, and almost with the avowed object of sparing Mr. Justice Lynch a task (for which he was quite prepared), all parties were taken on Sunday night and lodged in the prison in the Corn-market, which standing, then, on a site now occupied by part of the Royal Hotel buildings, gave it's name to the Jail Bridge spanning the brook at this point.

The assizes took place soon afterwards, and the historian observes that at the trial of the poisoners, Hewitt, finding that his doom was sealed, tried to save Rosamond, who seems to have been questioned in a manner not altogether in accordance with modern law; but Hutton shall here speak for himself:—"It is probable Hewitt had an affection for Rosamond; for the Judge having asked her whether Mrs. Beare was privy to the poisoning or ordered her to administer it, John trod upon her toe in order that she might tell the truth and save herself, but she unfortunately mistook the hint for its reverse and answered *No*; by which she saved the life of her mistress and lost her own." Mrs. Beare was acquitted, and her two less guilty associates were condemned to be executed. What follows presents a curious picture of Derby manners and customs nearly a century and a half ago. Samuel Drewry had (just about this period of our story), started a newspaper called *The Derby Mercury*, of which he issued "the first Paper *gratis* by way of Specimen" on the 23rd of March, 1732. The first regular number which follows is dated "No. I., Thursday, March 30, 1732," and furnishes the following particulars, which we re-print *verbatim et literatim*:—

> Derby, March 29. This day *John Hewitt* and *Rosamond Ollorenshaw* were executed here in pursuance of the Sentence passed upon 'em at the last Assizes for poisoning *Hannah Hewitt*, the wife of *John Hewitt*. he They confess'd their being guilty soon after Condemnation, and have since appeared very penitent. The Day before the Execution they each of 'em signed an open Confession of their Crimes and gave it to the Printer of this Paper and to no other, to be publish'd as a Warning to Others (it was accordingly printed and is now very much bought up). The Rev. Mr. *Locket* preached to the prisoners on the 27th inst. from *Matt.* 24, 44— *Be ye also ready*— And on the 28th the Rev. Mr. *Cantrell* preached to them from *Acts* 3 and 19 — *Repent and be converted*, &c. These Divines also attended them to the Place of Execution.

To hear these sermons the condemned prisoners were taken from the gaol to St. Peter's Church, and Hutton remarks that Rosaniond, being heavily fettered and half-dead with the apprehension of her approachbing fate, could scarcely rise from her knees, whereupon Hewitt "took her round the waist in the face of a crowded church and tenderly raised her." They walked to the place of execution (probably on the road to Normanton, although at the latter end of the 17th century the gallows stood upon Nun's Green), and Hutton is careful to record that Hewitt wore a suit of dark grey with black cuffs and trimmings, and that his unfrtunate partner in crime hung upon his arm dressed in a drab gown and a hat which nearly covered hr face. The *Derby Mercury* mentions that Hewitt took a book with him entitled "An Account of the Life and Death of Thomas Savage," and read in it most part of the way, which is not quite consistent with one's ideas of a walking procession; but both authorities agree in stating, as a singular circumstance, that each, upon arriving at the gallows stripped off their upper clothing, and presented themselves to the awe-struck gaze of "vast numbers of people who pitied and prayed for them;" attired in their grave-clothes. "There," says the old journalist, "both of 'em warned the Spectators, especially the younger People, to beware of bad Company and all wicked Temptations. J. Hewitt said if he had a thousand Worlds he would give them all so he might lead his life over again. It is hardly to be conceived with what Earnestness he continued praying for Mercy till the Cart was drawn awvay."

What became of the Landlady of the White Horse? Thereby hangs another tale which would be tedious to repeat at length here. She was seized in the night of the same day which witnessed the death of her wretched dupes, and an indictment was preferred against her at the next assizes, held at Derby on Tuesday, August 13th, before Mr. Justice Price, for "endeavouring to persuade John Wilson to poison his wife and for giving him poison for that end," and other charges scarcely less atrocious. These crimes being only known to the law of that day as "misdemeanours," this "wholesale dealer in human destruction," as Hutton calls her, was condemned to stand twice in the pillory the two first market days and suffer close imprisonment for three years. Hutton gives a graphic account of the terrible handling she received whilst pilloried on August 18th, at the hands of the enraged multitude; and from him we learn that at the close of her imprisonment, she, "having recovered her health, her spirits, and her beauty," was escorted home by the fickle populace in triumphal procession, preceded by a band of music. Our readers will agree with us in thinking that the annals of crime present few more striking examples than the career of the poisoners of the "Old White Horse" tavern in Friar-gate, a house which will soon be swept away before the advance of the Great Northern Railway through Derby.

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000052/18750217/015/0006
Derby Mercury - Wednesday 17 February 1875

William Hutton, the careful and sagacious historian of Derby, to whose labours all who follow in his footsteps ought to confess their obligations, was obliged to fall back upon his imagination when he searched Windmill Pit for the relics of Joan Waste, the Protestant martyr of Derby. By the help of his "infant imagination" he *believed* he discovered the remains of "burnt faggots" upon the spot; but (since the same veracious chronicle which, in 1556, records "Joan Waste was burnt to death in Windmill Pit in the Parish of St. Werburgh," also tells us that, in 1601, there was "a womnan burnt to death in Windmill Pit for poisoning her husband") our historian's fancy might just as well have supplied him with the ashes of the domestic traitress instead of those of the blind witness for Christ's truth, who suffered the cruel persecution of Queen Mary's butchers five-and-forty years before in the same place.

Windmill Pit must have been a fine site for an *auto-da-fé* in the days when the Romish party presented those edifying spectacles to the gaze of the people. Years ago, befora the borough extended itself in that direction, we remember it— a bold natural amphitheatre hollowed-out upon a hill-side overlooking the high road between Derby and Burton, far enough removed from the dwellings of the inhabitants, and, yet, answering the demands of the Queen's Warrant *De Haertico Comburendo*, which, informing the Bailiffs of Derby that Joan Waste being "pronounced, decreed, and declared to be an obstinate, contumacious and incorrigible Heretick and upon that occasion (i.e. of her trial) as a stubborn Heretick and rotten contagious Member fit only to be cut off from the Church of Christ and the Communion of the Faithful," directed them to commit "the same Joan Waste, being in their custody, publickly to the Fire before the People in a publick and open place within the borough of Derby for the cause aforesaid," and, that there might be no excuse for leniency on the part of the chief magistrate, "that you cause the said Joan Waste to be *really burned* in the said Fire, in Detestation of the said Crime, for the manifest example of other Christians, lest they slide into the same Fault, and this no ways omit under the peril that shall follow thereon."

Old Fox the martyrologist (whose "Acts and Monuments" were inspired by another bright matyr to Romish bigotry, the Lady Jane Grey shall tell the story of Joan Waste in his own quant diction. It has been reprinted in Simpson's fragmentary "History of Derby," and as a penny chap-book; but both as now scarce enough to justify us in including it in our list of old Derby stories:—

"The MARTYREDOME of JOANE WASTE, a blinde Woman in the Town of Darbie.

"The first day of August in the yeere 1566, suffered at the town of Darbie, a certeina poor honest godlie woman: being blinde from her birth, and unmarried, about the age of XXII, named Joane Waste, of the parish of Allhaliowes. Of them that sate upon this innocent womans bloud, the cheifest of them was Rafe Barn, Bishop of the Diocese, Dr. Draicot, his chancellour, Sir John Pert, Knight, Henrie Vernon, Esquire, Peter Finsh, Official of Darbie, with the assistance also of divers others, Richard Wards, and William Bembridge, the same time being Bailiffs of the towne of Darbie, &c. First after the aboue named Bishop and Dotcour Draicot, had caused the said Joane Waste to bee apprehended in the towne of Darbie, suspecting her to be guiltie of certeine heresies she was diuers times priuilie examined, as well in prison as out of prison, by Finsh, the official aforesaid: after that brought to public examination before the Bishop, at last, was there burnt in Darbie aboussaid, touchng whose life, bringing up, and conuersation, somewhat more amply we mean to discourse, as by faithful relation hath come to my handes.

"First this Joane Waste was the daughter of one William Waste, an honest poore man, and by his science a barber: who sometimes also used to make ropes.—His wife had the same Joane, and one other at a birth, and she was born blinde, and when she was about XII ort XIV yeeres olde, she learned to knit hosen and sleeues, and other things, which in time she could doe uerie well, furthermore as time served she would helpe her father to turne ropes and doe such other things as she was able, and in no case would bee idle. Thus continiued she with her father and mother during their liues: after whose departure, then kept she with one Roger Waste her brother, who in the time of K. Edward the Sixth, of blessed memorie, gaue herselfe, daylie to go to the Church to hear diuine seruice read in the vulgar tongue and thus by hearing homilies and sermons, she became marruellously well affected to the religion then taught, so at length having by her labour gotten and saued so much money as would buy her a New Testament, she caused one be prouided for her, and though she was of herselfe unlearned, and by reason of her blindness unable to reade, yet for the great desire she had to understand, and haue printed in her memorie the sayinges of Holy Scripture contained in the New Testament, she acquainted herselfe, chieflie with one John Hurt, then prisoner in the Common Hall of Darbie, for Debts. The same Juhu Hurt being a sober graue man, of the age of threescore and tennes yeeres, by her earnest intreatie, and being prisoner and many times idle and without companie, did for his exercise daylie read unto her some one chapter of the New Testament and if at any time he were otherwise occupied or letted through sickness, she would repair unto one John Pemerton Clerke of the Parish Church of All Saints in the same town of Darbie, or to some other person which could read, and some times she would giue a penie or two (as she might spare) to such persons as would not frelie read unto her, appointing unto them aforehand how manie chapters of the New Testament they shoulde reade or how often they shall repeats one chapter upon a price. Moreouer in the said Joan Waste, this was notorious, that she being utterly blinde, coulde notwithstandinig, without a guide, go to any Church in the said towne of Darhie, or to any other place or parson, with whom she had anie such exercise; by which exercise she so profited that she was able not only to recite many chapters of the New Testament without booke, but also could aptly impugne, by diuers places of Scriptures, as well sinne, as such abuses in religion as then were too much in use in diuers and sundrie persons, as this godlie woman thus daily increassad in the knowledge of God's holy word, and no lesse in her life expressed the uirtuosu fruits and exercise of the same; not long after, through the fatal death of blessed K Edward, followed the woefull ruine of religion in the raigne of Queen Marie his sister in which alteration notwithstanding the general backsliding of the greatest part and multitude of the whole realm, into the old papisme again,  yet this poore blinde woman continued in a constant conscience, proceeded still in her former exorcise, both being zealous in that shee had learned, and also refusing to communicate in religion with those that taught contrary docctrine to that shee before had learned in King Edward's time, as is aboue declared. For the which shee was called and conuented before the said Bishop and Dr. Draicot, with diuers others called in to bear witness.

"ARTICLES MINISTERED UNTO HER.

"The articles ministered unto her and wherewith she was charged, were these: First, that she did hold the Sacrament of the altar to be but a memrorie or representation of Christe's bodie, and material Bread and Wine, but not his natural bodie.

"Item, that shee did holde, in receiuing the sacrament of the altar, shee did not receiue the same bodie that was born of the Virgin Marie, and suffered upon the crosse for our redemption, &c.

"Item, shee did holde, that Christe at his last supper, did not blesse the bread that he had then in his hands, but was blessed himselfe, and by the uirtue of the words of consecration, the substance of the bread and wine is not conuerted and turned into the substance of the bodie and blood of Christe.

"Item, shee did graunt that she was of the Parish of All-Hallowes, in Darbie, &c. 

"Item, that all and singular the premises are true and notorious by public report and fame, &c.

"Whereunto shee answered, that shee belieued therein so much as the Holy Scriptures taught her, and according to that she had heard preached unto her by diuers learned men: whereof some suffered imprisonment, and other-some death, our for the same doctrine; amongst whom shee named, besides others, Dr. Tailour, whom shee said took it of his conscience, that that doctrine which he taught was true, and asked them, if they would doe so in like case for their doctrine, which if they would not, shee desired them for God's sake not to trouble her, being a blind, poore, and unlearned woman, with any further talke, saying (by God's assistance) that shee was ready to yeeld up her life in that faith in such sort as they should appoint.

"And yet, notwithstanding, being prest by the said Bishop and Dr. Draicot, with many arguments of Christe's omnipotencie, as why was not Christe able as well to make the bread his bodie as to turne water into wine, raise Lazarus from death, and such other like arguments; and many times being threatened with grievous imprisonments, torments and death; the poore woman thus being as it were, halfe astonied through their terrors and threats, and desirous (as it seems) to prolong her life, offered unto the Bishop then present that if he would before that companie take it upon his conscience, that the doctrine which he would haue her to belieue concerning the Sacrament, was true and that he would at the dreadful day of Judgment answere for her therein (as the said Dr. Tailour in diuers of his sermons did offer) she would then further answere them. Whereunto the Bishop answered he would, but Dr. Draicot his chancellour, hearing that, saide; my Lord, you know not what you do, you may in no case answers for an heretike. And immediately he asked the poore woman whether she would recant or no, and saide she should answere for herselfe. Unto whose sayings the Bishop also reformed himselfe. The poore woman perceiving this, answered again that if they refused to take of their conscience that it was true they would haue her to believe, she would answer no further, but desired them to doe their pleasure, and so after certeine circumstances, they pronounced sentence against her, and delivered her unto the Bailiffs of the said towne of Darbie aforenamed, who after they had kept her about a month or five weeks, at length, there came unto them a Writte De Haeretico Combureudo: by uirtue whereof they were appointed by the said Bishop, to bring her to the parish church of All-Saintes, at a day appointed, where Doctour Draicot should make a Sermon.

"When the day and time was come that this innocent martyre should suffer, first commeth Dr. Draicot, accompanied by diuers gentlemen, M. Thos. Powthread, M. Henrie Vernon; M. Dethicke, of Newall, and diuers others. This done, and all things now in readinesse, at last the poore blinde creature and seruant of God was brought and set before the pulpit, where the said Doctour being entered into his sermon, and there inueighing against diuers matters which he called heresies, declared unto the people that that woman was condemned for denying the blessed sacrament of the altar to be the verie bodie and bloud of Christ reallie and substantially, and was thereby cut off from the bodie of the Catholic Church, and he sayde, that she was not onlie blinde in her bodilie eyes, but also blinde in the eyes of her soule.—And he said, that as her bodie should he presentlie as consumed in material fire, so her soule should be burned in hell, in everlasting fire, as soone as it should be separated from the bodie, and there to remaine world without end, and saide it was not lawful for the people to pray for her: and so with manie terrible threats he made an end of his sermon, and commanded the Bailiffs and those Gentlemen to see her executed.

"And the sermon thus ended, after soone the blessed seruant of God was carried away from the said Church to a place called Windmill pitt, nere unto the towns and holding the aforesaid Roger Waste her brother by the hand she prepared herselfe, and desired the people to pray with her, and said such prayers as she before had learned, and cried upon Christ to haue mercy upon her as long as life serued. In this weane season, the said Dr. Draicot went to his Inn, for great sorrow of her death, and there lay'd him downe, and slept during all the time of her execution: and thus much of Joane Waste.

"Now, forasmuch as I am not ignorant faithful reader, that this and other stories more, set forth of the martyrs, shall not lacke carpers and markers enow, readie to seek all holes and corners how to defame the memorie of Gods good saints and to condemne these histories of lies and untruths, especially histories wherein they see there shameful actes and unchristian crueltie detected and brought to light: therefore for better confirmation of this historie aboue written, and to stop the mouths of such momes, this shall be to admonish all and singular readers hereof, that the discourse of this poor blinde womans life and death in such sort as is aboue prefixed, hath been confessed to be uery true, by the diuers persons of worthy credite and yet liuing: and also hath been specially perused and examined by W. Bainbridge before mentioned, Balife then of Darbie: who as well of his own knowledge, as by special enquiry and conference, by him made, with diuers others, hath certified us of the same, to be undoubted: besides the testimonial of John Cadman Curate of the saide Towne, and of others also, upon whose honestie well known, and their report heering nothing differing front such as were best acquainted with that matter, I haue been here the more bolde to commit this storie to posterite for all good men to consider and to judge upon."

Tradition informs us that when the poor blind girl was being fastened to the Stake, she asked those about her whither she had been brought. They answered, "To Windmill Pit." "Then look to it," she replied; "for never shall this pit, of which ye are about to make a pit of fire, hold drop of water more." And thirty years ago, when people had more time to cherish small superstitions than they have at present, strangers who were taken to see this historical spot were gravely informed that, although one-half of Derby might be submerged by the rising of waters consequent upon heavy rain, Windmill Pit would still be dry, "for the curse of Joan Waste clings to it."

LITERARY AND ANTIQUARIAN NOTES.

COLLECTORS OF "DERBYSHIRE" LITERATURE may not be aware that a very rare tract by Shelley, the poet (writing under the *nom de plume* of "The Hermit of Marlow"), entitled, "We pity the Plumage, but forget the dying Bird. An Address to the People of England on the Death of the Princess Charlotte," is devoted to a comparison between the national significance of the death of the Heir to the Throne and the execution of Brandreth, Ludlam, and Turner, at Derby, for high treason. A descriptive sketch of the scene on the scaffold is given with great rhetorical power. Thus, in dwelling upon the feelings of the survivors, the writer says:

What these sufferers felt shall not be said. But what must have been the long and various agony of their kindred may be inferred from Edward Turner, who, when he saw his brother dragged along upon the hurdle, shrieked horribly and fell in a fit, and was carried away like a corpse by two men. How fearful must have been their agony sitting in solitude on that day, when the tempestuous voice of horror from the crowd told them the head so dear to them was severed from the body! Yes—they listened to the maddening shriek which burst from the multitude; they heard the rush of the thousand terror-stricken feet; the groans and hootinge which told them that the mangled and distorted head was then lifted into the air. What Is Death? Who dares to say what will come after the grave?

When, in "Old Derby Stories Retold," we took the career of "The Nottingham Captain" and his deluded followers as a subject, we were unaware of the existence of this remarkable pamphlet, of which we have only recently been enabled to obtain a copy.

Derby Mercury - Wednesday 22 May 1878


THE LANCASHIRE RIOTS AND THEIR TEACHINGS.

We must turn back the pages of history to the early part of the present century for a parallel to the riots which during the past week have disgraced the cotton-working districts of Lancashire. The unreasoning folly of the Luddites and loom-breakers who (following the example of a poor idiot, NED LUD) commenced their depredations at Nottingham in November, 1811, is reproduced amongst us at the present time, aggravated in intensity by the natural tendency of Trades Unionism and the Communistic teachings of the working-class "leaders."

The masters, finding that the depressed state of trade is against their paying the high rate of wages which the operatives have of late been accustomed to receive, have stated their views and issued an ultimatum as they had a perfect right to do. On the other hand, the operatives, aiming at a policy which would send up prices by limiting production, hve declined to work at the lower rate, and we do not question their right to dispose of their labour as they see fit. As to the wisdom of allowing themselves to be forced into an unequal contest by their leaders, that is another matter—practically, the question, whether or no a man chooses to work under certain conditions, is one which must be decided by himself, since he, and those who belong to him, are chiefly affected by the matter at issue; but even those who justify "strikes," as being moral operations directed to the end of arresting over-production, will, we think, hesitate before they sanction the furious law-breaking of which we have now to write.

Reference to our news columns will show that, for the moment, the ordinary operations of the law are suspended in several large manufacturing towns; that violence is rampant and is only restrained from its extreme manifestation by the presence of an armed force. At Blackburn the rage of the mob vented itself not merely in a wholesale and wanton destruction of property, but in violence towards obnoxious individuals, and even towards women and children, from which it might have been hoped that the very mob had in England learned to abstain. Besides the wholesale smashing of mill windows, private residences suffered severely. The main victim of mob violence was Colonel JACKSON, the leader and supposed instigator of the masters in their policy of reduction. This gentleman's house was sacked and burnt, his wife and child were threatened and bruised, and the mob indulged in open threats of murderous intent against himself. This happened late on Tuesday night, and the rioters were so completely beyond the control of the police that the military had to be sent for from Preston, a garrison town, and one which, fortunately, is only nine miles from Blackburn. Other millowners' houses have been wrecked; black mail has been levied generally by the mob, numbering many thousands; and, in one case, vitriol-throwing has blinded a publican. The magistrates, police, and military have combined, not very successfully, to quell the riotous proceedings. The Riot Act has been read several times, but apparent timidity was displayed in enforcing its provisions. The roughs of Blackburn and other places until the military arrived were, in fact, too strong to be dealt with.

Now, we are told by certain writers (who are evidently most anxious that the principle which underlies Trades Unionism should not be blamed for these excesses) that "the bulk of the rioters are connected with no trade organization," and that "the responsible leaders of the operatives have urged them not to give riotous expression to their feelings;" but the common-sense of the country will, we feel assured, be opposed to the inferences which are sought to be thus drawn. The rioters themselves are actuated by motives which disprove the statement relative to their being unconnected with Trades Unionism, and the *Daily News*, a print not too favourable to the interests of capital as opposed to labour, notes the belief that "an organized outrage was deliberately planned and carried-out by hired ruffians" in Blackburn. The "responsible leaders" of the operatives will, of course, deny that they have encouraged their followers to commit outrages; and so, with equal propriety, might that individual have exonerated himself, who, seeing the mob in possession of the person of a pickpocket, implored them "not to duck him." "The masters have treated you contemptuously, and deserve punishment, but *don't burn their property*" was the advice of the "responsible leaders," and the workpeople responded to it, at once, by wrecking the private property and insulting the families of their employers!

Nine out of ten journalists in commenting upon these scenes of inconsiderate destruction, have called upon the "strong arm of the law" to inflict such punishment upon the rioters as shall effectually guard the community against such excesses in the future. There, is, however, something more to be done than the mere wreaking of vengeance upon the misguided people, who have scattered firebrands at the bidding of others more crafty and calculating than themselves. Hunger will break down stone walls, but the Lancashire rioters have not yet reached this pitch of desperation. The fomenters of the discord have been sorely disappointed, and their self-importance has been wounded by the resistance of the masters, who were expected to yield and have not done so. To this, and not to a more legitimate cause, must the incendiarism and other dastardly attacks on individuals and on property be referred. The leaders of trades' organizations in this country, and elsewhere, are doing all they can to pave the way for an attack upon property. Whilst doing their best to create and maintain a serious breach between capital and labour by inflaming the passions of the working classes, they are more or less unconsciously doing the work which the Communist plans. "Internationalism," as it is called, is the natural out-come of such lessons as were given to England by the school of which Mr. John Bright is a well-known teacher; it is opposed to patriotism and to all the qualities which, when found in individuals, tend to make the community to which they belong respected for its honesty and virtue; its ideas are mischievous, because they are selfish; and its agitation and clamour drowns the volce of reason whenever the prejudice in favour of "liberty of speech" gets the better of prudence and common-sense. These troublesome agitators are the men to be punished, and that with no lenient or sparing hand. Laah the men who breed discontent amongst the wage-earning class against the wealthy —whose seditious and inflammatory harangues arouse the passions of decent English-workmen to the pitch of incendiarism and brutal violence, of which we should think the Lancashire men must now be heartily ashamed. It is a *crime* to appeal thus to popular prejudices; to excite and intensify antagonism between capital and labour in the mines, in the iron trade, in the cotton and woollen factories, and on the railways;, and it is time that the law-abiding lovers of order and owners of property in this country and elsewhere understood the meaning of this great fact. The question is ceasing to be one of wages or hours of labour—the real point at issue is whether the State will longer sanction the ravings of Socialist agitators, who, pretending to advocate Trades-Unionism, are going about the country imposing their evil principles upon honest English workmen, and never losing sight of the opportunity of converting a temporary misunderstanding into an organized revolt.

LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS OF ENGLISH COUNTIES NOTTINGHAMSHIRE: BRADNRETH, "THE NOTTINGHAM CAPTAIN."—THE INSURRECTION AT PENTRIDGE AND BUTTERLEY.

IN TWO CHAPTERS. CHAPTER I.

In the year 1817, hard times and the popular discontent at Tory rule and the Tory reaction after the final victory of Waterloo, began to culminate. This angry restlessness at the Tory resistance to reform rose to its highest pitch, as might have been expected; not in the fat agricultural southern counties, where the labourers were as stupid as draught oxen and about as much their own masters; but in the midland and the northern counties, where skilled workmen congregated to discuss their intolerable grievances, and dreamt of some remedy, however desperate. The Prince Regent's vicious and selfish life had given a point to the demagogues of the day, and there is no doubt that "the first gentleman in Europe" was as much detested by the Radical mechanics of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, as if he had been a Tiberius in iniquity and a Nero in cruelty. To drive this discontent to some tangible shape, Lord Liverpool sent among those restless, turbulent, and ignorant, but sincere men, spies who were paid to urge them to open rebellion. Once in arms, Liverpool knew that he had the power to check all such troublesome reformers by blow of sword, or shock of bullet. In this mischievous and unrighteous way the malcontents were led to their ruin and their death. Of Brandreth, alias "the Nottingham Captain," who led this rising of 1817, little is known; but, according to local Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire tradition, he was a man of great power and energy, who in these dark times loomed suddenly like a giant on the horizon. In foolish Richard's time he might have been a Wat Tyler or an Artevelde. But coming in the Wellington epoch, he arose a mere ugly spectre to warn the coronetted obstructives of the danger of the eternal stagnation of Conservatism.

This petty revolution of two days assumed a visible form on Sunday morning the 8th of June, 1817, on the borders of Derbyshire, especially at Pentridge and Butterley. Early on that morning some iron founders, who had come from the iron works at Butterley to Pentridge on some gardening business, entered parlour of the White Horse in that place, and were astonished to find the room full of excited people (about forty), all gathered round a stern man in a brown great-coat and grey trousers, who sat at a central table, pointing out with his finger places on a map which lay before him. He was a stern, savage-looking fellow, and talked undisguised treason of the most outspoken and gory character. A fine young man with a florid complexion, named George Weightman, seemed to act as special henchman and aide-de-camp to Brandreth, "the Nottingham Captain," as this rebel leader was generally called by his followers; and near him stood another active adherent, a man afterwards hung and beheaded. Brandreth, whom every the new comer questioned as to their movements, repeatedly declared that nothing could be done till the Government was overthrown. Brandreth was pointing out to the workmen present the places (marked with crosses) on the canvas-lined map where their friends had agreed to assemble on the Monday night at dusk. The Pentridge people were to meet at Pentridge, the Wingfield people near a stone quarry. Others were to fall in at the border of Nottingham Forest at two on Tuesday morning as they marched on Nottingham. Brandreth promised also risings at Sheffield and Manchester and all at the same hour, ten o'clock on the Monday night.

Presently William Turner (another comrade of Brandreth, afterwards executed with him), came in and asked the Pentridge people for the list of their guns and pikes. On being told none had yet been made out, he said that his parish, Wingfield, was more forward than Pentridge, as they had noted down every gun, pistol, and sword in the parish, and had forty pikes to spare hid in a stone quarry. He then asked where the guns at Butterley were, and said that they must go and demand them, and if they were not quietly given up they must go in and take them. Then Brandreth, to whom every one appealed as to the hour of marching, the general rising, and the way of obtaining arms, recited the following verses of his own in a wild excited way—

Every man his skill must try,  
He must turn out and not deny;  
No bloody soldier must he dread,  
He must come out and fight for bread;  
The time is come, you plainly see,  
The Government oppos'd must be.

A man named Joseph Weightman was then sent off to Nottingham (fourteen miles distant), to see how their friends went on, money being first collected round the room for his expenses. This scout of the rebels carried a letter written by Brandreth. A man named Mac Kerswick then said, looking round the room, that he thought there were too many there for that business, and soon after went out, as if alarmed at the conspirators' daring.

In the course of this wild talk William Turner said, "The fact was, the badger must be drawn, and when he ran out, they would shoot him."

"In my own parish, Wingfield," Turner went on to say, "we have got some little vermin to kill, and we must kill them before we leave.""

Upon this, Anthony Martin, an iron worker from Butterley, who had dropped into the White Horse with a friend by accident, remarked "that they should mind, for there were constables in the room, himself and a man named Shirley Asbury," upon which Brandreth's men threatened to cram the two constables up the chimney. Brandreth, too, swore they would shoot any one that opposed them, or any one that said anything about them. The men present were iron founders, stocking makers, and field labourers, and all listened eagerly to the "Nottingham Captain." The rebels, confident of success, swore that every village should kill its own vermin, for that farm-yard metaphor seemed to exactly hit their fancy. They particularly spoke of firing straw before the door of Colonel Halton, a magistrate at Wingfield, and shooting him when he came out. Then they were to march on and meet Sheffield and Chesterfield at Butterley. There they had planned to kill Mr. Jessop, Mr. Goodwin, and Mr. Wragg, of the iron-works there, and to take were several men near the mysterious possession of the place. At Nottingham, Brandreth said there would be plenty of men and a hundred guineas each for them. It would be like a journey of pleasure, and they would after that go down the river (probably the Trent), and carry the game further. Brandreth, staunch to business and indifferent to loud chatter and vapouring rant, now wanted a barrel of gunpowder, that he might show the Pentridge men the way to make cartridges, the desire to possess and to burn which seemed fast spreading in this amiable society. Now and then he drew a favoured man aside, and talked with him under breath, and so the lava began to creep and creep from the crater.

On Monday night, the ninth of June, about half-past eight, a labourer of Southwingfield, named Shipman, was standing at the door of the house where he lodged. Brandreth, George Weightman, and some others came up, and Shipman, knowing Weightman, asked him where they were going. Weightman replied, "To an old barn up in the field, where there was to be a meeting of the towns of Wingfield, Critch, Pentridge, and Alfreston. There were arms and powder there, and more would be found on the way to Nottingham. A band of music and thousands of friends were to meet them at Nottingham forest. There would be plenty of churches along the road to get lead from for bullets. At Nottingham there would be bread, beef, and half a pint of rum for every man."

"But what about the poor women and children?" cried Shipman.

Brandreth said that a provisional government would be formed in London, and sent down to the country to relieve the wives and children of those who had gone on the march.

An old woman standing by tapped Brandreth on the shoulder at this, and said, "My lad we have got a magistrate here."

Brandreth replied, "Ah! but you will soon have a different one from your one, that will allow you plenty." And went on to say that England, Ireland, and France were all to rise that night at ten o'clock, and the northern clouds would come and sweep all before them, and every man that refused to go should be shot on the spot.

This conversation took place opposite the meeting-house at Southwingfield, very near to Colonel Halton's gate. There were several men near the mysterious "Nottingham Captain" at the time, and all of them (strange to say) carried guns; and William Turner began loading his piece with bullets as he walked on to what seemed a rendezvous at Hunt's barn, a lonely, disused place in a field of Colonel Halton's.

"Come, lads," cried George Weightman; "I expect an engagement very soon with Jessop's men at Butterley furnace."

Thomas Turner, a man to whom Brandreth had promised a good gun if he  marched with them, then asked William Turner who the stranger (Brandreth) was, to which Turner replied—

"Our captain from Nottingham."

About a hundred yards further, astonished Turner saw about a score of men pour out of the at first apparently deserted old barn. They all carried, Turner could see, as they approached, pikes, swords, or guns. On Weightman's deciding to meet the Pentridge people in the field of a man named Topham, Brandreth marshalled the men into ranks; and Thomas Turner had a bag of bullets given him to carry, as he preferred that passive occupation to carrying a gun. The next step was to go round to hostle houses and obtain arms by fair means or foul.

One of the first demands for arms was made at the house of a farmer named Tomlinson, at Southwingfield. We gather from his evidence at Brandreth's trial, at Derby, the following particulars:—

Henry Tomlinson deposed "that on Monday night, the ninth of June, about half-past nine, or a quarter before ten, a man came to him from Mr. Hardwick's house—it is not a quarter of a mile. He gave him some information, in consequence of which he locked the house door and went out with his wife into the yard; they staid there about ten or fifteen minutes before he saw anybody come, then a body of men came to the house, and came in at one end of the yard; there appeared to him to be between thirty and forty, some of them were armed with pikes, and some with guns; the pikes were such as he saw then on the table. When they came to the door, they began to rattle it; he asked them what they wanted; they said, 'You and your gun.' He does not know whether the prisoner was there; he said they should have neither; he had a gun, but it was gone to Ashover to be mended. The person whom they called captain asked for him and his gun, but it was too dark to see his person.

The captain said if he did not open the door they would break it; that they would search the house. As the witness was going up to the door, he saw William Turner, he also saw William Barker, and he said to each of them 'Are you one, William ?' and both of them said 'Yes.' He unlocked the door, and went in, and the captain and another man followed him. He had left his gun on the bed tester; he brought it down, the captain demanded it from him, and he delivered it to him; the captain took it out of doors, and he went and stood close to the door, and the captain said, 'You must go along with us.' He said he would not go, they said he must go— he had better go that night than stop till morning; that if he stopped till morning, there was a great gang coming from Sheffield, and a great cloud out of the North, which would sweep all before it. He said he would not go that night, that if he must go, he would stay till the morning; and then the captain cocked his gun, and presented it at him, and swore he would shoot him if he would not go. Then he said, 'No, no, I will not stand out; I will go a little way, but it shall not be far.' Before the captain threatened to shoot him some cried out, 'Smite his head off;' others cried, 'Let him go,' and others said, 'Never mind him;' then he says the captain said they were going to Nottingham, and must be there between eight and nine o'clock; that it would not be necessary to go further than Nottingham, for London would be taken before they got there. The witness said to George Weightman, 'Are you one?' and he said 'Yes.' He said he thought it a very hard thing to take him from that
lonely place, and to leave his wife behind; he said, 'It is to go a little way, and you may turn back again.' and they gave him a pike like one of those on the table; he asked them to let him carry his own gun, the captain said he should not, and they gave him a pike. He went about three hundred yards with them, and then George Weightman bid him give him the pike, and he did, and got home."

At the farm of Mrs. Hepworth, in Southwingfield Park, the first blood was shed; in fact, a cold-blooded murder was committed. At the trial, this farmer's wife deposed the following:—

"I occupy a farm in Southwingfield Park. On the ninth of June last, at night, one son, two daughters, two men servants, and myself, were the family in the house. My family were disturbed that night by a large number thundering at the door, demanding my guns and servants. In consequence of that I got up and went down-stairs, and called out 'The door is not to be opened,' for I would not part with the men and guns. They afterwards attacked the windows on both sides of the house; the kitchen-window towards the back of the house was broken, I did not see by whom; the shutters were forced into the middle of the room, and they broke the glass quite out, and it fell both ways; myself, my son William, my daughter Emma, and two men servants, Robert Fox and Robert Walters, were all in the kitchen. The people on the outside of the house said to my son William, 'We must have your guns and your men, or we will blow your brains ont.' After the window was broken they fired immediately. Robert Walters was shot dead almost instantly; he died in a few minutes after he received the wound. He was sitting down on a chair, opposite the window, as I thought, to put on his boot; he was shot in the right side of the neck. They still went on demanding the guns."

Directly the kitchen window fell in, and the cruel shot was fired, Mrs. Hepworth said to her small and frightened garrison—

"We must give up the guns, or we shall all be murdered."

A gun, which had been hid away in the cellar for safety, was then eagerly fetched up and delivered to Brandreth, who had himself fired the murderous shot; but the stubborn farmer's wife still refused the men.

"You shan't have the men," she cried; "you have shot one already."

Brandreth's party replied, "We will serve you the same, unless you let us have the other man."

They did not, however, commit any more acts of violence; but after they were gone, the reassured men at Hepworth's found several large stones near the door, and a pike, which had been used to drive the door in.

Elijah Hall's was another house (about a quarter of a mile from Langley Park) which the Brandreth party attacked at Southwingfield. Elijah had returned home from his mill that Monday night about eleven p.m. Ten minutes after he heard footsteps at the door. Presently rough voices asked if any men had been there that night for guns; and, to get "shut" of them, Hall slyly answered that some men had been before, and taken away all the guns he had. The party then went away; but, five minutes after, some thirty men, armed with guns and pikes, came into the yard, and demanded muskets; when he denied that he had any fire-arms. They told him that he had better deliver them quietly, or the house would be fired, and he would lose his life. All this time poor Elijah was trembling in the courtyard, locked out by his own garrison, who had turned the key when the good man ventured forth to parley. He was told by the besiegers that he had better open the door. Rushes were then made at the door; but, these failing, they cried out to Brandreth, "Captain, how must it be?" An order was then bellowed to fire at the door, if it was not opened at once. The garrison, upon that, came to terms, a window was opened, a gun handed out, and the door was opened. Brandreth then insisted that Elijah Hall should go with them; but Hall resolutely refused. One of the party, however, cried, "He has sons." And Brandreth said, "If he has sons, we will have them." They told Hall that they wanted a bigger loaf and the times would be altered. The Nottingham Captain and about a dozen others then went into the house.

As they pushed in, Brandreth said to Elijah—

"I'll blow your brains out, if you don't get your sons up quickly."

On Hall's saying he would not give them up, Brandreth cursed him, gave him two pushes with the muzzle of his gun, and, on his still refusing, presented his gun, and, on a third refusal, cocked it. But William Turner cried, "Don't;" and others cried, "We will fetch them out of bed ourselves." Brandreth then lit a candle at the fire and went up-stairs, rummaging about with his men. There was a great noise and wrangle, till they descended, bringing Elijah's boys, partly dressed; but they found no more guns, though there were several concealed. On Hall asking the captain whither he was bound, he replied with frankness—

"To Nottingham, which would be taken by that time, as there was a general rising throughout the country; and it was their intention to wipe off the National Debt, and begin all fresh. They should pull down the Parliament House, and break up the old laws."

The rioters were formed two deep, and sergeants had been appointed to command the different divisions. At the Bull Hill, at the end of Pentridge, they were halted a quarter of an hour, and near the meeting-house Brandreth fired his gun, to warn the Ripley and Butterley people. James Weightman had a hat full of bullets. As the Captain's little army knocked at many doors and truculently demanded arms, and at one house took out a pony, to mount a messenger for Nottingham.

At Butterley, Brandreth and his men halted at the furnace gate of Mr. Jessop's iron-works, and knocked; on Mr. Goodwin, the managing clerk, coming out, Brandreth told him he wanted his men. In his evidence at the trial, Mr. Goodwin deposed—

"We had, before Monday the ninth of June, many of our men sworn in as special constables—about a hundred of them; the neighbourhood was in a very disturbed state," he says. "I brought my men together on the night of the ninth of June, and I kept them at Ripley till day-light in the morning. In the course of the night I heard guns fired, horns blowing, shouts and different noises throughout the night at a distance; the first shot I heard was about twelve o'clock; we had seen and heard noises before in the villages; it appeared as if there was something very unusual going on. I apprehended that our works would be attacked when daylight came," this being in June, "the greater part of my men went home, the others, twelve or thirteen, stayed at the works." . . . "When they came to the door of the foundry, Brandreth gave them the word, 'halt, to the right face, front,' and they did so. The prisoner had a gun in his hand, a pistol in a belt like an apron, twisted round; the men formed a sort of curved line opposite the gate; the prisoner knocked at the gates with the butt end of his gun; I asked him, 'What do you want, what is your object here?' He said, 'We want your men.' I said, 'You shall not have one of them. You are too many already, unless you were going for a better purpose. Disperse, depend upon it the law will be too strong for you; you go with halters round your necks, you will all be  hanged'— the prisoner made no reply to this."

After an episode at the Butterley Iron Mills, where Brandreth was boldly confronted, the rebels marched round the works, and, returning to the turnpike-road, made straight for Ripley Town End, where they halted and shouted three times, to summon the Heage and Belper people, from whom a detachment was expected. They then moved on to Cudnor, on the high road to Nottingham; and from thence to Langley Mill, where they forced a gun and a recruit from Mr. Raynor. At Langley Mill they met George Weightman returning from Nottingham; and, as he rode along the ranks, he replied to several questions about the state of things in Nottingham, by saying all was going on well: the soldiers kept quiet in barracks; the town was taken, and all they had to do was to march forward.

A little before twelve on the same night as these various events occurred, namely, Monday, the ninth of June, 1817, William Roper, a man who lived in the stand at the race-course, in the centre of Nottingham Forest, three quarters of a mile from Nottingham, was returning to his home from the town, was warned of danger, and soon after saw about a hundred men, armed with poles and pikes, standing in a line, two deep. As Roper and the man who had warned him were hurrying off the race-course to escape these men, ten of them followed Roper and his friend, and brought down their pikes to the charge to stop them. Roper reached his house with his friend, and soon after the men drew up under the stand, as if waiting for something. They knocked at Roper's door, and demanded fire-arms. Roper owned he had some, but told them he would not deliver them up; and they told him, if he did not, they should be under the necessity of breaking open the door and taking them by force.

"If you do so," cried Roper, "I will blow out the brains of the first man that enters."

They replied, "Will you?" and a man (probably Brandreth) then shouted for the men with the fire-arms to come forward. It must have been an anxious moment for Roper. There was a bustle on the flagstones under the race-stand piazzas before his door; but, nevertheless, no attempt was made to force an entry. They merely asked what fire-arms he had, and learning that he had a rifle piece and a fusee, they asked him to give it them or sell it to them, and at the last refusal marched quietly on.

LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS OF ENGLISH COUNTIES.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE: BRANDRETH, "THE NOTTINGHAM CAPTAIN." — THE INSURRECTION AT PENTRIDGE AND BUTTERLEY. IN TWO CHAPTERS. CHAPTER II.

At the trial, Henry Hole, of Pentridge, deposed the following—

"I asked Brandreth's men where they were going to; 'to Nottingham,' they said; I said I could not pretend to go with them, I had no money to carry me there, nobody to take care of my family while I was gone; they said I needed no money, I should be kept on roast beef and ale, and there were people fixed to take care of everybody's family, who would come in two days or under; they said I had better go with them that night than stop till morning, for they were coming from Yorkshire like a cloud, and would drive all before them, and those that refused to go would be shot. I then dressed myself and went out, and a pike was forced upon me. I said I was not able to carry that pike, if they were going as far as Nottingham; that they must either take it, or I must hurl it down, and one of them took it. . . . As we approached Eastwood, I had some conversation with James Barnes; he said they were going to Nottingham; that they had fixed a fresh government at Nottingham, and were going thither to defend it; it will soon be all over, for by a letter I saw yesterday, the keys of the Tower would be given up to the Hampton club party, if they were not already; he said, 'I have never sat down five minutes at once since four o'clock yesterday morning; I have been providing guns, pikes, and ammunition ;' in the course of the conversation, Barnes said they were going to stay at Nottingham till other counties came into their measures; at Eastwood, the men appeared again disordered, and Brandreth the captain, the prisoner, ordered them again into the ranks; I turned out of the ranks and stood at some distance, and the prisoner came to me and ordered me into the ranks again. I said, 'I will not go in again for you or any other man.' He came up to me, cocked the gun, and said if I did not go in again immediately, he would shoot me in a moment. I stepped up to him with the knife (which he had described before) in my hand, held it over his neck, and said, if he offered to level his gun at me I would hack his head off; he turned off from me, and I walked off down the turnpike road, as if toward Langley Mill; when I was about fifty or sixty yards off I heard a cry of 'Do not shoot,' I turned round and saw Brandreth with a gun on his shoulder, pointing to me, and at the same time I saw a man of the name of Thomas Turner, take hold of him, and turn the gun off."

In the course of the trial the proprietor of the iron-works at Butterley deposed—

"I observed in the ranks some persons whom I knew; I saw Ludlam the elder, he was armed with a spear; James Taylor, a nephew of Isaac Ludlam's, he was armed with a gun; Isaac Moore, he was armed with a fork; they were all three together in the front rank. I said to Isaac Ludlam, 'Good God, Isaac, what are you doing upon such a business? you have got a halter about your neck; go home.' I took him by the shoulder and pushed him towards the office. I told him if he had any regard to his family or country to go home. I was then in the ranks close to him; he might have taken refuge in our office at that time. He said, 'I am as bad as I can be, I cannot go back, I must go on;' he was exceedingly agitated when I talked to him, and neither of the three took refuge in our office, but others who were there did; Mr. Hugh Booth and Mr. William Booth's servant, and a Turner of Pentridge-lane, and got into the office, and I sheltered them; alter a short pause, and looking at each other, the prisoner gave the word, 'March,' and they marched on towards Ripley; they went first over the coke hearth and then came back again, and finally went towards Ripley. Shortly after they were gone I observed another body of men, amounting to forty or fifty; they did not come so near as the office; sometime after they were gone I saw William Weightman, George's brother, on horseback, another man of the name of Taylor was with him, the brother of Weightman's wife; they were going towards Nottingham; he followed in the same line that the others had gone, but he went a more direct way to Nottingham; I pushed out and took hold of his bridle and stopped him, I said, 'You are going to join those fellows ;' he admitted he was going to join them, and said, if I would let him go back he would go home and not go near them.' He resisted at first, saying that I had no right to stop him on the highway; he turned his horse's head, and when he went to a little distance I observed he had a bag under him. He was dressed in a blue smock frock which concealed the bag before; it struck me when he turned, and I saw it, that that bag must be bullets, and then I dashed at his horse and seized it by the bridle; I told him I must have that bag; he said I should not, I had nothing to do with it. I said, I have, you rascal, they are bullets, and you are taking them to join the rebels.' I took him by the collar and was pulling him down from his horse, and he said he would give them up quietly, that they were bullets; he was obliged to do it, he said, for they had threatened his life if he did not. I found about eighty-four pounds of bullets in the bag, and an instrument for making cartridges with them."

From Codnor it was proved that Brandreth and his men had proceeded towards Langley Mill; in their way between Codnor and Langley Mill they called at the house of a person called Sterland, and insisted upon arms; and three persons having secreted themselves in a barn belonging to that house, and hearing this noise, and watching the party, inadvertently came out of this barn before they had all gone by; they were seen by the prisoner, Turner, and others of the conspirators, and William Turner was most active in endeavouring to force these persons into the ranks; and so far from having any compunction at the unfortunate act they had committed at Mrs. Hepworth's, it was now used by Turner as an inducement to these persons to come into their wicked designs and join their party; for he intimated to them they would follow the fate of that unfortunate person at Mrs. Hepworth's, if they attempted to oppose the design they had in view. They then proceeded to the house of a person of the name of Raynor, where the greatest resolution was displayed by the young, Mr. Raynor, for he opposed their designs, although threatened in the most violent manner; he disregarded their threats, threats referring to the unfortunate and melancholy transaction at Mrs Hepworth's.

But the bubble was soon to burst. The rising was but a nine hours' wonder. Revolutionists are always sanguine. The country did not rise in its thousands as such resolute fanatics as the Nottingham Captain had felt confident it would. On the ninth there was a ground swell of excitement at Nottingham, and groups of irresolute people collected in the streets, and the faces of rich men's wives and children grew pinched and pale and anxious; but after all, the lightning of an injured people's wrath fell not. At half past six a.m. on the tenth the Tory gentry, encouraged by the failure of the insurrection, rose sword in hand. Lancelot Rolleston, of Watnall, an active county magistrate, mounted and rode early on the dangerous road towards Eastwood. He found the people alarmed, gathered on the road outside their houses, and conscious of some coming evil.

A quarter of a mile from Eastwood the magistrate's keen eye observed in the distance a body of rough men on foot armed with pikes. He instantly turned his horse and spurred off to the nearest barracks for troops. At the barracks he found Mr. Mundy and Mr. Kirkly, both fellow Nottinghamshire magistrates, conferring, and he at once procured eighteen men of the fifteenth Hussars, commanded by Captain Philips and a subaltern, and marched on Eastwood. When he and the Hussars had jolted and jingled as far as Kimberley, four miles from Nottingham, and about two from Eastwood, the country people they met informed them that the rioters had gradually dispersed and the recruits stolen away; and as the Hussars dashed on to Eastwood after them, they came on a litter of guns and pikes, the debris of the scattered rioters. Half a mile from Eastwood the chivalrous Rolleston and one dragoon dashed off down a turning to the left after a party of thirty or forty pikemen whom they saw dispersing in the distance and throwing away their arms that impeded their flight. They captured two or three, then turned to Eastwood, and rejoined the main body of Hussars. Between Langley Mills and Eastwood the soldiers came on another body of men, mostly armed. There was a man (probably the staunch Brandreth) trying to form them by motions of his hand; but the men had lost heart; they were disorderly and disregarded him, and presently all but five or six fled, and the rest, with arms still in their hands, were ridden down and taken. At Eastwood the soldiers met the high sheriff with the Nottinghamshire yeomanry in hot pursuit of the insurgents. Near Langley Mills Thomas Hallowes of Glapwell Hall, the high sheriff, captured the Turners and several other insurgent leaders. Brandreth, subtle and determined, was not captured till the twenty-second of July, when he was taken by the Nottingham constables. George Weightman, of Pentridge, was found at Sheffield, and Isaac Ludlam, the elder, near Uttoxeter. Both were captured by Messrs. Fletcher, Booth, and Laster, natives of Pentridge. Two others were captured at St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire, after a desperate resistance.

In Derby town repressive measures were also put in force. The Rev. Charles Stead Hope, mayor of the borough, and others, were assisted by the aldermen, Messrs. Ledger and Lowe: a company of the Ninety-fifth Regiment was on duty all the night of June nine, and the next day; two troops of Derbyshire Yeomanry, under Major Sir R. Wilmot, of Chaddesden, arrived in the town. The Calke and Ashburn yeomen were called out and sent towards Langley-bridge, and were there joined by the Chestertield troop under Captain Wright.

Jeremiah Brandreth, alias John Coke, alias "The Nottingham Captain," was tried, with eighteen of his men, before a special commission, in the Old County Hall, at Derby, on 16th of October. This man, as resolute as Wat Tyler and as unfortunate, preserved a stern ferocity; but, towards the close of the trial, he grew deadly pale, yet still made great efforts to answer important questions with a ghastly smile. The judges at this trial were Sir Richard Richards, Sir Robert Dallas, Sir Charles Abbot, and Sir George Holroyd. Copley was among the counsel for the crown; while Denman and Cross appeared for Isaac Ludlam, one of Brandreth's companions. It was in the course of the trial of Ludlam that Denman quoted, apropos of Brandreth, Byron's powerful lines in the Corsair, which were thought very applicable to this determined ring-leader.

But who that chief? His name on every shore  
Is famed and feared—they ask and know no more.  
With these he mingles not but to command—  
Few are his words, but keen his eye and hand.

His name appals the fiercest of his crew,  
And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;  
Still sways their souls with that commanding art  
That dazzles—leads—yet chills the vulgar heart.  
What is that spell, that thus his lawless train  
Confess and envy—yet oppose in vain?  
What should it be, that thus their faith can bind?  
The power, the nerve, the magic of the mind!  
Link'd with success—assumed and kept with skill,  
That moulds another's weakness to his will—  
Wields with their hands— but still to these unknown,  
Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.  
Unlike the heroes of each ancient race,  
Demons in act, but gods at least in face,  
In Conrad's form seems little to admire,  
Though his dark eyebrows shades a glance of fire;  
Robust, but not Herculean—to the sight  
No giant frame sets forth his common height;  
Yet on the whole—who paused to look again,  
Saw more than marks the crowd of common men.  
They gaze and marvel how—and still confess  
That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.  
Sun-burnt his cheek—his forehead high and full,  
The sable curls in wild profusion veil;
There breathe but few whose aspect could defy  
The full encounter of his searching eye;  
There was a laughing devil in his sneer,  
That raised emotions both of rage and fear;  
And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,  
Hope withering fled—and Mercy sighed farewell!

The trial ended with Brandreth, Turner, and Ludlam being sentenced to death for high treason.

It is uncertain, after all, whether this remarkable and mysterious man, Brandreth, was an Irishman or a Devonshire man. It is supposed that he had been alternately a drover, a whitesmith, a sailor, and a stocking maker. By the advice of the debtors in the Derby prison, he resolutely maintained to the last that he had fallen a victim to the machinations of Oliver, the Government spy.

On being pressed to disclose his motives for the course which he took, Brandreth said that was a matter between himself and his Maker, to whom he had already opened his heart. He wished that no question might be asked him which would involve others. He was answerable for the crimes he had himself committed, and hoped he should die as became a Christian. With regard to the murder of Mrs. Hepworth's servant, that he did not seem to view in the light of a crime. He appeared to think himself rather as a general officer, who had been assigned a certain duty, in the furtherance of which he had to This accounts for his expressions when up-braided with the act at the time, by Thomas Turner—"It was my duty" he said. Throughout, in fact, he seems to have had no consciousness of moral guilt, but viewed his offences entirely as political. His mind was at all times cool and collected, his answers to questions quick and apposite; the tones of his voice were deep and sonorous, and not unpleasing. He was evidently much hurt when viewed as a mere object of idle curiosity, and looked sternly in the faces of those who occasionally gazed upon him. The language of kindness always, however, softened the asperity of his manner. His pipe was his constant solace and companion, and when not engaged in prayer, he engaged himself in writing on the blank pages of the list of witnesses who were subpoenaed on his trial, and with which he had been furnished. This led to a belief that he was writing the history of his life. His writings consisted only of prayers of his own composition, composed with great energy.

When asked whether he had any reason to allege why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, he replied, "Let me address you in the words of our Saviour: 'If it be possible, let this cup pass from me; but not my will, but the Lord's be done.'" The other three men who had been tried, expressed a hope for the mercy of the court.

The terrible execution of this chief of the insurgents took place in Nun's Green, opposite the Derby County Gaol, a few days after the trial. Brandreth entered the prison chapel that morning with his usual indifference. The service over, he tumbled himself on the sledge that was to drag him round the prison-yard, calling out, "You must hold my hand, or I shall fall off." He took Turner by the hand in the prison-passage, and the two men kissed each other. While Ludlam was being drawn round the yard, Brandreth said to Turner—

"Well, we shall now soon be above the sky, where there will be joy and glory for ever and ever."

"Yes," cried Turner, with enthusiasm; "there will be no sorrow there; all will be joy and felicity."

The chaplain, who stood by, encouraged these thoughts; Isaac Ludlam said nothing, but prayed by himself. Brandreth said he was quite ready to die, and felt no fear at all. He mounted the steps first, preceded by the executioner and his assistant. As he trod the scaffold, he said, "God bless you all, but Lord Castlereagh." When Turner came up, he exclaimed wildly, "This is all Oliver and the Government; the Lord have mercy on my soul!" When Isaac Ludlam ascended the ladder, and the rope was dropped over his head, he uttered the following prayer—

"O Lord, forgive my sins, receive my soul, and grant that I may meet all this great concourse of people in heaven. Bless the king of this nation, bless the people, bless all the people, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free; yea, bless all, from the king upon his throne down to the meanest subject in the realm, and may this awful dispensation be made a blessing to thousands, and tens of thousands. O Lord, receive my spirit."

The three men then repeated the Lord's Prayer with the chaplain; Ludlam was still praying aloud when the bolt was drawn. After the bodies had hung half an hour, sawdust was strewn on the platform, and a bench, a block, two axes, two sharp knives, and a basket were brought up. The bodies were then cut down and laid on a bench, the caps removed, and the heads chopped off. Directly Brandreth's head fell in the basket, the hangman seized it by the red dripping hair, and held it up to the left, the right, and front of the scaffold, exclaiming—

"Behold the head of the traitor Jeremiah Brandreth !"

It was the same with the rest. On the prison caravan arriving, the coffins, on the lids of which the three men's names were written in chalk, were slid in and driven to St. Weyburgh's church. There, without being stripped, the three bodies were at once thrown into a deep grave; Brandreth at the bottom.

Thirty-one other prisoners were acquitted by the wish of the Government. With better opportunities and a nobler purpose, Brandreth, the Nottingham Captain, might have developed into a hero.
