TO DO

STATE TRIALS. THIRD DAY— -tkrbt, Oct 17. At half-past seven this morning the prisoner Brandreth was brought from the gaol in the same manner as yesterday, linked to the arm of Mr. Eaton, and in the prison caravan. He was smoking a short pipe as he passed along, and seemed to maintain a perfect equanimity. There was not a single individual accompanying the caravan, save the officers of police. Among the inhabitants of tho town, all is at present peace and quietHess, as we before stated: however, persons are not wanting to endeavour to produce a different feeling; among other means taken to effect an object which it is unnecessary to explain, some of those persons to whom we allude, have written in conspicuous parts ofthe town, and particularly on the wall of All Saints' Church, in large letters, the words "Jurymen, remember Oliver." The crowd pressing for admission to the Court this morning was not less numerous than yesterday; and on the doors being opened, every vacant space soon found an occupant. Lord and Lady Scars- oale were on the JJench with the Judges; and the more select parts of the Court were filled with per- sons of respectability, male and female. Mr. Hunt, of Bristol, was also present. At eight o'clock the Judges entered the Court, and in a few moments afterwards the Jury, who had been under the care of four officers during the night, at the King's Arms Tavern, where every accommo- dation-had been provided for them, were ushered into Court and called over. The prisoner was then put to the bar, and the foi 1 1) wing witnes_.es were examined:— * Mary Kptvorlh, Ihe mistress of the servant, Robert Walker, who was shot by a nun fired through the window: Samuel I- In- citer, whose house had been broken open, and who was forced to give tip his gun and his servant to liie rioters; William Ship- man, the servant so forced a miy, and who gave an account of Ihe matching and cnunlermarchmg of these outrageous vagi- bonds; Henry Hale, a farmer, who had been forced tojoin litem, and who deposed lo a speech, saying, that now the lime was come to fight or starve, and whom the mob encouraged to accom- pany iliero by the promise of roast beef and ale, and a fresh Government, which Mr. Cross, in his cross-examination of th">s wilness, called a provisional Government. William Kootb, ano- ther person forced away, also deposed lo the co untermarclies of The rioters. George Goodwin, manager of the iron-works al Rtitterley, deposed to the general nppearunce of the rioters, their order, and their arms, ll was he who look the ammuni- tion from one of them, and which, by a curious coincidence wi.h Watson's case, consisted of bullets partly thrust into the foot of an old stocking, and the rest loosely lying in an old sack : al- together, il consisted of about 84 pounds weight. W. Roper also bore testimony to the regular array of the rioters. Mr. Kallestnn, a magistrate of Nottingham, aud Captain Phillips, of the 15th dragoons, deposed to Ihe easy dispersion of Ihe ranks of the rioters, and to the subsequent apprehension of several offbeat. The evidence for the prosecution concluded a little before 12 o'clock. Tbe Juiy having retired and returned in a few minutes, Mr. Cross began bis speech for the defence exactly at twelve o'clock. The Learned Counsel spoke for about two bour... tie began by staling the law of treason, and expressing his dissent from the doctrines laid down by the Attorney General, founded nn the exposition of the statute of Edward 111. by Justice roster, and oilier law authorities. He traced the progress of the law from Edward downward, and the various encroach- ments made in the reign of Edward VI. and y _crn Mar}.— He showed how the famous statute of Kdward 111. had been tendered uugatory by forced interpretations and arbitrary construction., or what were called constructive treasons. At ihe accession of the reigning family to the throne, the Riot Act had been made, and constructive treasons were abolished. This celebrated Act, by applying a particular punishment to riot, and describing what was to be considered as tumult or riot, as distinguished from treason, rendered the doctrine of constitutive treason useless for the protection of the pub- lic peace, and sufficiently explained what was meant by levying war. Levying of war was different from mere tu- mult; and Ihe prisoners, though guilty of the latler, were oot affected by any evidence that was brought to prove ihetn guilty of the former. There had been trials in Derby for high treason, but these happened nftor a rebellion, in wbich there was a great army employed on the side of Ihe rebels to over.hrow the Government. There had been only two attempts at constructive treason since the accession of the Brunswick Family, and these happened in the case of Lord G. Gordon, and in the trial of Wats .n, in Westminster. Both attempts were defeated, though the most violent outrages hy tumultuous assem- blies were committed in both cases. The Learned Counsel llien went over the circumstances of the case before Ilia Jury, and contended lhat ihey came only under the description of riot, and not of high treason. He gave a detail of ihe causes ofthe di.roi_i.nts of last year, and spoke in severe lerms of Cobbelt and his cheap publications. He commended Lord Sidmoutli's circular with respeci to the taw of libel, and thought that such publications as Cobbetl's should have been sooner stopped. When l_e Learned Counsel concluded, a Wilness was called to prove thai the Prisoner had received parish aid. .Vlr. I) en man now addressed the Courl and Jury on the same side with Mr. Cross, and took the same line of argument. The Chii:f Baron then asked Ihe Prisoner if he wished to address any observations to the Jury; to which the Prisoner said, he would leave his case to his Counsel. Ihe Solicitor-General then addressed the Jury in reply, on the part of the Crown, in an able and argumentative speech, which occupied the attention of ihe Court for two hours. The Chief Baron postponed summing up the evidence till to-morrow morning. The Court then adjourned till eight o'clock to-morrow. The Prisoner wus then re-conducted to prison in the usual way.

FOURTH DAY. —Derby, Oct. 18. CHARGE TO THE JURY. The Chief Baron, soon after eight, addressed the Jury to this effect:— I must now request your attention while I state the evidence in this case, and suggest the observations that occur to me; and, in order to remove from your minds any apprehension that may have been excited of the Court interfering with your province, I have to say, that it is as far from the intention of any one of us to encroach on your province, as it can have been from the intention of any of the Counsel who have addressed you. You are to judge from the evidence applied to the case, according to the law ofthe case, as laid down by the best authorities. Impartiality is your duty, and it is a duty which I am confident you will exercise. — If you think the evidence affords proof of the crime charged, you will find the Piisouer guilty ; if, on the other hand, you find the evidence insufficient, you will acquit the Prisoner; and if that should be the result, none can rejoice more than I, assured as I am that you will judge according to the evidence. The first count in the indictment charges the prisont-r with levying war against the King. It is very important for you to understand what is meant by levying war; the expression is clear, yet it applies to divers meanings. I will now state to you the law, as clearly established, in reference to the case before you. The words of the Statute 25 Edward 111. are, "If a man levy war against our ___ord tbe King in his realm." The explanation of this law, whkh I have here (Foster's) is short and clear : I therefore read it to you, rather than give an explanation in any words of my own: "If there be an insurrection, a large lisiug of the pei»ole, in order by force aiitl violence to accomplish or revenge, not any private object or private quarrel of their own, but mn object of a general nature, that is a levying war against the King." From my experience of the administration of justice, from the decisions of Courts, and from the authority of Sir Matthew I^ale , ijuibre Foster, and Lord Coke, I can affirm that this is a clear mi correct exp-.ar.a.lon of .• tc-rrr-s ?? the Statute. Private tumults are not a levying of war. If the object be only a private one, whatever may be its character otherwise, it is not a levying of war. To destroy a private inclosure is not levying war against the King. To destroy all inclosures is a levying of war. If the object be to pull down a chapel, or an offensive building, it is not a levying of war; if it be to destroy all chapels, or all offensive buildings, it is a levying of war. There must then be an insurrection or large rising; force aud violence must be used; it must be for a general object. That there was an insurrection is clear; it is also clrar that force and violence were used. It is your province to say whether the object was general or private; whether the insurrection was only the effect of private quarrels, of wild, violent, and riotous tumult; or whether the object was to alter the measures of Government, and to destroy the laws of the ceuntry. If I have made myself intelligible to you, you can have no difficulty in understanding the nature of your duty. The ether couuts of the indictment are founded upon the thirty-sixth of the King. The question for you to determine, is, whether any of the three charges is proved by the evidence which I now detail to you. The evidence is all on oue side, and most of the witnesses were not even cross-examined, yet attempts Mere mad--, very properly, in the speeches of the Counsel, to fix im- putations on the credit of the evidence. It is for you to judge whether such attempts were successful. The Learned Judge then read the evidence very fully. He remarked that the atrocious murder which took place was not treason; but it was for them to say what was the object of such atrocious conduct. He at last concluded a charge of two hours thus:— This, gentlemen, is the evidence. That there was an insurrection is clear; that there was a large rising, and that more were to join in Nottingham Forest is quite clear. It is equally clear thai the persons assembled thus were armed. There was then force and violence. Was this violent and forcible rising calculated to accomplish any private object, or to revenge any private quarrel; or was it calculated and intended to alter the government and to bring about a revolution? The low situation in life of the persons engaged in this insurrection is no excuse. A crime is uot less a crime because the criminal is poor, lf there could be no prospect of success, that is no excuse, because the crime consists in the intention and not in the adequacy of the means. The question for you is, was the rising calculated to alter the government, to overturn the laws, and to cause a revolution? You have the evidence before you, and it says that it was declared from time to time that there could be no good without an over- turn of the Government, tkat the Parliament must he pulled down, and similar expressions. If you believe this evidence, you are bound by the oath you have taken to find the prisoner guilty. If, on the other hand, you can lay your hands on your hearts, and believe, and are satisfied, that the object was private or personal, then you will not find him guilty. I am persuaded you will give every attention, and exercise the most perfect in. tegrity. All consequences that may result you are to leave entirely out of view, and lo regard only strict justice, and a just verdict according to the law, in the face of God and your country. The Jury retired, and in 20 minutes returned with a verdict, finding Jeremiah Brandreth Guilty of High Treason, and that he had no funds or tenement s y goods or chattels, when the crime was committed. The Court was excessively crowded, and the most profound silence prevailed while the verdict was given in and recorded. The Prisoner seemed quite unmoved, and even indifferent. The Chief Baro*-* asked the Attorney-General whether he could say it was probable that any other trial could begone ihrough to-day, as otherwise it would be a hardship for the Jury to be confined during the Sunday. The Attorney-General conceived that it was impossible to finish any other trial this day, and proposed, with Mr. Cross's consent, to adjourn till Monday. Mr. Cross assented. All the Jurors were ordered to continue in at- tendance. Adjourned at half-past ten to eight on Monday morning. William Turner is the next person that will be tried. When the Court adjourned, the Prisoner was left in the custody of Mr. Katon and a few javelin men. The Hall had been cleared, but two or tiiree persons found their way to the Bar, where the Prisoner was seated, handcuffed to Mr. Eaton. He appeared to have been washed this day, for the first time since the commencement of the proceedings, and, in consequence, the expression of his countenance was less ferocious than it had been till now. Having seated himself on the bench behind the bar, he seemed to be for some moments absorbed in the contemplation of his awful destiny. A more than usual paleness invaded his cheek, a faint perspiration was observed to overspread it, and all the horrors ofhis situation appeared to burst on his imagination. Reviving to a consciousness of the presence ofthe few individuals who surrounded him, he madean effort to resume his wonted composure, and answered one or two unimportant questions put to him with a smile, which might well be called, in the language of Milton, "a ghastly smile" He was treated with great humanity and tenderness by those about him. As they knew h.m to be much in the habit of smoking, he was asked, "if he would like a pipe?" He replied in the affirmative, and a small part of a tobacco pipe, not more than three inches in length, was brought, to h.m, which he had used before. One of the men who guarded him, observed to the person who brougiit it, "that he might have accommodated him with a clean one." Brandreth, however, made no objection to it ; he received it with an awkward bow of gratitude, placed it in his mouth, and immediately began to smoke in the Court. Several female servants connected with the offices ahout the Hall were attracted by curiosity to gaze on the convict. His deplorable situation moved their pity, and they asked him v If he would like a tumbler of negus r " Brandreth seemed scarcely to hear, or to understand the question to be addressed to him. Those about him, however, replied, "Yes, bring it." They left the Hall to do so, aad the caravan which . •»eing not yet ready for his reception, ,„«,- * ' lay ocrurre ' to allow them time to retem ** """ Brandreth having he.i, supp',;^ wj| *. smoked f.»r some i»ittute_, his P>e s rih,^* a half suppressed tear and fi XP( ] | on that IT ** which he had just heard t!,e awful word n . ?? •*■ which doomed h-to 3! , i gnrtmilliou ;^N -.entiemnn present .tiquired " if tl.*_ _. * * » uib pi Honor X, i any statement or declaration to mate nW l could wish to I* laid before tha pablic"* ?? same time offering to I>e the medium of com! eating any thing of the kind , 0 the London papers. He did not seem at first fo trnrn^ the purport of the question, but cm its bei,,. peated, he desired the person from whom it cam apply to Mr. Bond the Attorney. A ».j statement lH he might have to make he should make through ifc gentleman, but he added, » I do not inteod to ?? any." The gI«S9 of negus was now brought. ?? bowed when it was given, said "Thank ye" J began to drink it. At the same time a lame D L, , 1 •_L _. 1 , 5 v"P" ?? sandwrehes was handed to lum, for which he 3e very grateful. He endeavoured to nat them in L s h but the liberality which supplied Mm. coald 'not fe compressed within such narrow limits, tmd he » M »L vised to carry them in his hand. Upon thi, he ??

He hastily lfrailk mamedof las negus, and, carry i.igi he sandwiches*;,' him, was conveyed out of the Hall by th P bark »*. He walked with a firm step, a „d with an air of -ioJj resignation, escorted by a few javelin men to the 1 ravan which he ascended, being still handcuffed to Mr. l_.aton r and t» as-carried back to the n.ison at eleven o'clock, amidst a greater crowd than had accompanied him on any previous occasion. Therein, no cheering as, he passed, nor was there any expression of an opposite nature; but the verdict of the Jury seemed to have made him an object of neater public interest than he had >etv.a. any time anterior to the trial, or during Usprogress.
