TO DO

WOOLEN TRADE.

Extract of the Report of the Committee to whom the Petition of the several Persons concerned in the Woollen Trade and Manufactories within the Counties of Somerset, Wilts, and Gloucester, was referred.

 Mr. Enwerto Clothier, at Ufey in Gloucestershire, upwards of 15 yeah, being examined, said, that if the statute of the .sth eh. iv. was carried into offal, every great part of the trade of the county of Gloucester must be lost, as a very great proportion oithe weavers ftrpreamr employed had not been apprenticed; that, in his own manufactory, at one establishment, he employs about seventy-five Wavers, out of Which five ugly have . been apprenticed according to the above . statute ; that at the other he employs about eighty-three, out of which sixteen have been apprenticed ; the greatest proporticiii are men, some are women. With rea'pe6t to the cloth Workers, he has not' one' amongst the whole who has been apprenticed seven years ; he infers, that 'if none but legal weavers were employed, he should lose the major part of his trade--.- That notwithstanding the introduction of spring (which of la.:e years have very much increased the number of looms) three is not at this time any surplus of competent and food weavers existing—So . necessary is it that the number. of weavers should nor be decreased, the coarse woollen trade has already been, in a great ...degree, lost to the county of Gloucester, principally for .want of weavers to carry on that branch of manufacture: He conceives that a aery short period of time (within a year) is necessary to acquire a proficiency in the art of weaving —That, by the change in the nature of the woollen manufactory, in consequence of machinery, it has been and is necessary to form manufacturing establishments in villages, where the advantages of water and fall. are materially considered, therefore, in such situations apprenticed weavers arc not to be met with—That, in consequence of the great increase in the demand for woollen cloths of late years, a great number of people, pf every description, have embarked in the trade as clothiers, who have not been apprenticed, and therefore would; by the enforcement of the said statute, be thrown out of business ; that he himself has never been so op , . .premiced, neither does he know any one who has ; and he conceives it necessary for the well-being of the woollen trade, that the manufacturer should, as occasion required, either from the opening of new markets, or increased demand in old ones, have it• in his power to employ such work-people in every branch as may be requisite—That if clothiers are restrided from the employment of work-people who have not been apprenticed, an extension of their trade would he impossible on any occasion of extraordinary demand—That he belieies it to be con-, miry to the fact, that the number of regular wea. v”rs, able and willing to work at the ancient and einal prices s who are out of employ, is immense, oe that their number ale daily increasing p: he , speaks only of the county of Gloucester—That, from his own experience, the employment of persons, not regularly apprenticed to the business 'of weaving, does not tend to destroy the good quality of the manufacture ; that he has never known, or heard till lately', of any prosecutions for enforcing the above statute—That the number of apprentices has greatly diminished of late years, which he conceives to be the consequence of the present increase of the woollen trade That, out of the number of persons employed in both his establishments, he can= not exactly say what proportion are men to the women (as they work at their own houses), but a much greater proportion ate men. That by the introduction of the spring -shuttle, more cloth has been made, which could not otherwise have taken place) from the want of weavers, as the operation of weaving is now performed by one person, instead of twooo the great saving of the labour; it being measure of the weavers own adoption, they are paid the same per piece as before the intmdation of the spring shuttles—That he gives no preference to apprenticed weavers, but the very reverse, as they in general are old men—That, as the trade is now carried on, a great many persons are employed as work-people, for their own benefit, at an earlier age than they could have been under the operation of the existing statute, and that mere women are now employed in weaving than formerly, in common with the increase of men—That it has not been the practice in Gloucestershire for persons to be bound apprentices in villages (to which it is necessary to resort on account of water and fall) nor does he think legal* weavers could have been found to be transferred front one part of the county to the other, sufficient to take the apprentices ; that lie does not think any apprentices would be bound on the conditions to the woollen trade generally, so as to be equally transferred from one branch of the trade to the other, with those who are now employed as workmen—That the repeal of the statute requiring weavers to serve apprenticeships, would certainly not prove ruinous to the legal weavers or their families—That many weaver, receive work from different masters, and have many warps by them at the same time belonging to those different masters, by which means the return of the work is very much delayed, and therefore the number of weavers is not in proportion.to the quantity of cloth required to be made. Being asked, Whether any prosecutions had , ham commenced, or threatened, under the aforesaid statute? he stated, that there was a prosecution at the last summer assizes for Gloucestershire, but under what statute he did not know, but he understood that it was compromised by withdrawing a juror-1 le does not know that the defendant did undertake that in future he would employ none but legal weavers, or upon what terms, but he knows that a great many notices have been given of prosecutions against master weavers since, and that friendly sccieues or clubs have been formed with a view to commence prosecutions against those who use or exercise the trade of a woollen cloth weaver. illegally; in confi-s !nation of which, the witness produced a book, intituled " and Articles of a Friendly Society, or Club, called the Woollen Cloth Weavers' Society, • begun the kb day of September, ;" and also, PIR.IDINT, His Duke of SOMERSET, in the Chair. sotes-PREill DENTS.

Mr.*li.eteet SREPPARD, clothier, at Frome, in Somersetshire, about 14 years, being examined: said, 'fleet. in all e matkeee, both home and foreign, the prifereece gi'l3en to Gloucestershire cloths was so very evident, that he found it neeesetry to send the e wholeof his broad cloths near ninety," ilex weekly to lee dressesay tho gigs; since the intrOclunipn of the gig, - hi stock is lessened, and the cloths are wonderfully improved—that the necessity warso_great, that last year and the presentlhe been obliged. to accept orders to a very large amount, deevered an tinfinished.state, after being milled, 'so that the merchant who had received them, had them dreseed by the.gig after his own manner l-thet be (the witness) tried every thing in his power to finish them himself, but found it impossible; and rather than give up the orders, acceded to the terms—that the introduCtion of the gig mill will be highly beneficial, and that he fias engaged to his workmen that he will employ them et 14s. pergweek 'as long ,as they are able to work.—And being asked, Whether he kiiew of any combinations of any workmen, in consequence of any attempt to introtlece the gig-Mill into his ileigilbOuthoodl He said, that meetings of shearmen are privately held to receive subscriptions so as to provide for those out of employ, and they produce a ticket so to eseieie them to their weekly Bowsera,.SOlicitor at Bath, being examinedesaid, that he does 'not know-of any prosecutioni being commenced against the clothiers tor using the gig-mill, but has beer ipformed by Mr. Wilmeepsolicitor for the shearmen in Wiltshire, that he has received instruCtions to commence anions against such manufanueeis who persevere in using the gig-mill. Statute 2. and 3. Philip and Mary, c. 11. Sec. 2. and 3. read. Eeq. - fa. Member), - hall-street, merchant, beinfeeamined, said, that the nature ofhis business is chiefly in the sale of Spanish wool and superfine cloth. And being_ asked, , whether he. had any information to give respening the petition of the 'clothiers for the repeal or alteration of divers statutes ? he said, That he conceived it ,:would be materiall ; detrimental that any law should be repealed which tend to .proteet labourers fltditferent branches of the manufanory. •That it appeared to him that extreme caution will'be necessary in repealing certain reserinive alas, of which the menufanurers justly complain, that others which tend to prated the labourers be not blended in -that repeal. That at one period of the war, he believes between 1797 and 179 p, from the scarcity of Spanish wool, the labourers Could not be employed in the manufacture of superfine cloth, and at that period a great number of the manfanurers enrolled themselves in the Militia, and entered in the army.— Subsequent to that period, the large importation of Spanish wool, and considerable orders tOr cloth, called for the increased introdudion of. machinery ; and that he conceives, at the present period, those men who have returned to the clothing towns, and are capable of resuming their employment, should have that given them before any further additions are made to machinery ; that those men should, he conceives, in every degree, be ;frowned at this period, when offers are made to induce menufaCturers to quit the country, in order to establish the manufacture in Spain, with all the advantagesto be derived from machinery. That it is a tth within his own knowledge, that a manufedurer who is competent to introduce and establish the manufaetory, on the footing iu which it is conduCted in this country, may have 1000 guineas per Annum secured to him for a certain number of years, or a portion of the advantages to be derived flom the manufaCtory, at his option. That as a case in point with the Court of Spain, and 'to shew the good faith they have preserved, under similar circumstances, with other Maanfanurers, some years since, about the year 1780, a tanner was induced to go to Spain, and was offered by f sat g« vernment every facility to establish his business on a huge scale; he stated, that a large capital would be necessary, Which was furnished him, the witne..s believes, to the amount of 60,0001. ; that a proper !situation would be necessary to establish the business, and he was desired to travel the country, and to fit on any situation most likely to answer the purpose ; that he was in consequence pnt in possession of a convent, at a short distance from Seville; the friars of the Order of St. Jago were removed to a different situation, to make room for tke labourers he thought necessary to bring from England ; that nearly 40 English families did in consequence settle there, proteded in their religious principles, and allowed every requisite for their comfort and convenience ; and that this establishment has so far succeeded, that the export of tanned leather, which at that time was vary considerable, is : now reduced to a very inconsiderable quantity.—To, shew how much interested Spain is iu the establishment of the enanufaCture of woollen cloth on toe principle in which it is conduCted by machinery, it must be observed, that the raw material, namely, Spanish wool, can be ; 

 procured at one-third less than here; and that oil and soap, two other material articles in the manufacture, may be obtained at very little more than half the cost in this country; and consequently, if our labourers, from want of employment, are driven seek: that in cOsi2- try, which they are alepriveJ 4.f here, we 10w . 194 foreign trade for this articla of • , trreine cloth, which can be rendered much ,totAcaper i n Sp A in—thar without the introduftion of taeolsiatry into Spain, se conceives it intpositica:•ble Zr or them to rival this , eotrntry in the marufactare of Cluth--that if saachincry was est.gilished . Any other 4a)untry, this °entry. could r.nt support a c.astpatition in the foreign market-!-that he has tram the report of cnanufaeturers themselves, are out of employment in couseinence air -use of machinery, but does not know it as a rut—that he has never publicly pledged himself to ' talk:lvo= t, prevent the further tau :endue!ion oisractincry.' He never hail any communi.' arum with the 'labourers in' any branch of the ma. tfatiere—that be cat state particularly as to hose nstrinions of *lira the marntiaelurers justly but they are those which preclude the exportation of unshorn cloth, and as to the measuring and folding of cloth, and others.

HOUSE of COMMONS. FRIDAY, July 1

On the question for the third reading the Woollen Clothiers' Bill,

*Mr. Brooke* rose to oppose it, and moved, amendment, that it be read on that day three months.

*Mr. Bragge* said, the Bill went to repeal the statute of Edw. VI. which had been enacted to prevent the use of certain machine, called a gig-mill, and which machine no longer existed. Prosecutions, however, had been lately carried on against persons for using machines called that name, and it was necessary stop them.

*The Chancellor of the Exchequer* said, he subscribed to What was just stated his Right Hon. Friend, and observed, that the House should not be influenced in its decision by any consideration those outrages which had been committed in some of the Western counties.

The Bill was then read a third time, and passed. The several other orders were then disposed of, and the House adjourned.
