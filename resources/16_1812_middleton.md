TO DO

DISTURBANCES IN THE COUNTRY.

Letters have been received from Manchester, stating hie renewal of the outrages in that town and neighbourhood. A letter, dated Manchester, eight o’clock, Monday night, says, The potatoe warehouses have been broken open by the populace, and the owners compelled to sell very reduced prices.—The streets are much crowded, but no large parties are suffered to collect. An express is just arrived from Middleton, with information, that Mr. Burton’s mill has been attacked, but was defended by himself, with a few confidential servants, who fired upon the mob repeatedly, and five of them have been either killed or wounded. A gentleman since arrived, who states, that he saw two of them dead. It is also reported that another mill the neighbourhood, and one at Holton, have been attacked. We are very short of military, and, with their present hard duty, those here will worn out with fatigue.

Nine P.M.—The drums are heating to arms; the mob becomes more formidable than ever, but outrages have been committed, as the military have dispersed the populace during the whole of the day.

Another letter says—"The rioters are this day more turbulent than ever. A large mob having assembled New-cross, and also at Not-mill, they entered the shops and houses, taking meal, flour, and potatoes, with every other article that fell in their way. There is also a large mob assembled at Middleton, and in every other direction. The town is now all in confusion, not knowing where it will end. They are threatening destruction to the whole town."

We are sorry to bear that on Monday evening last, a numerous meeting of people took place at Romford, and perambulated the streets for several hours, and during the evening did considerable damage in the neighbourhood; among other mischievous acts, they wantonly set fire haystack.

A private letter from Nottingham states, that an express arrived there on Sunday night, with orders for two troops the 15th Light Dragoons to march immediately for Sheffield, a distance of thirty-seven miles, with only baiting on the road; and they set off accordingly with their baggage. Orders were received at the same time for the South Devon to march for the same destination in two divisions; and the letter adds, the General proceeded to Derby Sunday evening. From this intelligence, would appear that a renewal of, the disturbances at Sheffield was apprehended.

ANOTHER ACCOUNT.

"*Manchester, April 21.* —I have the painful task inform you, that disturbances were renewed yesterday here, owing to a number of persons, chiefly women, seizing a quantity of meal from a cart, and forcibly carrying it away. About 40 or 50 of the cavalry were called in, when the Riot Act was read, and the people were dispersed without further injury. Several of the women were committed. The shops in that part of the town (Ancoats) were closed the greater part the day. It had a truly awful appearance.

But the most melancholy circumstance has taken place at Middleton, about five miles from hence; a large body of men, women, and boys, attacked the weaving factory, in the evening of yesterday, belonging to Messrs. Burtons, in consequence of these gentlemen weaving by machinery. The assailants attacked the factory with a volley of stones; when at length, a guard having been placed therein, musketry was fired with ball, and, sorry I am to say, five men were killed, and 16 or 18 wounded. The consequence was, that the insurgents assembled in vast bodies this day, armed with guns, scythes, and other offensive weapons. A party of the military, horse and foot, were sent from hence with all possible dispatch. The cavalry are just returned, after dispersing those misguided people, killing three, and wounding several others. Lamentable to add, the mob have wreaked their vengeance on Mr. E. Barton’s house and furniture, which are burnt to the ground. These are awful events!"
