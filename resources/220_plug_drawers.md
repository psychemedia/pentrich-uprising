Lyrics
1
Come, all you croppers stout and bold,
Let your faith grow stronger still,
For the cropper lads in the county of York
Have brocken the shears at Foster’s Mill.

2
Around and around we all will stand
And sternly swear we will,
We’ll break the shears and the windows too
And we’ll all set fire to tazzlin’ mill.

3
The wind it blew and the sparks they flew,
Which alarmed the town full soon,
And out of bed poor folk did leave,
And they run bi the light o’ the moon.

4
Around and around they all did stand
And solemnly did swear,
Neither bucket nor kit nor any such thing
Should be of any assistance there.

5
All dark and dreary is the day
When men ’ave to feight for their bread;
Some judgment sure will clear the way
And the coach of triumph shall be led.

The Plug Riots of August 1842 were a protest about working conditions, food prices and lack of reform. The first attack in Cleckheaton targeted Anderton’s factory at Providence Place. A mob attempted to draw the plug from the boiler,[to cut off the steam and shut down the mill], but they were beaten away. They met little resistance at Roundhill Mill, Gomersal. Five to six thousand men and women then assailed St. Peg Mill. Two of the three boiler plugs were drawn before special constables, a troop of lancers and a detachment of the Yorkshire Hussars arrived. Fighting broke out on a grand scale. The throng was dispersed without loss of life.

[Preceding page and column describes gathering at Halifax of 12-15,000 people]

HUDDERSFIELD. Monday.—Soon after five o'clock this morning, a meeting of working people, not the regular turn-outs, but principally comprising women and children, was held at Back Green. Their number, probably, would be about four hundred. Shortly after they had mustered, Mr. William Brook, the magistrate, accompanied by a number of special constables, proceeded to the spot, and advised them to go home; they remained some time longer, but eventually dispersed between six and seven peaceably.

But the town was not destined to remain quiet all the day. The workers of mischief were marching from Lancashire, and ere night set in the town was one alarming scene of riot and confusion. The forenoon passed off without any particular disturbance taking place; yet still the inhabitants were in hourly expectation of being surrounded by the mob from the outskirts. The only mills which ventured to resume work were those of Messrs. Starkey Brothers, Mr. George Crossland, Messrs. Brook, and Messrs. Swaine and Webb. These mills, however, were forced to succumb to the turn-outs before five o'clock in the afternoon.

The disturbances commenced shortly after four o'clock, on the arrival of a mob, whose number some have ventured to estimate at 20,000, but we should imagine this would be far above the mark. These men came down the Meltham and Holme valleys, in distinct parties, out of Lancashire, and they formed a grand coalition at Armitage-bridge. On their way to Huddersfield they attacked and stopped the mills of Messrs. Brook Brothers, Meltham-mills ; Messrs. Stables, of Crossland-mills ; Messrs. Wrigley's, of Netherton ; Messrs. Beaumont and Stooks (commonly called Lord's-mill), at Honley; Messrs. D. Shaw, Son, and Co., Henley; Messrs. Beaumont, Vickerman, and Co., Steps-mill. They then proceeded to the Hall Ings colliery; to John Brook and Son's, at Armitage-bridge; and the last mill which they forced on the road was that of Mr. I. T. C. Wrigley. At all these places the men had all their own way, their numbers defying opposition.

They arrived in Huddersfield about half-past four o'clock, and their formidable appearance, being armed with thick sticks and bludgeons, which they continually brandished about, and the bold front which they assumed, showed that they had come prepared for the worst. The first move they made on entering the town was direct to the mill of Messrs. Henry Brook and Sons, which they forcibly entered, and knocked the plug out of the boiler. This was about twenty minutes to five o'clock. All the shops were closed, and every where alarm took hold of the most stout-hearted. The magistrates, the soldiers, and the special constables then prepared to resist the further progress of the assailants by scouring the streets; and the first rencontre which the soldiers had with the mob was at Messrs. Brook's mill, where they were charged by the Lancers. One man was here wounded by a lance of one of the soldiers, and another rioter was taken prisoner to the George Inn. To prevent further mischief and bloodshed, Mr. Brook, at this stage of the riot, addressed the men in a friendly manner, and offered them half an hour in which to disperse, which they promised to do. In the mean time the Riot Act had been read by Mr. Wm. Armitage, the magistrate, opposite Mr. Brook's factory, and it was subsequently read a second time near the George Inn.

After leaving Mr. Brook's mill, the soldiers and all the special constables then entered into the George Inn yard. The mob, instead of dispersing, went to the prison (or, as it is called, the towzer), forced the doors, and demanded the release of the prisoner. On being told he was not in confinement there, they were not satisfied without being shown through every cell, and the keeper was obliged to comply with the demand.

The mob then proceeded to the George Inn, and made a desperate attempt to force their way in to rescue the prisoner, but they were as determinedly repulsed by the special constables, who came out of the yard, and then there was a prolonged and violent conflict between the two antagonist powers, in the midst of which the military made their appearance and formed into square. After the magistrates had repeatedly entreated the people to separate, and not finding them willing to do so, the soldiers were ordered to charge. The magistrates then rode up and down the streets, urging the people to get out of the way, as the soldiers were about to fire. Mr. Joseph Starkey was particularly active at this crisis. Tho people then dispersed, expecting every moment the firing of the soldiers. No hostile movement, however, then took place, the soldiers remaining in one position in front of the George Inn, for at least twenty minutes.

During the cessation the people gradually surrounded the troops, and several parleys took place between the magistrates and the people, until at length the latter become so audacious in their behaviour, that no alternative was left but to order the military to charge, whereupon one of the most terrific scenes we ever beheld took place; and it was during this alarming crisis that our reporter entered the town in the omnibus from the Cooper-bridge station, at about a quarter past six. The omnibus drove to the Swan Inn, in Market-street, but it had no sooner reached its destination than it was surrounded by three or four soldiers on horseback, and before the unoffending but unlucky travellers could get out of the way, naked swords were flying about their heads in all directions, and our reporter was within a hair's breadth of receiving a slash on the head. This unwelcome reception, however, was avoided by making a precipitate retreat, and some of his companions were likewise fortunate; but one man who had mounted the coach for the purpose of getting his luggage, on being asked by one of the soldiers what he was doing there, replied, "Go to h———." One of the soldiers surrounding the omnibus, who appeared to act in a much more furious manner than was warranted by the circumstances, then struck one of the passengers a most severe blow with his sword on the back of the neck, which had nearly thrown him to the ground. Another of the passengers received a blow in descending from the coach. This sudden attack on the passengers cannot too strongly be condemned. The soldiers no doubt had orders to clear the streets; but in doing their duty it becomes them to exercise discretion in the use of their weapons, and not to strike at parties who could not possibly have taken part in previous disturbances. It was only by the interference of three special constables that the reporters obtained protection, and were conducted in safety to the George Inn.

The scene in the streets at this period was fearful. Every shop and house was closed. The Lancers, backed by the special constables, struck terror into the hearts of the mob, who fled before them in the greatest confusion, and by seven o'clock not a straggler was to be seen.

The special constables were particularly active in securing the ringleaders, and the number taken into custody at this period and during the afternoon amounted to 18, including one woman, all of whom were chained and lodged in the George Inn, the prison being considered unsafe.

In the skirmishing which took place a great number of persons were more or less wounded, and one of the soldiers boasted that he had felled seven in about two minutes. It was reported that one of the wounded was a young man in the employ of Mr. Schwann; and two others were fatally injured.

Up to a late hour the authorities were employed in keeping the streets clear.

RIOTING IN YORKSHIRE. (From a Fourth Edition of the Leeds Mercury.). Our reporter, on his return to Leeds this evening, has received particular and positive information the the mill-hands have been turned out at Huddersfield. This information was given to him in the train by a manufacturer who entered the carriage at Cooperbridge, the Huddersfield station, and who declared that he had himself seen the movements of the mob, and that his own mill had been stopped. A railway guard, who arrived here at half-past four, brought the information that the turn•outs had begun their operations at Huddersfield; but he was told that the party who produced the turn out there went from Leeds We are bound to say, however, that we have not heard these important particulars confirmed from any other quarter, and we cannot help thinking that conirmation would have reached Leeds if such events had really occurred at a town so near as Huddersfield. We only, therefore, give the following statement just as our reporter received it, and without vouching for its truth. He was informed as follows : "A body of the Todmorden turn-outs (about 700 in number) reacted Huddersfield this afternoon at about two o'clock, and having brought everything to a stand between that place and Todmorden, they at once began to call out the workpeople from the factories. In a great majority of the cases they met with no opposition, the workpeople manifesting every disposition to join the mob. Where resistance was offered they immediately set about drawing out the boilerplugs, defying all opposition; and before half-past four o'clock there was not a factory at work either in Huddersfield or the surrounding districts. No attempts to injure either property or person were manifested. Up to six o'clock the combined turn-outs were peaceably perambulating the streets in one great procession." - - Our reporter resumes the particulars he has gained, as follows:—" The rioters having stopped all the mills at Mytholmroyd, some of them retired to Cragg Valley, but others went off in a detachment to Hud dersfield. Huddersfield, it is understood, is the last place that it is intended to visit to-day. But for Monday morning, at seven o'clock, the instructions are, that those who ard at Huddersfield, and the party at Cragg Valley, shall each make a descent upon other parts of Yorkshire." (From a Fifth Edition of the Leeds Mercury) Saturday, 11 o'clock, p.m.— We learn by gentlemen who have just reached Leeds from Huddersfield, a full confirmation of the facts stated in our fourth edition as to the turn-out of all the mill-hands in that town. The rioters who invaded this town came from Oldham, not, as had been stated, from Todmorden. They were about 5,000 or 6,000, with many women. They arrived at three o'clock p.m., and went early to the mill of Messrs. Starkey Brothers, who, being magistrates, blockaded the gates, and declared that they would read the Riot Act. The turn-outs disregarded these threats, broke open the gates, entered the mill, and turned out every hand. The rioters then proceeded to Mr. Kay's mill, and turned out all the hands. At the mill of Mr. William Brook, the magistrate, in North-street, that gentleman made some opposition, but it was altogether fruitless; the mob broke into the mill, burst in the plug of the steam-engine boilers, and turned out all the workmen. In fact, the hands were expelled from every mill in the town in the curse of the afternoon. A meeting was held, but we do not know the resolutions come to. After the mills had been stopped, the invaders marched through the town, many of them begging, ,but not committing any acts of plunder. _ The bulk of the inv a ders from the cotton districts are thought to have returned home into Lancashire; but it was said that many would attend the meeting of the colliers at Wakefield on Monday next. In Leeds the authorities are quite on the alert. Arrangements are making to swear in 500 special constables on Monday morning. The town is also provided with a good military force, the 17th lancers (Prince George of Cambridge's regiment), and one or two troops of artillery being at our barracks. We learn from a gentleman who has been in many of the mills in this neighbourhood to-day, that the best disposition is manifested by the workmen who will resist any attempt to seduce or intimidate them. A squadron of the 11th hussars have received orders from Colonel Wemyss, at Manchester, to march from York to Rochdale; they will arrive in Leeds to-morrow.
