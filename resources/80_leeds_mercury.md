RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM

For some time past the Wholesale Hosiers, who have Stocking-weaving Establishments in the county of Nottingham, have been obliged to curtail their hands; this produced considerable discontent among the workmen. Their riotous spirit was, however, increased by the trade having brought into use a certain wide frame for the manufacture of stockings and gaiters, which, was a considerable saving in manual labour, leading still further to the decrease of the hands employed. On Sunday se'nnight last this being generally known, a number of weavers assembled at different places in the vicinity of Nottingham, and commenced their career of outrage, by forcibly entering the houses of such persons as used particular frames.

A letter dated Nottingham, the 14th inst. communicates, that the late hands in particular were in a very distressed situation, and under the necessity of applying for parochial relief. A master weaver, at Buttlwell, having been threatened by the rioters, and hearing they intended to attack his property, on the Monday, armed all his men to defend his frames, and barricaded his house. Being in his garrison, he waited the attack of the enemy, who demanded admittance, or a surrender of the frames. The master would agree to neither, and was immediately fired upon ;- several shots were then exchanged, and one of the rioters was shot dead; he was a weaver from Arnold, and at the time he paid the forfeit of his life he was in the act of *tearing* down the window-shutters to obtain entrance by force. The rest of the mob retired with the slain body, but soon returned with redoubled strength. They broke open the door, and would have put the whole family to death had they not escaped by a back door. They then proceeded to gut the house, and consumed every thing that would burn.

On Tuesday, the outrages of the mob were continued; they attacked a carrier, who was bringing five wide frames from Sutton, belonging to Maltby and Brewett, that had been in use a length of time at Basford. The iron work they took to pieces, and with the wood work they made a fire in the street.

Other letters state, that the frames which first excited the resentment of the mob belonged to Messrs. Watson and Nelson, and produced 24 dozen gaiters in one week, at 4s. per dozen working, which was considered an extraordinary quantity.

In the afternoon of Tuesday, the rioters proceeded towards Sutton to continue their outrages there; and that evening they destroyed the frames of the principal weavers.

On the Wednesday morning, the rioters assembled in open day, and again repaired to Sutton, where they destroyed in all fifty-three frames and a corn-mill.— Having gained strength, and meeting with no effectual opposition for want of military aid, they grew bolder, and changed the frame-breaking employment into more violent proceedings, and now swore vengeance against wide-frames, millers, corn-dealers, &c.

On Thursday similar proceedings were continued, and all remonstrances from the Magistrates having failed to restrain the rioters within bounds, it was considered high time to think of decisive measures; many of the most active of the peace breakers were already in custody, but this seemed to have no weight with those at large. The military were called out, but when in full muster they did not exceed 30 men, who were dismounted dragoons, and they being unequal to any thing, the Sheriff the same day issued orders for calling out the *posse comitatis*, and the First and Second Regiments of Local Militia, an a further aid was required of Government by a special messenger sent to town for that purpose, who reached the Office of the Home Department about three on Friday morning.

All Thursday was employed in assembling together the Militia, in conformity to the orders of the Sheriff; during this time the mob were enabled to carry on their depredations in distinct quarters, nor could they with policy be molested, as it was very much apprehended that if the town was left for a moment unprotected they would make a sudden attempt to get possession of the depot of arms, for it appeared to many that their proceedings had a tendency to that end.

On Friday morning intelligence was received that several frames of an ordinary size had been destroyed at Kimberley, because they were worked by women.

Many persons concerned in these proceedings have been taken into custody, four of whom have been fully committed.

The High Sheriff, with the advice of the County Magistrates, has called in the Home Pierrepoint, and Bunny troops of Yeomanry Cavalry, whose services, with a detachment of the 4th Dragoons from the barracks, have been of the greatest utility. As an additional security, the First Regiment of Local Militia are assembling, and the Newark Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry are in readiness to act. The Magistrates are every where at their posts. Some hundreds of special Constables have been sworn in.

On Thursday the body of *John Westley* a native of Leicester, the man who was shot in Sunday night at Bulwell, was removed to Arnold for interment, where he has resided for about twelve years; and where he has left two orphans, one five and the other three years of age, to bewail his untimely end: their mother having been dead some time. In the afternoon the funeral took place, and the scene was truly awful. The High Sheriff, the Under Sheriff, and about half a dozen Magistrates were on the spot, attended by a *posse* of Constables, and about thirty mounted Dragoons, who all proceeded with the funeral to the church-yard; but before the body was removed the Riot Act was read in several parts of the town. From seven hundred to a thousand persons attended on the occasion: the corpse was preceded by a number of the deceased's former club mates, bearing black wands, decked with knots of crape,—Sorrow seemed to have seated itself upon every brow, and a solemn silence, still as death, was only interrupted by the trampling of the multitude, the bell's heavy knoll, and a band of music playing a solemn dirge, accompanied at distant intervals by the beating of a bass drum !! About the time that the corpse was lowering into the grave, the High Sheriff proclaimed that an hour had elapsed since the reading of the Riot Act, and informed the multitude, that those who did not instantly disperse, should be taken into custody as rioters; and two were actually seized who did not immediately obey, but we believe, were shortly set at liberty; and the whole concourse quietly disbursed. Many more we understand were wounded in the various conflicts, and reports have stated several others to have lost their lives, but which reports, we hope are unfounded.

The most recent accounts from Nottingham left that town and neighbourhood free from tumult, in consequence of the strong military force assembled in that quarter. The workmen still, however, urge their complaints and what they call their rights. At a late meeting, held at the sign of the Sir Isaac Newton, the frame-work knitters came to several resolutions: among others, that their earnings as frame-knitters were inferior to those of any other class of mechanics: that the present grievances were as much to be attributed to the *irresolute* conduct in themselves, in not standing forward for the rights of the trade, as to an imposing principle on the part of their employers; and that they would resist impositions in future. On the 18th inst. another meeting was to take place, but we have not learnt the result.

Nottingham, Dec. 12- The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has no parallel in history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. Day after day have the Magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil powers, and called in additional aid of the military; but hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail; a mysterious organization has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. — The rioters appear suddenly, in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of who, being whomsoever he may, is stiled *General Ludd*, and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of the Monarch. Indeed it is well understood, that disobedience to his commands is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organized band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already being inflicted, by the burning of haystacks, &c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and so few of the depredators apprehended.

The following article, on the same subject, is from the *Statesman* Newspaper, and is of so alarming a complexion as to induce a hope that there is some degree of exaggeration:—

*December 15*— There are 20,000 stocking-makers out of employment. Six regiments of soldiers from different parts of the country have been sent into this town; and 300 new constables have been sworn in to keep the peace. But all this is of no avail as the practice of setting fire to corn and hay stacks, and breaking open houses still continues. Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken, which cost £140 each; from twenty to thirty of them are destroyed in a night. The whole country, for twenty miles around, is full of these ruinous proceedings, nor can they be checked, Nottingham gaol is full of debtors; and the country is equally distressed. no trade; no money. This has been the case for two months. This town is now a garrison, and strictly under martial law. God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin. 

Later accounts down to the 18th inst. state that no advantage has resulted from the expected Meeting of the manufacturers, but that the parties broke up without coming to any decision.

Editorial in the Leeds Mercury

We are more concerned than surprised to find, that a Spirit of Riot and Insubordination has broken out in the county of Nottingham amongst the suffering Manufacturers. As it frequently happens on such occasions, the cause of the distress of these unfortunate people is mistaken; they imagine, it seems, that the low rate of wages and the scarcity of work arise from some improvement in the Stocking weaving Frames, and their vengeance is directed against the owners of these inoffensive implements of labour; but they ought to be informed that the real cause of the evils of which they so loudly and justly complain, is the long continuance of a heart-sickening war, without visible object, and apparently without end, and which has in its consequences damied up all the regular outlets of trade; and if instead of sacking the workshops of their employers, who are in general deep participators in the sufferings of the labouring classes, they would unite with the other manufacturers throughout the kingdom in petitioning the proper authorities, first to inform them what it is we are fighting for; and secondly, if the object does not justify the sacrifices, to put a stop to the horrors and miseries of this contest, they would act much more wisely and have a much better chance of seeing an end of their grievances, than by their present lawless and senseless proceedings. We do most sincerely commiserate their situation, but we utterly condemn the means by which they seek to obtain redress.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 29 February 1812

MACHINERY DESTROYED

It is with deep regret we have to state that outrages of a most alarming description and extent, have been recently committed in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. On the night of Saturday last, a number of persons assembled near the premises of Mr. Joseph Hirst, of Marsh, with their faces blacked, and their persons in other respects disguised, and having forcibly obtained admittance in to the dressing shops, proceeded to destroy all the machinery used in the dressing of cloth such as dressing frames, shears, and other implements used in what is commonly call Gig Mills, the whole of which they completely demolished. The same, or a similar party then proceeded to the workshops of Mr. James Balderson, of Crossland Moor, in which machinery of the same description was employed, in which they committed similar depredations, completely destroying or rendering useless the whole of the machinery. The manner in which these outrages were perpetrated, was this—The depredators, or to use the cant terms, Luddites, assemble with as much privacy as possible, at the place marked out for attack, and divide themselves into two parties, the more daring and expert of which enter the premises, provided with proper implements for the work of destruction, which they accomplish a with astonishing secrecy and dispatch. The other party remain conveniently stationed at the outside of the building, to keep off all intruders, or to give the alarm, if a superior force, was likely to be opposed to them. As soon as the work of destruction was completed, the Leader drew up his men, called over the roll, each man answering to a particular number instead of his name; they then fired off their pistols, (for they were armed,) gave a shout, and marched otf in regular military order. They do not appear to have done any mischief besides breaking the machinery; and one of the party having asked the Leader what they should do with one of the Proprietors, he replied, not hurt a hair of his head; but that should they be under the necessity of visiting him again, they could not shew him any mercy.

The depredations appeared to the Magistrates to be of so alarming a nature, as to induce them to apply to General Vyse, of Beverley, for military aid, who dispatched an express to this town, with an order for the Troop of Scotch Greys stationed in this town, to proceed immediately to Huddersfield, and which marched at 11 o'clock on Monday night, for that place. And it not being thought expedient to leave this town without military, a squadron of Cavalry was marched from Sheffield, and arrived about nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, and in the afternoon of the same day, a squadron of the 2nd Dragoon Guards, arrived from York, and on Wednesday proceeded to Huddersfield, to relieve the Scotch Grey's who returned to this town on Thursday. The Cavalry from Sheffield left this place on Thursday morning. These military movements have naturally created much anxious curiosity, but no disposition has been evinced in this neighbourhood, to disturb the public peace.

On Wednesday night, notwithstanding the presence of the Military, a party broke into a Mill situated between Slaithwaite and Huddersfield, and carried on their work of destruction there in a similar manner.

YORKSHIRE LENT ASSIZES

...

Mr. Justice Le BLANC addressed the Grand Jury in nearly the following terms:—

"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY,  
"Assembled as we are at present in the ordinary discharge of a duty you have so often been called upon to perform; I should have felt it unnecessary to trouble you with any observations if a case had not occurred which seemed from its infrequency to require some notice. The list of offences, though somewhat longer than usual, does not appear to contain many cases of novelty, and I hoped to have had the pleasure of congratulating the County of York in having escaped the contagion of that system of depredation which has continued so long and occasioned such extensive mischief in a neighbouring county, but this hope has not been fully realised; I am grieved to find from a case in the Calendar, and from information received since we arrived here, that this county has not entirely escaped the influence of bad example; but I trust there will be found not only sufficient vigilance in the magistracy to suppress these disorders; but, also courage in the subjects, to protect their property from the attacks of these depredators. The advantages of machinery in manufacture has been so clearly proved, and the subject so ably discussed, that it excites surprize that any should be found so ignorant and infatuated as to imagine that the destruction of machinery should better the situation of the persons employed in manufactures. These absurd ideas have been refuted over and over again, not only by writers on the subject, but by the Judges in their different circuits, that one might have expected none could be found ignorant enough to be influenced by them, and I should have hoped no man would have been as wicked as to instil such mischievous notions into the minds of these deluded men. The Legislature has heretofore provided penalties and serious penalties for the protection of this species of property; all that is required is that the law should be put in force, which can only be by vigilance and courage in detecting offenders. I only find one case in the Calendar which has any refer to this subject, and that person, most fortunately for himself, was by the prompt exertions of a Magistrate arrested, perhaps before he had completed the offence. He will probably be prosecuted under some of the provisions of what is called the Black Act, an Act passed to repress certain enormities in the reign of George I. committed by persons armed and disguised by blacking their faces, and as prosecutions under this act are extremely rare, I take the liberty of pointing out to you the words of the Act, 'If any person or persons being armed with swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, and having his or their faces blacked, or being otherwise disguised, shall appear in any forest, park, &c. *or in any high road*, and shall be convicted thereof, they shall be adjudged guilty, of felony.'

"Two circumstances it will be observed are necessary to constitute this offence, that the person should be armed, and should be disguised by having his face blacked, and in the present instance perhaps it will appear, but of this you will judge when the case comes before you, that this person was discovered before the offence was completed, and that only one of these circumstances can be proved against him; he was evidently on the verge of committing a capital felony, from which he was, perhaps fortunately for himself, withheld by being taken into custody. You will therefore inquire not only as to his person being disguised, but as to the fact of his being armed with offensive weapons, as swords, fire-arms, or other weapons, calculated to injure or terrify his Majesty's subjects. I have presumed to make these observations because a case of this kind may not have come before you, and in a statute so extremely penal there ought to be satisfactory grounds for putting a person upon his trial before another Jury, who in such case will have ultimately to decide upon his guilt or innocence.

..."

The Bill against James Shaw, of Leeds, clothdresser, charging him with having disfigured his person by blacking his face, and with being unlawfully armed with offensive weapons, was thrown out, by the Grand Jury, on Wednesday; and he was, of course, discharged without being put upon his trial.

RIOTS

FATAL CONFLICTS

We have made it our business to collect a faithful narrative of the sanguinary contest that last Saturday night took place at Rawfolds, between the men calling themselves the army of General Ludd and the persons employed in guarding the property of Mr. Cartwright, in order to place upon record the particulars of an event that will survive in local remembrance the present generation; and we can undertake to say, that the following narrative may be implicitly relied upon: —

It is known to our readers that the use of machinery for raising and dressing woollen-cloth has of late become very unpopular amongst the shearmen in this part of the country; and that all mills where machinery this kind is in use have been marked out for destruction, and that in several of them the obnoxious machines have been destroyed.

At Rawfolds, near Cleckheaton, a place at an equal distance from Huddersfield and Leeds, from each of which it is about eight miles, a gentleman of the name of William Cartwright has a mill used for the purpose of dressing cloth in the way objected to by the men; on this mill it was understood that an attempt was to made, and on Thursday night, the 9th inst. the centinel at the mill observed several signals that were supposed to indicate an approaching attack, though both that and the following night passed over without molestation. On Saturday night, about half-past twelve o'clock, there was a firing heard from the north, which was answered from the south, and again from west to east; this firing was accompanied by other signals and in a few minutes a number of armed men surprised the two centinels without the mill, and having secured both their arms and their persons, made violent attack upon the mill, broke in the window-frames, and discharged a volley into the premises at the same instant. Roused by this assault, the guard within the mill flew to arms, and discharged a heavy fire of musketry upon the assailants; this was returned and repeated without intermission during the conflict, the mob attempting all the time to force an entrance, but without success, a number voices crying continually "Bang up!" Murder them !" "Pull down the door!" — and mixing these exclamations with the most horrid imprecations. Again and again the attempts to make a breach were repeated, with a firmness and constancy worthy a better cause; but every renewed attempt ended in disappointment, while the flashes from the fire-arms of the insurgents served to direct the guards in their aim. For about 20 minutes this engagement continued with undiminished fury, till at length, finding all their efforts to enter the mill fruitless, the firing and hammering without began to abate, and soon after the whole body of the assailants retreated with precipitation, leaving on the field such of their wounded as could not join in the retreat. An attempt was made to rally their scattered forces, to carry off their wounded, but it was in vain; the fire from within had been kept up with so much steadiness and perseverance as to produce universal dismay; during this spirited engagement 140 balls were discharged from the mill; what number of shots were fired by the mob, it is impossible to say, but the doors and windows were perforated with a vast number of pistol and musket balls, though none of them took effect, not one of the guards having sustained the least persona] injury. During the principal part of the engagement the alarm-bell was rung, and a quantity of large stones were hurled from the roof, which had an instantaneous effect, otherwise a quantity of oil of vitriol, in reserve, would have been poured down.

On the cessation of the firing, the ears of the guards were assailed with the cries of two unfortunate men, weltering in their blood, and writhing under the torture of mortal wounds:— "For God's sake," cried one of them, "shoot me— put me out of my misery!" — "Oh !" cried the other, "help! help!—I know all, and I will tell all." On the arrival of a detachment of the Queen's Bays, which took place about an hour after the attack commenced, these ill-fated men were removed on litters from the field to the Star Inn, at Robert Town, and medical aid was called in with all possible dispatch. One of them proved to be a cropper, of the name of Hartley, formerly in the employment Mr. Cartwright; a fine-looking young unmarried man, about 24 years of age, and a private the Halifax Local Militia, in which regiment Mr. Cartwright is Captain. The other was John Booth, a youth about 19 years of age, son of a clergyman in Craven, and an apprentice to Mr. Wright, of Huddersfield, tinner. Hartley had received a shot in his left breast, apparently while making a blow at some part of the mill, which, passing through his body, lodged beneath the skin at the left shoulder, from whence it was extracted with a portion of bone. In this situation he languished till three o'clock on Monday morning, when he expired. Booth's wound was in his leg, which was shattered almost to atoms; it was found necessary that he should submit to have the leg amputated, but owing to the extreme loss of blood before the surgeons arrived, spasms came on during the operation, and he died about six o'clock on Sunday morning; having previously observed, that if he should recover, "he would never be brought into such a scrape again." It was observed that neither of these victims of lawless violence manifested any sense of religion. Booth was interred at Huddersfield, on Thursday morning, at six o'clock and Hartley at Halifax, on Wednesday; and they were both attended to their graves by a vast concourse of spectators. `[In the Chester Courant, this last sentence is replaced by: "On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered."]`

On the morning after the engagement a number of hammers, axes, false-keys and picklocks, with two masks, a powder-horn, and a bullet-mould were found upon the field, which was stained in several places with blood: and it is evident that many others besides those left on the field were wounded, as traces of gore were distinctly traced in almost every direction, and in one place to the distance of four miles. The assailants have much to rejoice that they did not succeed in entering the building, from we speak from our own observation when we say, that had they effected an entrance, the death of a vast number of them from a raking fire which they could neither have returned nor confronted, would have been inevitable. It is unnecessary to speak of the heroism of the little band that guarded these premises, there is not perhaps upon record a more distinguished instance of cool intrepidity; but it may be proper to add, that the number of military on the mill was very small, and one of that number conducted himself in so unsoldierlike a manner, that he was on the following morning placed in a confinement, and now awaits the issue of a Regimental Court Martial. `[The Chester Courant differs slightly: *though the assailants exceeded hundred, the numbers opposed to them were very inconsiderable*.]`

A number of reflections arise out this narrative, but we shall content ourselves with one remark: we have of late frequently deemed it our duty, from the regard we feel to the labouring classes, and to the laws of our country, to warn those that are engaged in these violent proceedings, of the fatal consequences that await them in the unequal contest in which they are now waging with the civil and military power of the country. —Let them reflect deeply on the fate of Hartley and Booth—let them recollect that they themselves may be the next victims, and let them stop this desperate career before it is too late.— On Monday a Coroner's Inquest assembled upon the dead bodies, and returned a verdict of— *Justifiable Homicide*. None of the wounded men except Hartley and Booth have yet been discovered.

On Thursday se'nnight about twelve o'clock at night, the extensive Cloth Manufactory of Mr. Joshua Foster, of Horbury, was surrounded by a large body of men, armed with muskets, hatchets and clubs, who broke into the Dressing-shops and totally destroyed all the shears and frames and other utensils used in the finishing of cloth; but not content with this, they did considerable injury to the machinery employed in the other part of the business, and respecting which they do not profess to have any ground of complaint. The doors and windows were also broken in pieces, and the damage done to the latter is estimated at 100*l.*. and to conclude the whole, set fire to the premises, but which was happily extinguished before it communicated to the main body of the building At the commencement of these outrages, a party of about twenty broke into the Dwelling-house by the sons of Mr. Foster, whom they treated with the utmost indignity, compelling two of them to get out of bed and lie upon the floor tied together, and obliged the other to give up the keys and go with them to unlock the doors; but this ceremony they might have dispensed with, as the great body of the depredators had already effected many practicable breaches and made an considerable progress in the work of destruction, The Dwelling-house of the Book-keeper was also broken into and his family treated with the most brutal violence. Previous to the assault these assailants had the precaution to secure all the approaches to the premises, and after the work of destruction was completed, their leader assembled them in a neighbouring field, called over the muster-roll, and each man having answered to his number, told them "that their work was done, and all was well, and might disperse." The number assembled on this occasion was about 400, about eight of whom were mounted on horses. Several discharges of fire-arms took place; but it is imagined to be only with powder, as no marks of any shot were observed.

HUDDERSFIELD- This place has been all hurry and confusion during the present week, but no depredations have been committed.— A special sessions was holden here on Monday last, and several persons underwent examinations before the Magistrates respecting the late desperate attack at Mr. Cartwright's mill, but nothing material could be discovered. — The Magistrates came to the resolution of enforcing the Watch and Ward Act in this town.—Booth, who died of his wounds, was interred here at 6 o'clock on Thursday morning, great numbers of people poured in from all quarters during the morning in expectation of seeing the funeral which was over before the majority of them arrived; all is now quiet.— Huddersfield wears the aspect of a town under military power night and day.— What will Napoleon say to this?`[This paragraph was widely syndicated, but the last sentence is replaced by "Hartley was interred at Halifax the preceding day with considerable parade; a number of the persons who followed him to his grave were dressed in mourning and wore round their arm a bandage of white crape."]`

[Further down includes an excerpt from the Watch and Ward Act.]

## Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 April 1812

On Saturday, a regimental Court martial was held at Huddersfield, on the private, who mis-conducted himself at the attack on Rawfolds mill, in refusing or neglecting to defend it in the manner he ought to have done, he was guilty of neglect of duty, and was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. On Tuesday morning, he was marched, escorted by a detachment of dragoons, to Rawfold the scene of action, where he was tied sip, and received about 25 lashes, the remainder of his punishment being remitted at the earnest and repeated intercession of Mr. Cartwright.

On Saturday last, an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. Cartwright, the intrepid defender of Rawfolds Mill, by two villains who fired at him from behind an hedge, as he was returning from Huddersfield. The shots were discharged at nearly the same moment from opposite sides of the road, but happily without effect. This diabolical attempt upon the life of this gentleman, took place in open day, between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, about a mile on this side of Huddersfield. We have no words which can sufficiently describe our abhorrence of this dark and wicked attempt to murder. Surely, even the deluded followers of Gen. Ludd, cannot approve of private deliberate murder; are his troops already degenerated into a band of assassins? But wickedness is progressive, it is a downward road, the first step prepares the mind for a second, that for a third, until deeds of blood become familiar. And the man who begun his career, probably with the intention only of destroying machinery which he supposed inimical to his interest, ends it by deliberate assassination, There is something in this crime so cowardly, so foreign to the feelings of Englishmen, and so much at variance with the courage and humanity of our national character, that we are convinced, that not one man would have been found to have entered into the association, if it had previously intimated to him, that he was to exchange the character of an Englishman, for that of a cruel and cowardly Italian desperado. We would exhort and conjure those who are yet innocent of the blood of their fellow-creatures, to abjure a confederation which leads to such dreadful consequences, which sinks them below the level of civilized men, and points to the destruction of Society itself. It is at present possible to retreat; when we have next to address them, it may be too late.

The Committee of the association of Merchants and Manufacturers at Huddersfield, hove voted their thanks to Mr. Cartwright, for his intrepid and gallant conduct in the defence of his Mill at Rawfolds, by which he has rendered the most essential service to his country. The Committee have also presented Fifty Guineas to the men, under the command of Mr. Cartwright, for having so bravely and steadily performed their duty in this trying occasion

ATROCIUS MURDER. On Tuesday evening last,  at about half past six o'clock, as Mr. WILLIAM HORSFALL a very extensive Wollen Manufacturer at Marsden, about seven miles from Huddersfield, was returning from the market at that place, he was assassinated on the public road, on Crossland Moor.

The circumstances, as stated to us by an eye-witness of this most barbarous Murder are these:— Mr. Horsfall and a Manufacturer, of the name of EASTWOOD, had left Huddersfield together, and at a short distant before they came to the fatal spot, Mr. Eastwood stopped to water his horse, while Mr. Horsfall rode leisurely along the road; when he had came within about 500 yards of the Warren Inn, a distance of about a mile and a half from Huddersfield, on the Manchester road, four men, each armed with a horse pistol, who had just before stepped out of a small plantation, placed the barrels of their pistols in appertures in the wall, apparently prepared for that purpose; the muzzel of two of these pieces Mr. Horsfall distinctly saw, but before he had time to extricate himself from his perilous situation, they all four fired, and inflicted four wounds in the left side of their victim, who instantly fell from his horse, and the blood flowed from the wounds in torrents. A number of passengers both horse and foot rushed almost instantly to the spot, and, after disentangling his foot from the stirrup, he was some difficulty got to the Inn.

The Murderers, after they had perpetrated the sanguinary deed, walked to the distance of some yards, and soon after briskening their speed, they ran towards Dungeon Wood, and entirely escaped undiscovered, no pursuit or search having been made after them, till the arrival of a troop of the Queen's Bays, about three quarters of an hour afterwards. One of the Assassins is described to us as about six feet high, another as a low portly man, and the two others as about five feet six or seven inches high, and rather slender; they all wore dark coarse woollen coats, and appeared to be working men.

From a professional Gentleman, who was called in to visit Mr. Horsfall, we learn, that three of the wounds, out of the four, were slight, and unattended with danger, but the fourth made by a musket ball, which entering the abdomen on the left side had taken a downward direction, and lodged in the back part of the right thigh, from which it was extracted on Wednesday, along with a pistol ball, at which time, some faint hopes were entertained of the patient's recovery; but on Thursday morning, about five o'clock, a profuse bleeding came on, accompanied by mortification, by which the thigh was swollen to an enormous size, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning, he expired, in perfect possession of his faculties.

Mr. Horsfall had a very large Woollen Manufactory at Marsden, wherein about 400 work people were employed; and in a part of his premises there are Shearing Machines, which have been erected about seven years, and have attained considerable perfection; this circumstance, with the additional one of his unremitting activity in detecting, and bringing to justice the persons engaged in the attack at Rawfolds, and other Mills, had rendered him obnoxious in a high degree to the machine destroyers, who knowing his premises were too well defended to justify an attack on his property, committed a crime against his person, that will embitter every future day of their existence, and, that will, in all probability through the retributive justice of that Being, from whom no secrets are hid, bring the blood-stained perpetrators of this worst of crimes, to an ignominious end.

A reward of £2000 will, we understand, be offered immediately to any person who will give such information as will lead to the conviction of any one or more of the four men concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall.

Huddersfield, May 7, 1812  

MR EDITOR—I am sorry to inform you the Luddites have been very active in collecting arms this last week, and have been too successful. They proceeded to peoples' houses, in the townships of Almondbury, Wooldale, Farnley, Netherthong. Meltham, Honley, and Marsden, and many other places in this neighbourhood; they entered the houses by about 20 or 30 in a gang, and demanded all the arms in the house, on pain of instant death. By this means they have obtained possession of upwards of 100 stand of arms since my last letter to you, and not one night has passed without some arms having been so taken. In order to check this alarming evil, Major Gordon has obtained possession of 200 stand of arms from the inhabitants in this neighbourhood; the military are in this manner daily employed in collecting arms, but they have not yet been fortunate enough to discover the depot of the Luddites.

A person, who appears a very suspicious character, was apprehended in Saddleworth, last Tuesday. and committed to Towzer here, and who will undergo an examination before the magistrates here tomorrow.

The Coroner's Inquest sat on the body of Mr. Horsfall last Thursday, and returned a verdict of *Wilful Murder* against some person or persons unknown. He was interred at Huddersfield parish-church, in a very private manner, last Saturday morning— few people knew till the funeral was over. It is presumed the business will be carried on at Marsden as usual.

You was misinformed with respect to Major Gordon's stable set on fire; the stable belonged to Mr. Allen Edwards, King-street, who wishes this mistake to be rectified; Mr. Edwards is a special constable, and had rendered himself obnoxious to the incendiaries by the vigilant discharge of his duty.

THE MERCURY `[Editorial commenting on the announcement on June 16, 1812 that the Orders in Council, which called for a blockade of French trade with Britain, France's allies, or neutral countries, including the Americans, would be suspended. ]`


... There is one observation stated in the reports of Mr Rose's speech, which will astonish every man acquainted with the present situation of the Staple Manufacturer of this Country; that Gentleman is stated to have said, that "there was no evidence of distress in the West Riding of Yorkshire." No evidence of distress in the West-Riding! The man that could make such an assertion, could not have read or heard the evidence given by Mr. George Rawson, Mr. William Thompson, Mr. Joseph Walker, Mr. Christopher Lawson, or Mr. John Oxley, and a number of other witnesses! We do intreat our readers to peruse with attention the evidence of those gentlemen, than whom there is not amongst us more respectable and intelligent men, and then to say how far Mr. Rose is justified in the assertion that there is no evidence of distress in the West Riding of Yorkshire. And if that evidence of distress does not satisfy him, we beg to remind him, that in visits lately made through the town of Leeds, by persons whose duty it was to inquire diligently into the situation of the poor, out of a population of about 9000 families, of which this town consists, there were found 3500 families that stood in need of the contributions of the benevolent, and that of those 3500 families, the average sum that each individual had to subsist upon, did not exceed 2s. 10d. a head, and at a time too when flour is from 5s. to 6s. a stone, and in a place too where the poor are in a better situation than perhaps any other manufacturing town in the county. Is not this some evidence that there is distress in the West Riding.

...

LEEDS, SATURDAY, JUNE 20

...

Last Sunday morning, at half past four o'clock, the Woollen Mill, called Gibraltar Mill, the property of Messrs. Thackray and Carlisle, situated near Pudsey, was discovered to be on fire, and so rapid was the progress of the flames as to reduce the building to a mere shell in less than an hour. By this casualty about 80 work-people are thrown out of employment, and ten Stocks, nine Billies, nine Carding Machines, and eleven Slubbing Machines, besides a quantity of other machinery, and the wood-work of the Steam Engine, are totally destroyed, together with about 60 Pieces of Woollens, and Wool for about 150 Cloths, involving a loss at from 6 to 7000*l*. Of this amount 5000*l* was insured in the Sun Fire Office. For some time a report prevailed that this Mill, which was one of the most complete buildings of the kind in the West Riding of York, had been fired by the hand of an incendiary, and was connected in some way with the depredations that have of late so unhappily prevailed in the manufacturing parts of the country; but this rumour, we are happy to find from enquiry on the spot, rests on no authority whatever, On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that the fire originated in a quantity of wool prepared a with fish oil, having been placed in the N. E. corner of the building, and suffered to remain accumulated till it burst out into a flame, and involved the whole premises in destruction.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 27 June 1812

Our Huddersfield Correspondent under the date of the 25th instant says:—

"Last Monday about midnight, a great number of armed men, with their faces disfigured by broad black marks down each cheek and over the forehead, assembled near the dwelling-house of Mr. Fisher, a shop-keeper, at Briestwistle, in this neighbourhood, and after firing two guns or pistols, demanded admittance into Mr. Fisher's house, which he refused. They then broke open the door, and wo of them rushing into the house, seized Mr. Fisher, who had just got out of bed; they each presented a pistol to his breast, and threatened him with instant death if he stirred a foot. Not intimidated by this threat, Mr. Fisher rushed from them towards the door, when he was seized by other six men, who placing a sheet over his head, face and arms, kept him in that situation while their comrades ransacked the house, and took from his pocket-book bills to the amount of the 116*l.* besides 21*l.* in notes and some cash; they also took a quantity of notes and cash out of a drawer, but to what amount Mr. Fisher does not exactly know. When the depredation was completed, the Leader cried out to the guard placed over Mr. Fisher, "Let him go; don't hurt him; we have got what we wanted, and we will bring it back in three months," and immediately made off.

A man of the name of James Oldroyd, was apprehended at Dewsbury, on Tuesday evening last, by a troop of the Queen's Bays, sent from hence for that purpose, on suspicion of having been concerned in the attack on Mr. Cartwright's Mill at Rawfolds. He underwent an examination  yesterday morning, at Mills-Bridge *(sic)*, before Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. when he was committed to York-Castle to take his trial at the ensuing Assizes.

We have considered it our duty to inquire, with more than ordinary diligence, into the reports of discoveries made, and excesses committed in this county, during the last ten days, some of which, in a very exaggerated form, have found their way into the London Papers, and the following is the result of our inquiries:

On the 20th ult. the Luddites, about twenty in number, entered the house of Mr. John Wood, a shopkeeper at Huddersfield, and carried away a pistol and a small cask of gunpowder. On Friday the 3d est. parties of the same description, entered the houses of Mr. Benjamin Dyson and Mr. Wm. Mellor, of Stainiland, near Halifax, and took from each a gun and a sword. The same night, another party, about ten in number, armed and disguised, several of them with their shirts over their coats, attacked the family of Mr. Megson, a carpenter, residing near the Porter's-Lodge, at Whitley-Hall; after securing the family in a back room, they proceeded to rifle the drawers, and took away four Guinea Notes and some provisions. They did not demand any fire-arms. A person of the name of Patrick Doring, alias Dr. Bell, of Scholes, near Holmfirth, was apprehended on Tuesday, and was the following day committed to York Castle on a charge of endeavoring to intimidate witnesses from appearing at York in evidence against the rioters at the ensuing Assizes. —A person of the name of Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a Corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local-Militia, has been apprehended, charged on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place.— This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes of which he is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to a mental infirmity under which he is said to labour when he has "put an enemy is his mouth to steal away his brains." The story in the London Papers about the apprehension of 50 men, &c. is an entire fabrication, though two Police officers have been in that neighbourhood in disguise for some time, and the Military, both horse and foot, are very active, and were on duty all Wednesday night.

HOUSE OF COMMONS.-Wednesday, July 8.  
SECRET COMMITTEE.  

Mr. Leicester brought up the Report of the Secret Committee appointed to examine the sealed Packet of Papers laid before the House by order of the Prince Regent. The Report was then read at the Table. It stated that alarming disturbances, destructive to property, prevailed in the counties of Lancaster, York, &c. and had continued from the month of March down to the latest accounts on the 23d of June. That the rioters assembled in the night-time, with their faces blackened, armed with the implements of their trades, and other offensive instruments, with which they destroyed the property of those who were obnoxious to them. That they had in many instances written threatening letters—had proceeded the length of setting fire to the houses of individuals, and even that an atrocious murder had been committed on a person of the name of Horsfall, by four persons, who there was every reason to believe were accomplices in these disturbances. That great dread and alarm was occasioned in consequence of these proceedings; and that in some instances sums of money were demanded and extorted. The Committee, without entering into details, thought it necessary to state that the first object of these Rioters seemed to be the breaking of machinery; but they had in many instances resorted to measures infinitely more alarming, namely, the demanding of arms; and had even carried them off, in many instances where they allowed every other species of property to remain untouched. These seemed not to be the effect of any sudden impulse, but of an organized system of lawless violence. Sometimes the Rioters were under the control of Leaders; and were distinguished not by names but by numbers; were known to each other by signs and countersigns; and carried on all with the utmost caution. They also took an oath, that while they existed under the canopy of Heaven they would not reveal any thing connected with the present disturbances, under the penalty of being put out of existence by the first brother whom they should meet, &c. It did not appear to the Committee that any sums of money were distributed'among the rioters. It was extremely difficult to discover them. It was held out to them that they might expect to be joined by other discontented persons from London, and that there were persons in the higher ranks who would also lend them support; but of these insinuations the Committee were not able to find evidence. They had adopted and submitted to a military discipline; they had regular muster-rolls. They used rockets and blue lights for communication with each other. They had also their Committees and Sub-Committees, and Secret Committees, and had their regular signs and counter-signs, by which they made their written communications; not, however, through the ordinary channel of the Post-office. It further appeared, that two-pence a week was appointed to be paid by each member to their respective Delegates; but that, in many instances, it had been found difficult to collect this weekly tax. In consequence of which some disturbances had taken place amongst themselves. Whatever was their object, however, and whoever were the secret movers of these disturbances, yet the secrecy with which they were carried on, the attempts at assassination that had been made, the oaths that had been administered, and the system of terror that prevailed, had not failed to impress the Committee deeply.

On the motion that the Report do lie on the table, Mr. Ponsonby wished to know if the Right. Hon. Gent. opposite intended to move that the Report be printed and taken into consideration? ...

no politics involved also in Hampshire Chronicle - Monday 17 February 1812

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000076/18120718/007/0003
## Leeds Mercury - Saturday 18 July 1812

ON Monday, in the House of Commons, LORD CASTLEREAGH introduced a Bill into Parliament founded on the Report of the Secret Committee appointed to examine and report on the Documents sent to the House by the PRINCE REGENT, on the disturbed state of this and the neighbouring Counties. The main object of this Bill is to increase, for a limited period, the poower of the Magistrates, by enabling them to search for stolen and secreted Arms, without any information upon oath;—to disperse tumultuous Assemblages without waiting an hour, as they are at present obliged to do, and to apprehend and hold to bail the persons so assembled. The Bill also provides, that the Magistrates in one of the disturbed Counties shall have a concurrent jurisdiction in the adjoining Counties. It also gives them a power, under certain limitations and conditions, of demanding the Arms of any individual, on receipts being given for the same. Though this Bill certainly vests large powers in the Magistracy—powers which, if abused, might lead to the most calamitous effects; yet, as the evil to be avoided is of great magnitude, and cannot be coped with without some legislative enactment, it is perhaps, upon the whole, a necessary evil. If, indeed, Lord Castlereagh's suggested Amendment, of introducing men unqualified, in point of property, into the Magistracy, should form a part of this Bill, it would completely alter its whole complexion, and place the liberty and safety of every man at the disposal of any minion, Administration might think proper to introduce into the commission. Such a proposal, we should suppose, would be indignantly scouted by the independent and truly respectable Magistrates of this County. We hope Lord Castlereagh will recollect that he is not legislating for Ireland.

THIS Bill was opposed by Mr. Whitbread and some other Members, on the grounds that the existing laws, if executed with vigour, were sufficient to restore the public peace; that a cessation of the disturbances might be expected as the result of the rescinding of the Orders in Council, and that there was no evidence to lead to the suspicion that they arose from any other cause than commercial distress.

Mr WILBERFORCE, in combating these objections, insisted that these disturbances ought not to be considered as the mere ebulitions of discontent arising from the pressure of distress, but as originating in political causes—in disaffection to Government, produced by mischievous publications industriously disseminated among the lower classes of society, by which they became alienated from the Government under which they lived. This charge of disaffection preferred by the Member of Yorkshire against his Constituents, is as groundless as the cause to which he attributes it—the dissemination of mischievous publications among the people. A more unfounded assertion was never made within the walls of Parliament. And we are persuaded that every one will be convinced of this who will examine the proceedings of these violators of the public peace, from the first frame-breaking in Nottingham, to the present moment. From such a review, it seems to us most clear, that the views of these deluded men were confined simply to the destruction of Machinery, without any reference to any form of Government, or any like or dislike to any public men. It is not impossible, indeed, that since the intermixture of the large body of Spies into the Meetings of these mislead people, some suggestions of that kind may have been made; but it is perfectly clear, that with the origin and organization of the plan, political considerations had no influence.

WE have said, and we are convinced, neither MR. WILBERFORCE nor any other man can disprove the assertions, that politics had little or no influence in originating these unhappy disturbances; but though political *considerations* had no influence on the minds of the rioters, the riots themselves may, we believe, be traced to political *causes*, and we beg Mr. Wilberforce to make the inquiry whether his votes in Parliament are not amongst the number of those causes. He has, we know, been crying for the last twenty years, with more than ordinary zeal, in, the Church of Clapham, "Give us peace in our time;" but has he not for the same period, and with equal fervour, been saying in the Chapel of St. Stephen, "Give us war in our time?" and is it not to this heart-sickening war that most of our distresses, and agitations are to be attributed? In forming his judgment upon the causes of the disturbances in the manufacturing counties, he should inquire too, how far these anti-commercial decrees which have deprived the poor of labour and bread, influenced in their effects, the conduct of the disorders, and whether mechanics loitering about the streets for days and weeks together in idleness and want, were not likely to be devising and practising mischief. On the subject of the Orders in Council, we must however, do our worthy Representative the justice to say, that he did not persist in error to the *last*, for on the memorable debate when his relative, Mr Stephen, the champion of retaliatory edicts *fell sick*, and when these celebrated Orders in Council were struggling under their dying throes, Mr. Wilberforce, their former advocate, gave them a home thurst by recommending their *total* abrogation,  
"This was the unkindest cut of all,"  
they fell; and though the agitAtion to which they had given rise, have like the agitations of the sea outlived the blast that put them in motion, yet we do not doubt but the tranquilizing effects of the revocation will soon be felt in the disturbed counties—and that it will appear that it was not the licentiousness of the press but the distress of a famishing people, produced by the causes we have mentioned, that instigated, cherished, and extended the spirit of riot and outrage.

[Previous story above syndicated with a different closing and reference to Barrowclough being taken to Manchester.]

A person of the name Barrowclough, of Holmfirth, a corporal in the Upper Agbrig Local Militia, has been apprehended, charged, on his own confession, with having been concerned in the murder of Mr. Horsfall, and with having assisted in the attack on the Shearing Mill of Mr. Cartwright, at Rawfolds; but it appears, on investigation, that Barrowclough was at York with the regiment at the time the murder took place. This singular infatuation of accusing himself of crimes which is not, and could not be guilty, is attributed to mental infirmity under which he is said to labour. On the arrival of Barrowclough at Manchester, where he was taken for examination, for the purpose of placing him at a distance from his connections, he informed the Magistrates that there were two depots of arms, accumulated the disturbers of the public peace, one of them in the neighbourhood of Holmfirth, and the other near Grange Moor. On this information, about 300 of the Scotch Greys were dispatched from Manchester, Wednesday, into the Riding, and all the force in Huddersfield, civil and military, was ordered to co operate with the Greys in the seizure of the concealed arms; but after spending the whole night in a fruitless search, they returned to their quarters without making any discovery whatever. Having stated these facts, it is scarcely necessary to add, that the rumoured apprehension of 50 conspirators and of important discoveries made the police officers, is a mere fabrication —Leeds Mercury.

YORKSHIRE SUMMER ASSIZES

The Assizes were opened at York, on Saturday last, by Baron Wood and Mr. Justice Bayley, the latter of who presides at the Crown End.

[Mr. Justice Bayley, addressing the Jury]

[Cases included one of infanticide/murdering a deformed child]

...

Not having received the depositions connected with the rioters at Sheffield, I cannot give you any minute instructions with respect to them; but I will make this observation, that if there were a riotous association of persons, and those persons were proved to be amongst them, that would be sufficient evidence for you to proceed upon. It is not necessary to prove that they committed any specific act of violence, or that they displayed any particular activity in the riot. The law presumes, that every person present at a riot, and not opposing it, is aiding or abetting it; and it is certain that every person present gives to the rioters countenance and an appearance of strength. And so far does the law carry this, that if death to any one should arise from the violence of the rioters, every person present at the riot might be indicted for murder. It is right that this should be known, because many persons, from inadvertency, or from motives of curiosity, are apt to join riotous assemblages, without being aware of the consequences to which they expose themselves. No. 13, in the calendar, (James Haigh) is the case of a person committed on strong suspicion of being concerned in an attack upon a mill. On this I would remark, that if the evidence amounts only to what may be called a conjecture, or slight presumption, it would be advisable to throw out the bill; but it often happens that more evidence is laid before you than is contained in the depositions handed to me. You will consider the amount of the evidence, and if it be but slight, it would be better to reject the bill, unless you have reason to believe that you have all the evidence before you that can be collected on the case, because if you find the bill, and the party is tried and acquitted upon it, he can never be tried for that offence again, whatever evidence may come out; but if the bill is thrown out, he would be still amenable to the law, if subsequent evidence should render it expedient to apprehend him. I make these observations because it appears, from the depositions, that some persons refused to enter into recognizance to appear and give their evidence. It gives me concern to observe a disposition in any persons to obstruct the course of Justice; and the Magistrates would have been justified, and I wish they had so acted, in committing the persons, thus refusing, to prison.

...

With respect to the disturbances of which we have heard so much in this and the neighbouring counties, I do not observe that there are any cases in the Calendar of persons charged with being concerned in any recent outrage; and I am happy to find that the vigilance exercised by the Magistracy of this county, has already so materially checked and repressed this disposition to outrage, and I trust the exertion of the same vigilance will be effectual in totally suppressing those disorders. I feel, as an individual, no alarm on this subject. The machinations of those deluded and misled persons cannot ultimately succeed; they may produce for a time uneasiness and alarm, but must at length be put down; yet though on the ground of the public safety there is no ground of apprehension, it is highly desirable that the most prompt measures should be adopted to suppress these outrages, as their further continuance must bring down upon the persons concerned in them the most heavy and serious punishments.

If the labouring classes suffer from the high price of provisions, or have any other just ground of complaint, I am sure there will be found, in you and in the country, a disposition to afford them relief and redress. In no country (and I am proud to think I live in such a country) are the comforts of the poor more attended to, or more instant attention paid to their distresses than in this; and I am sure every practicable mode will be resorted to, to diminish the pressure they must feel from the high price of the necessaries of life. Gentlemen, if, by submitting to little privations ourselves, we can contribute to this, we shall have the satisfaction of reflecting, that we have done nothing to increase these troubles, nay more, that we have done all in our power to remove them; and if those people should be so unwise and so ungrateful as to persevere in their measures of hostility, we shall have the consolation of having done our duty.

... Trial of Sheffield Rioters ....


...

Wednesday July 22.-JAMES OLDROYD was charged with assembling, with divers other persons on the night of the 11th April, and there making an attack on the Mill of Mr. Cartwright, of Rawfolds, and with beginning to demolish the same.

This Prosecution was founded on an Act passed in the 9th of Geo. III. which makes it a capital felony for any person riotously to assemble and demolish any Mill, or to begin to demolish any Mill.

Mr. Park, Mr.Topping, and Mr. Richardson, were Counsel for the Prosecutor, and Mr. Raine for the Defendant.

Mr. Park stated the case to the Jury, in which he laid it down as the law of the case, that the violent breaking of windows, when evidently done with such instruments, and under such circumstances as shows the intent to be to demolish the building, is such a beginning to demolish as comes within the meaning of the Act. And that every person so present with the rioters giving them his countenance and aid, is as guilty in law though no individual act of violence can be personally proved against him.

[We shall, conformable to our usual custom, state the case from the evidence of the Witnesses.]

Mr Cartwright, the proprietor of the Mill, was called for the purpose of proving the riot and the nature of the attack upon the Mill. A circumstantial narrative of this having already appeared before the public, it may be sufficient merely here to add, that the attack was made about 20 minutes after 12 o'clock at night on the 11th April, by a considerable number of persons, but how many the darkness of the night did not give him the means of forming an opinion, the attack was made by fire-arms, hammers, mauls, and hatchets; all the windows on the side of the attack were broken almost instantaneously, the lower windows by the instruments mentioned, and the upper stories by discharges of ball and slugs. The firing continued incessantly for about 20 minutes, it was accompanied by cries of "*bang up— damn you are you in*—*in with you*—*kill them every one*." The party in the inside, of which the witness was one, repelled the charge by keeping up a constant fire on the assailants, but the darkness of the night was such that the only guide they had in directing their fire was the flash from the  discharge of the fire-arms of the assailants. Witness supposes about 120 shots were discharged from the building, and about the same number from without. The attack continued about 20 minutes, when the assailants retired. As soon as the Witness thought it prudent to open the door, he found that two wounded men had been left behind, (who afterwards died) and near the premises, in the direction in which the party had returned, a number of mauls, hatchets, picklocks, masks, and bullet moulds, were found, and which were produced in court. The wood work of the door, which was partially lined with iron, was entirely destroyed. The Witness said, he had no means of forming judgement whether the Prisoner was there or not, but he had no reasons to believe he was there. The Prisoner was a person of good character, and had no grounds for animosity against him.

Mr. Cartledge, of Brow-bridge, near Elland, said, he was returning from Wakefield, on the 22d June, accompanied by Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Woodhead, they called at the Black Bull, at Mirfield, for refreshment, and sat in the Bar, it was about eight o'clock in the evening, the room was separated from another room by a thin wood partition, in which there was a small window, the glass of which was partly broken, heard a person say in a loud tone of voice, "I was at Rawfolds on the night of the attack, I was engaged there, I was close by the two men that fell," the same voice said, that he never was in any association but one, and that was Ned or General Ludd's, (believes he used both expressions) had been in his service three years, that he had been faithful to him and would ever remain so. Witness said he spoke in a loud and boisterous tone of voice. Mr. Ashworth, one of the party, went for a Constable, and the Witness went into the Room and enquired which of the party had used that language. There were eight or ten persons in the room, he was pointed out to him by William Clarkson, and on the return of Mr. Ashworth, they prevailed on him to go with them into another room, where he denied having used the words imputed to him.— On his cross-examination he said the man appeared to have had liquor, but was not drunk and appeared to understand what he said and what was said to him; he said Mr. Cartwright knew him, and if they disputed his character he would get a letter of recommendation from him. Witness first heard of Gen. Ludd about a year ago. Witness said the Prisoner spoke so loud that he might have been heard by every person in the low part of the house.

Mr. Ashworth stated the conversation at the Black Bull in these terms:-I heard a voice say, as if in answer to some person who had been contradicting him "but I was at Rawfolds Mill that night, and I *was* engaged in the attack, and I saw the man fell," or the men. Witness believes both expressions were used at different times. The same voice further said, "I was never engaged in any association or society in my life but that of General or Ned Ludd, I have ever been true to it and I have been in it three years." Witness said these words were not used uninterruptedly as he had stated them, it was an interrupted conversation, and many of the expressions were repeated several times. After a consultation as to the course which it became their characters to pursue, it was determined to send for a Constable, and Witness went for one, but did not succeed; on his return, the Prisoner was pointed out to him, and when he spoke he recognised the same voice, but lower and softened. Witness proceeded to state what he heard of the conversation in the room to which they retired, which was the same in substance as stated by Mr. Cartledge; the Prisoner denied having used the expressions imputed to him; the Witness said he had no reason to believe that the Prisoner did not understand what he did or said; his spirits appeared to be elevated by the liquor he had taken. Nothing material occurred in has cross-examination, except that the Witness judging from the boisterous tone and manner in which the words were used, should have thought them the words of a crazy person.

Wm. Clarkson (the person referred to by Mr. Cartledge) stated that he was in the Black Bull public house on the night in question, and heard the conversation, heard the prisoner say he was at Rawfolds Mill the night it was attacked, that he was engaged in the attack, and that he was near to his fellow creatures when they fell; he never had entered into any society, but he would abide by it as long as he lived, Witness said he considered the Prisoner as drunk from first to last.

Joseph Senior was also present, heard part of the conversation, but did not much attend to it. Remembers the Prisoner saying he was at Rawfolds Mill the night it was attacked, and was engaged in the attack; did not hear him say any thing more; was not in the room when the conversation was begun, but the Prisoner and another person appeared to be talking one against the other. The Prisoner appeared to have two partners, (that is persons who were drinking with him) and one of them said to him, "hold thy peace, *if there be a good trade and meal come down, Ned Ludd will die*."-(A laugh.)

This finished the case on the part of the Prosecution.

Mr. Joseph Savage stated that he was a surgeon at Dewsbury, and attended the Prisoner, who was very subject to attacks of fever; he attended him up to the time of Pontefract Sessions, but was then under the necessity of being absent from the 6th to the 11th of April; left him medicines; he was in a debilitated state, and not able to endure much fatigue. Judging from what he saw of the Prisoner, it would have been dangerous for him to have been out on the night of the 11th of April. Witness saw him on the morning of the 12th, and, from his appearance, he should have supposed he had had his usual rest the preceding night.

Mary Ward sleeps in the house of the Prisoner, who is married, and has two children. She went to bed at ten o'clock on the 11th of April, at which time the prisoner was in bed. He sleeps in the room they usually live in. Her child being unwell and restless, she got up again about eleven o'clock, and came down stairs to the fire; the Prisoner was still in bed, and spoke to her, and complained that he could get no rest.—Witness soon after went to bed again, but her child continuing restless, she was under the necessity of getting up again. The clock then struck one. She remained up until near three o'clock, during which time the Prisoner frequently spoke to her, and, at the request of his wife, she gave him his medicine. The child being quiet, Prisoner advised her to go to bed, asking her what o'clock it was; she looked at the clock, and said it wanted a few minutes to three.— Witness got up at six o'clock in the morning, and went to her father's house; Prisoner was still in bed.

The Counsel for the Prosecution cross-examined her at considerable lengths, but she did not vary her testimony. She accounted for sleeping at the Prisoner's, by stating that her father had six children, and only two beds, and had not room for her and her child to sleep.

His Lordship summoned up the evidence with great particularity, and observed that the riot and the beginning to demolish the mill had been clearly proved, but the material question remained, which was, whether the Prisoner was present at the attack. If he was present he was guilty. That he was present there was the evidence of his own declaration. The Jury would consider, whether under all the circumstances of the case they could be fully convinced that these declarations were founded in truth; they would examine the manner and the circumstances under which they were made; and from a careful consideration of them, determine the degree of credit to which they were intitled. But it was right to state that these declarations, though fully proved, were not confirmed by any corroborating circumstances. On the part of the defence, there was the evidence of Mr. Savage, who appeared to be a respectable man, and the amount of whose testimony might fairly be stated as rendering it improbable that the Prisoner should be there. If the evidence of Mary Ward had full credit given to it, and there was nothing improbable or inconsistent in the account she gave, and her evidence had not been shaken by the cross-examination. If her testimony was believed, they must of necessity acquit the prisoner, as it was impossible he could have been there. The Jury would weigh all the circumstances of the case, and if upon the whole, they were convinced that the Prisoner's declaration at the public-house was true, they would find him guilty; but if they believed it was not true, or had a reasonable doubt upon the subject, they would acquit him.

The Jury, without leaving the box, found the prisoner-NOT GUILTY.

The verdict was received in perfect silence.

It may be proper here to add, that the most perfect order and decorum prevailed in the Court during the whole of the trials for rioting; and there is in the city no military parade, nor anything to indicate that the County is not in a state of the most profound tranquility and security.

ARMS STEALING

Thursday, July 23.—WILLIAM SYKES was charged with stealing a gun, in the dwelling-house of John Marsh, of Meltham, on the night of the 9th of May.

The Counsel for the Crown called William Wady, a private in the West Kent Militia, to prove a conversation in which the prisoner admitted that he was free, able and willing to serve General Ludd. But the Learned Judge said, he could not admit such irrelevant matter to be given in evidence.

James Kershaw knows the prisoner; saw him on the night of Saturday, the 9th of May, about eleven o'clock—he had a gun in his hand, and his face blacked. Prisoner said to him, "Well my lad, will you go with me a little journey?" Witness said, "No" But he followed him at a short distance, to see what he was about. He went to the house of John Marsh, of Meltham, about a quarter of a mile, and having roused them by knocking at the door, said, "I am informed you have a gun here; General Ludd has sent me for it, and if you do not deliver it up I will blow the door open." Witness heard the gun fired. The Prisoner was much intoxicated, and staggered in his walk.

Thomas Whiteley stated, that the Prisoner made the same proposal to him as to the last Witness, and said he was going to get John Marsh and Jonas Beardesley's guns. Witness went about forty yards with him, and turned back on the Prisoner, saying, "Ludders never speak." Witness in a short time heard the report of a gun, which appeared to be in the direction of Mr. Marsh's house. Witness did not observe that the Prisoner was intoxicated; did not think he was.

John Creaser, apprentice to Mr. Marsh, stated, that he was awaked by the report of a gun; he got up, and having received the gun which his master had given to him from the lodger, he delivered it to the person at the door. Being asked the reason of his readily giving it up, he said, there were so many reports about the Luddites, and he had been informed that they would not be denied. The firing of the gun had also made him afraid. When he delivered the gun, he said, "It has so lock;" on which the person at the door said, "It is well; it shall be well repaired, and, brought back in open day." Witness said the gun was brought back on the Monday following, but it was not repaired.

Mr. John Marsh, the master of the house, stated more precisely the terms in which the gun was demanded. After he had answered to the knocking at the doer, a person from without said, "We are informed you have a gun, and we are come for it."— Witness told them (for he supposed there were a number, though he only heard one voice) he had not a gun, and called to his apprentice not to give it up; but he supposes the boy did not hear him, as he gave them the gun. The gun was brought back on Monday night, by Joseph Whiteley. During the time the person was at the door, he heard him call out two numbers, as if calling to somebody, but the witness only heard the voice of one person.

Philip Earnshaw lent the prisoner a gun belonging to his master, on the night in question; he told him it was for a bit of fun, and wished the Witness to go with him. Witness went a short distance with him, but he left him, because he had some mischief in his head, he laughed so. Witness then went to the Prisoner's house, who returned in about half an hour, and brought back another gun with him. Witness did not examine the gun of his master, to see whether it had been recently discharged.

Joseph Whiteley stated, that he carried the gun back to Mr. Marsh, on Monday, the 11th of May.

This finished the case on the part of the Prosecution.

His Lordship said, he thought it unnecessary to call upon the Prisoner for his defence. There did not appear to have been any design to steal the gun — no bad use had been made of it— and it was returned to its owner before any search had been made for arms in the house of the Prisoner. It appeared to have been an idle, but most dangerous frolic, and for which he had been deservedly imprisoned. The Jury concurring in this opinion, found the Prisoner— *Not Guilty*.

...

James Haigh, of Dalton, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Joseph Arden and others, with being strongly suspected of having been one of the persons who riotously assembled and attacked the mill of Mr. William Cartwright, of Liversedge.-No Bill.

## Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 July 1812

The persons called Luddites it is said, may be divided into three classes— *Robbers*, men who wish to live by plunder, and avail themselves of the disturbed state of the country to carry on their villainous purposes. *Anti-Machinists*, persons who impute a difficiency of labour to the use of Machinery in shearing cloth, weaving cotton, and weaving hosiery; and *Spies*, men that have introduced themselves amongst the depredators to worm out information, and whose employment must cease with the disturbances. We should be glad to know to which of these classes the persons at present engaged in stealing arms belong; we have our suspicions; and cannot forget, that a man of the name of Watt, a spy, was executed at Edinburgh, about the year 1794, for an act of High Treason in which he had engaged while labouring in his vocation, in order to draw others into his snares. The history of this man is curious, and we will take an early opportunity of recalling it to public recollection.

On Wednesday morning in the plantation, adjoining the house of Mr. Tootal, of Wakefield, were found an hussar jacket and pantaloons, and a butcher's knife, the former of which had been stolen from the White Hart, and the latter from the common slaughter house in the course of the night. The purpose for which these were taken is yet to us a mystery, but we cannot help surmising that is must have been a very bad one.

Yorkshire Summer Assizes

The Judge's Address to the Grand Jury

Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,

MANY of you have so repeatedly served this office, and are so well acquainted with your duty, that were it not for a few peculiar cases, I should not have thought it necessary to trouble you with any observations upon the calendar. ... No. 19, in the calendar, (James Haigh) is the case of a person committed on strong suspicion of being concerned in an attack upon a mill. On this I would remark, that if the evidence amounts only to what may be called conjecture, or slight presumption, it would be advise-able to throw out the bill; but it often happens that more evidence is laid before you, than contained the depositions handed to me. You will consider the amount of the evidence, and if it be but light, it would be better to reject the bill, unless you have reason to believe that you have all the evidence before you that can be collected on the case, because if you find the bill, and the party tried and acquitted upon it, he can never be tried for that offence again, whatever evidence may come out; but if the bill is thrown out, he would be still amenable to the law, if subsequent evidence should render it expedient to apprehend him. I make these observations, because it appears from the depositions, that some persons refused to enter into recognisance to appear and give their evidence. It gives ma concern to observe a disposition in any persons to obstruct the course of justice; and the magistrates would have been justified, and I wish they had acted, in committing the persons, thus refusing, to prison.

... In No. 25, (James Oldroyd,) the evidence will probably mainly rest on the confession of the party; you will, therefore, inquire what corroborating circumstances there may be in the case, and whether the confession rests under the suspicion of being made by the undue influence of promises or threats. ...

THE MURDERERS OF MR. HORSFALL.  
We copy the following curious article from the Courier of Thursday the 29 ult.:-  
To the Editor of the Courier. Huddersfield, Oct. 24.

Sir.- A very important event happened here on Thursday last, of which as the Leeds Mercury of today does not appear to have had any information, I hasten to communicate the intelligence through the medium of your paper.

A man has been taken up and examined before that indefatigable Magistrate Joseph Radcliffe, Esq. and has at length received the offer of his Majesty's pardon, and given the most complete and satisfactory evidence of the horrible murder of Mr. W. Horsfall. In consequence of this, the whole of the wretches concerned in that dreadful transaction, have been taken and committed to York Castle, to take their trial at the ensuing Commission of Assize. — He was with the party (four in number) when Mr. Horsfall was shot.

They were furnished with loaded pistols by ——— who ordered them to take their stand in the Plantation on Crossland Moor. Two others soon after joined them, and took their station about twenty yards before then. When the unfortunate Gentleman came up, two fired. They then all fled across the fields, and ——— damned them all the way for not firing their pieces. Two ran forwards to Honley, four miles off, and two more stopped at a place called Dungeon Wood, and hid their pistols at ————'s house there, in some flocks— left their great coats, and ran immediately in their jackets to Huddersfield, where the news of the murder had but just arrived. The next morning they all four met at the work-shop of their employer (a cropper) and ———— produced a Bible. and made them all swear not to betray each other.

These villains have frequently been examined before, but have always been discharged for want of sufficient evidence. One behaved with the greatest effrontery till he saw ———, and then he changed colour and gasped for breath. When he came out, he said "Dam that ————, he has done me."

It appears ——— and ———— have been Chiefs in all the disgraceful transactions that have occurred in this part of the country the last twelve months, especially at Rawfolds, where the former was captain of the gun-division, and the latter of the pistol. ————— has thus made discoveries which will lead to the detection of a great number of these offenders, and, it is hoped, ultimately restore the West-Riding to its former tranquility.

Our Huddersfield correspondent, under the date of the 22d inst. says:—

"On Saturday night, the 10th inst. four villains went to the house of Mr. Joseph Hirst, clothier, at Lepton, near Huddersfield, and attempted to break open the door, when his son, Rd. [Richard] Hirst, who rushed out of the house to defend his father's was immediately fired at by one of the villains, and a ball went thro' his hat, took off a part of his hair and grazed the top of his head; but, fortunately, he sustained no other injury.—This house had been attempted several times before.—Mr. Radcliffe is employed in examining these infatuated people daily, from morning till night, and the police are hourly bringing them in."

TO DO - check from luddite bicentenary

SIR,—I beg the favour of you to permit your paper to the medium of a few observations on a subject in which, if I mistake not, the credit and the justice of this neighbourhood is considerably interested.

We cannot, I presume, have forgotten the state of the public mind, and the transactions which occurred during the spring months of the last year. We recollect the serious apprehensions which filled the minds of one part of the inhabitants; the disgraceful panic which seized others; the suspense in which a third sort were held, unable to form a judgment whether the disturbers of the public peace, or their opposers would prove to have taken the stronger side, and therefore afraid to commit themselves by venturing to express an opinion concerning transactions, which, by their novelty, their boldness, their ferocity, and general mischievous tendency, were becoming truly serious and alarming;—while, a lamentable proportion of the population of a great many of our towns and villages were in high and ardent expectation of some great change which they (foolishly enough, no doubt, but, which they) actually did imagine was about to take place in the persons should hold the power and property of the country.

At this time the idea of removing by violence such individuals as might seem likely to oppose any effectual obstacle to the system of destruction then in practice, was become perfectly familiar; the most atrocious acts were openly committed; murderous conversation was openly and undisguisedly held in workshops, at the market, in the public streets, and in public houses; while, whatever was offered in disapprobation of the then popular sentiments, and of the destructive practices, was generally spoken in retirement, under all the apparent emotions of apprehension, suspicion, and terror. There was an evident fear left what was said should be overheard and resented by the mischievous destruction of property of the speaker, or by his immediate assassination. Those who are first affected to scorn the expressions of alarm were themselves brought to dismay. Those who ignorantly imagined the business concerned such persons only as were connected with gig-mills and shearing-frames, were made to tremble for the safety of their own property and persons. The merchant, the farmer, the miller, the cottager, were alike assailed, terrified, plundered. The very atmosphere which surrounds us seemed contaminated, and the English character assumed for a season, the dark and baleful aspect of the malicious, relentless assassin.

A favourable change has taken place. The good sense of many of those who were incautiously led off to indulge unjustifiable wishes and expectations, is apparently returned; the momentary warmth of a perverted imagination has subsided, and given place to reflection, and a more just way of thinking. The silent and flow, but efficacious operation of our incomparable system of Laws, executed in that firm, manly, DISCRIMINATING CHRISTIAN spirit, so highly characteristic of our courts of justice, has had a powerful effect upon the public mind. The nature, the tendency, the absurdity, the madness of disorderly practices is more clearly discerned; the well-disposed are confirmed; the thoughtless are brought to some reflection; the guilty, we ardently hope, feel remorse; the vicious and abandoned have taken lessons of caution, and, it is reasonably to be expected, that the salutary pause that has been imposed upon them by the well grounded terror of the magistrate's awful arm, will be succeeded by some general repentance and reformation of conduct, and of principle.

The extent to which the mischievous combination might have been carried is not to be ascertained. The nature and tendency of it, is pretty well known.

A full year has now passed over us. We have had time for reflection. And it remains for us to determine whether we will suffer the intelligent faithful historian of the times to enter the following record for the information of posterity:

That one of the most villainous, of the MOST DESPERATE; and, for its extent, one of the MOST ALARMING CONSPIRACIES AGAINST the Security of the persons and property of civil society, that ever disgraced a country professing Christianity, was checked and disconcerted by the manly firmness of ONE MAN, at great labour, and at great personal hazard to himself, as well as at great expence:—and, the detection and conviction of the parties to this nefarious scene, was, in a great measure, "owing to the unremitting zeal and persevering courage of ONE MAGISTRATE residing near the town of Huddersfield:" but, such was the cool indifference betrayed by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood more immediately benefited by the judicious intrepidity of these two men, that, finding themselves delivered from their present apprehensions, they were content to refer the remuneration of the expences incurred by the meritorious defence of Rawfolds Mill, to the bounty of Government; to the PRIVATE liberality of individuals; to an "HUMBLE PETITION" to the Quarter Sessions; to chance:—and the worthy Magistrate of Mills-Bridge House was allowed to enjoy the satisfaction arising to an independent mind like his, from his private reflections on his own conduct; or,—whether we will do ourselves the credit, and our country the service, to offer our united public thanks to Mr. Radcliffe for the benefit he has conferred upon society, by his prompt, decisive, and judicious conduct; and testify our approbation of William Cartwright's behaviour, in defence of his person and property, and our sense of the advantages derived to society thereby by an instant public subscription expressly designed as a kind of vote of thanks, and to be offered to him independent of any notice or reward which the wisdom of Government may judge proper to confer upon him.

A Thousand Guineas subscribed by that number of persons, and their names published, would be of greater importance to the public; and of more credit to the subscribers than any additional honour or advantage to the person for whom that sum ought to be so raised.

TO DO INSERT ABOVE

The above letter, from a very intelligent correspondent, we have thought it our duty to insert; but ew must in candour say, that very serious objections seem to exist against that part of the plan which recommends any thing like display or parade in this affair:— every thing of that nature would be like exulting over the fallen, and would have a tendency to revive those turbulent feelings that are now gradually subsiding, we trust, for ever. Let the Country and the West Riding uphold their own character, by dispensing those rewards of honour or emolument on the persons whose courage and constancy tended in an eminent degree to restore public tranquility; but while we are performing these acts of justice, let us cautiously abstain from every measure calculated to reanimate the dying embers of discord.—EDITOR.

MR. EDITOR,—Sir, like your Correspondent VINDEX, of the 23d alt. I too am a votary of peace; and, like him too, entertain a hope that something may be done towards its restoration by a fair discussion of the unhappy differences which at present exist in this part of the country respecting the use of Machinery.

He begins by admitting the advantages of Machinery, *in general*, as a substitute for manual labour, and admitting this, I hope to make it appear that he must either confess himself guilty of inconsistency and an unfair attempt to pervert the course of argument from its straight road into the bye-path of his particular interest, or allow that it is equally desirable and equally advantageous to carry Machinery to the greatest possible perfection. Cropping by hand is universally allowed to be a most laborious employment; to crop by Machinery is done at a comparatively trifling expense of bodily exertion.— So far, therefore, it is productive of an effect which Mr. Vindex himself allows to be desirable; and at no time whatever can new Machinery of any kind be introduced, but it must follow as matter of necessity, that those persons formerly employed in that particular labour now destined to be performed by Machinery, must be thrown out of their usual occupation, and for a time feel that inconvenience which we should any of us feel on being compelled to a change of our early habits. But because general good is unavoidably attended with partial evil, shall we refuse to promote the general welfare? Shall we murmur at purchasing a lasting advantage at the expense of a temporary inconvenience? It is within the recollection of us all that the Cotton Trade has superseded the manufacture of Worsted Goods, and that in consequence the Makers and Buyers of the latter goods were subjected to great loss and inconvenience; yet they never rose up and said to this man, "You shall wear a pair of draw-boy breeches, or I'll shoot you;" or to that woman, "You shall wear a callimanco petticoat, or I'll break your windows." Their sufferings were the unavoidable effect of the progressive improvement of society in general, which who would wish to put a stop to? and they gradually surmounted them by turning their exertions into other channels, and yet I believe they have been subjected to greater inconvenience than the Croppers have experienced. Their branch of business was really extirpated; but the Cropper might have secured a continuance of employment to themselves if they had chosen; for I am informed that the Owners of Cropping Mills were willing, and even desirous to employ old Croppers in preference to men who had not been brought up to that business, and also to have employed their wives and children as burlers, &c. Their obstinacy, however, has compelled the Mill Owners to employ men who were entire strangers to the business, cad who are now earning from a guinea to 25s. weekly in their service—wages which are surely no plea for riot and insurrection.

Your correspondent further observes, that we have nothing to fear from the competition of foreign manufactures, as the advantages of price, quality, industry and skill, are decidedly on our side. So far as relates to *quality* and *skill*, I beg leave to call his assertion in question. It is well known that in France and Italy are manufactured cloths which in England cannot be equalled, and that all over the Continent they are rapidly improving in their Woollen Manufacture. Besides this, that unfortunate system which shuts us out of their markets, urges them on in the path of improvement; it will not do for us to defer the adoption of improvements until the return of peace—our rivals are employing the interval of warfare in the pursuit of every species of improvement, and we must do likewise, or we shall eventually find ourselves sadly behind hand. It is, therefore, only on the ground of being able to afford our goods at a lower price than they are manufactured for abroad, that we can hope to maintain our superiority in the foreign markets. Nor is it matter of indifference to the Merchant whether his cloth be dressed by Hand or Machinery, in as much as the dressing by Machinery is in itself greatly superior to the dressing by Hand. He, therefore, who opposes the improvement of Machinery, aims a fatal blow at the commercial interests of his country, since it is our Machinery alone which enables us to manufacture at a cheaper rate than our continental rivals.

I cannot, therefore, Mr. Editor, consider such improvements as furnishing the shadow of an apology for our present disturbances; nor do I think the plea of want of work, *in general*, offered with more truth. In that part of the country which I inhabit, there is, at least, no lack of employment; and if people chused to turn their hand to such as offers itself, I really think they need not be idle—but they must accommodate themselves to the changing circumstances of the times. If two men go to ask work at the same place and both persist in being gardeners, it is very probable they may not both find employment; but if one take the gardener's place and the other the groom's, they may both be employed. Or if by any accident, a weaver were to lose one of his legs, would it not be thought strange perverseness if, because he could no longer use his feet for earning his bread, he were obstinately to persist in refusing to learn to use his hands for that purpose? All this I know cannot be done without inconvenience; but any being capable of feeling and reflection, would rather, O surely! much rather, suffer inconvenience than incur guilt.

I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,  
Halifax, May 26, 1812. JUSTUS

TRIALS FOR TREASON.

FIRST DAY.— MONDAY, JUNE 9.

This day was fixed for the Trials of the State Prisoners confined in the Tower.

Last night the Guards were doubled at the Tower, and this morning orders were issued to prevent all strangers from entering the interior of the place. In consequence of this, the Yeomen of the Guard who were posted at the gate of the entrance leading to the bloody Tower, prevented all strangers from going that way.

At about 20 minutes after eight o'clock, Watson, Hooper, Preston, and Thistlewood, were brought from the Tower to Westminster Hall, in four glass coaches. In each coach were four Yeomen of the Guard, and one prisoner; and the whole procession was escorted by two troops of Life Guards. They passed over London Bridge. When they arrived in Palace-yard, the prisoners got out of their respective coaches, in the order in which we have mentioned their names, and were conducted, each between two Yeomen of the Guard, through a lane of Constables, to the wicket at the great entrance into the Hall.

On the gates of the Hall being opened, at a quarter after eight, it was discovered that a large and strong railing had been thrown across the hall from the Treasury steps, to prevent the pressure of the crowd and the interruption of the Law Officers in their passage to the Court.

At half-past eight o'clock, there was a tremendous crush at the doors of the Court, which was immediately followed by a grand entry of Barristers, who took their seats at the back part, reserving two clear benches for the Counsel on the part of the Crown and the prisoners.

At 20 minutes to nine o'clock, Mr. Watson was ushered into Court by a party of Yeomen of the Guard. He was dressed in a suit of black, and carried under his right arm a book; he bowed respectfully to the Court, and took his seat immediately behind the bar.

The Captain of the Yeomen or Gentleman Jailor, and the Lieutenant of the Tower, took their seats to the left of Watson. Preston was next ushered into Court, attended by another party of Yeomen of the Guard, he was also dressed in black; he appeared cheerful, and cordially shook hands with Watson: a party of Yeomen also escorted him. Hooper next made his appearance, and was dressed in black; he also shook hands with Watson and the rest. Thistlewood came in last; he looked ill: was dressed in a sailor's jacket and trowsers, and wore a black handkerchief. He manifested great anxiety to speak to Watson, and on his approach to him shook him heartily by the hand.—Sixteen Yeomen of the Guard sat by the side and behind the prisoners.

Before the proceedings commenced, the prisoners frequently conversed together. The Attorney-General elected to try the prisoners separately, and to take the case of Watson first.

A great number of Jurors were challenged both by the Counsel for the Crown, and also by the Counsel for the prisoner.

The following Gentlemen were then sworn of the Jury.

Thomas Allmack, Conduit street, bookseller.  
Robert Nocton, Temple-bar, button-maker.  
John Tomlinson, Covent.Garden, woollen-draper.  
P. Richardson. Charing-Cross, Lottery-office Keeper  
John Briant, Wapping-street, Anchor-smith.  
Samuel Kell. Red-Lion street, Holborn, carpenter.  
Richard Ramsden, Holborn, Capilaire-maker.  
William Phillips, Holborn, iron-monger.  
T. W. Barker, Hatton-garden, silversmith.  
Richard Perkins, Holborn, shoe-maker.  
William Hatblock, Shoreditch, currier.  
Samuel Knight, Norton-Falgate, druggist.

Proclamation was made in the usual way, as soon as the Jury was sworn, and then Mr. Barlow, the Officer of the Court, proceeded to read the Indictment Bill. After the-first count thereof was read,

Lord Ellenborough interposed and observed, that as all the other counts had annexed to them the same series of Overt Acts, he supposed that it would not be required by either party to have the whole of these repeatedly read over.

Mr. Wetherell, on the part of the prisoners, said, it could not be the wish of the Gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Copley) to cause the least unnecessary trouble or delay, but on the contrary their wish was to prevent both. The officer of the Court then by the consent of all sides, only recited the general counts, four in number, of the indictment, without repeating the overt acts.

Mr. Shepherd, the junior Counsel for the prosecution, then opened the pleadings; but signified, that after the time that was occupied in reading over the particulars of the charge, he would refrain from repeating it.

The Attorney-General then rose, and in a very long speech set forth the charges against the prisoners.- After he had concluded his speech on Monday, and evidence had been gone into, the Court ordered no part of the proceedings to be published during the trial.

SECOND DAY.

The prisoners were brought into Court with the same ceremony and solemnity as yesterday, and the Judges took their seats on the Bench precisely at nine o'clock. The first witness called, was

*Charles Shearman, Jun.* who was examined by the Solicitor-General. He deposed to the events in Spa-Fields, to the flag placed in the waggon, and to the speeches from that vehicle. On his cross-examination, he said, that he was twelve yards from the waggon, and heard no other part of the speech of a young man, but his invitation to jump down. To a question from the Court, he said, that only one person spoke while he was in the field, and he could not tell whether more than one individual jumped down, general as might be the invitation.

*Mr. Johne Stafford*, chief clerk at Bow-street, said, that on the 2d of December there was a great concourse of people at Spa-Fields; Mr. Hunt and others addressed the populace. He saw a flag displayed of three colours; green, white, and red. Inscribed upon it was, Nature, Justice, Truth, and some other words. A great many Police Officers were in attendance.

Lord Ellenborough observed, that it might be as well here to produce the flag itself, and the flag was accordingly exhibited by Mr. Hobler, Clerk of the Mayor's Court.

The witness resumed, after some further trifling particulars, that he saw all the people in the waggon in the act of jumping down. He endeavoured to break the pole to which one of the flags was attached, but was unable to do so; yet, he got the flag under his feet, when Limerick, the officer, assisted him. On his cross-examination, he deposed that all the assistants of the police officers were in attendance. He saw no soldiers in the field, nor did he know that any soldiers were in the vicinity.

*Limerick* was next examined to nearly the same particulars.

*Mr. Platt* proved the discharging a pistol at him in Mr. Beckwith's shop, under the circumstances already before the public, and during his examination it was attempted to be shown that the pistol went off while the witness was wrestling with the person by whom was supposed to be discharged.

*Sir J. Shaw* spoke to the seizure of the colours, &c. at the Royal Exchange. He thought it a very contemptible riot, which might easily have been suppressed.

*Mr. Hall*, the High Sheriff of the county of Middlesex, detailed what had occurred in the Minories. He only saw about 19 men with arms, and they were rather wantonly than viciously using them. He thought that about 20 soldiers might have put an end to the whole disturbance. He applied to the Tower for assistance, but in vain.

Several other witnesses spoke to the same effect. Some important papers taken upon the person of Watson, were rejected from the want of proper identification.

THIRD DAY.

This morning, the State prisoners arrived at Westminster at about a quarter past eight, and having been brought into Court, Watson was placed as usual in the front, and the others immediately behind him; they shook hands together, and appeared to be provided with refreshments, and were in high spirits; they were attended by sixteen Yeomen of the Guard. At half past eight, Mr. Justice Bailey took his seat on the Bench, for the purpose of disposing of several common motions, and at nine o'clock the Chief Justice and the other Judges entered the Court. At the same time the Attorney-General, Mr. Topping, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Richardson, and Mr. Shepherd, for the prosecution, came in; and when Mr. Wetherell, and Mr. Serjeant Copley, had taken their seats, the trial proceeded.

*Charles Mills*, of Terne's-court, Somers-Town, a patrole of Bow-street, was examined by the Solicitor General.

*John Castle* was afterwards examined, and his examination occupied the whole of the day.

At seven o'clock Lord Ellenborough asked the Counsel for the prisoners, whether they meant to proceed in the cross-examination, as the examination in chief was finished.

Mr. Wetherell said he was impressed with the necessity of asking the witness a few questions, at the same time that he felt the fatigue under which the Court and Jury must suffer, if he proceeded at length into the cross-examination of the witness. After so long examination as had already taken place, it could not be supposed that his examination of Castle could be short, he would proceed to the usual hour at which the Court adjourned, and resume in the morning.

The Attorney General objected to any suspension of the cross-examination. It was open to the Counsel for the prisoner either to proceed now or to-morrow.

Lord Ellenborough said, that the Court were prepared to hear him go on; but at the same time they were ready to accommodate the Counsel for the prisoner.

Mr. Wetherell submitted to the Court, that in a case so infinitely important they would direct that the witness Castle, who appeared, on the return of the list of witnesses to be in custody, should not be permitted to have communication directly or indirectly, with any person, previous to his cross-examination.

Lord Ellenborough did not see how the Court, with regard to precedent, could make such an order; but he thought Mr. Wetherell could best rely on the assurance of the Attorney-General.

The Attorney-General said, he was sure the Court would agree with him in thinking, that Mr Wetherell had asked no more than was right; and after hearing their Lordships' opinion, he felt it his duty to give a positive order, that the witness, Castle, shall not on any pretence have any communication whatever on the subject of the trial, till after his cross-examination.

After this, it was settled that the cross-examination should take place at the opening of the Court to morrow, and Mr. Wetherell said, he was afraid it would occupy a considerable time.

In the afternoon, while Mr. Gurney was examining Castle, Mr. Stafford brought into Court a considerable number of pieces of paper, with the following and various other inscriptions on them, "*Britons arise! No poverty in a plentiful Country!*" which he stated were circulating in great numbers throughout the Hall. They were immediately handed to the Attorney-General, who rose and addressed the Court immediately: "He should at all times be extremely sorry to interrupt the proceedings of the Court, but more particularly upon an important occasion, like the present; but seeing the Sheriff in Court, he hoped that Gentleman would excuse the liberty he took in suggesting that more than ordinary caution ought to be exerted in the Hall, to prevent the infraction of the public peace, when papers of the very dangerous tendency of those produced were in circulation.

On the swearing of the officers to keep the Jury from any communication, one of them observed, that if detained in the Court all day, and in seclusion all the evening, he feared the proceedings would be still further deferred by some of them being at length obliged to require medical assistance.

The Court felt their situation, and would endeavour to afford every convenience compatible with duty. It was better not to say more in Court. The officer attendant on the Jury was ordered to attend their Lordships in their Chamber.

The Sheriff now quitted the Court, and the proceedings of the day finished without any interruption.

The Tower yesterday received an additional reinforcement of 200 men from the brigade of guards. The whole are placed under the command of Lieut. Col. Cochrane, of the 3d guards.

The prisoners, on their return from the Court, the moment they entered the Hall, were received with loud huzzas from the surrounding multitude, which were repeated in Palace-yard, and continued to Westminster-bridge.

FOURTH DAY.

After Mr. Justice Holroyd had disposed of a great many common motions, the other Judges took their seats on the Bench, and at half-past nine Mr. Wetherell commenced his cross-examination of Cassels who was brought up in custody. His first interrogatories to this witness were to ascertain whether he had had any communication with any person, or person's, directly or indirectly, by writing, printing, or otherwise, upon the subject of his testimony yesterday: all of which interrogatories he answered in the negative.

The orders for the exclusion of strangers at the Tower during the time that the State Prisoners are there, continue to be enforced, and no person who is not well known is permitted to enter the interior of the garrison.

Several Members of Parliament, Sir Robert Wilson, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Hunt, &c. were in Court.

Every thing remained in perfect quietness in and about the Hall, and this day's proceedings finished at six o'clock. The prisoners were cheered on going back to the Tower.

Cambridge Chronicle and Journal - Friday 13 June 1817

LEEDS, SATURDAY JUNE 7.

Rumours of threatened insurrection have been circulated in this place, with great confidence, for some days past, and these reports rest on the authority of persons in official situations. The story, as it has reached us, is that delegates have of late held secret meetings in various parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, as well as in other parts of the kingdom, at which a general rising of the people has been determined upon for the purpose of overturning the Government, and Sunday or Monday next is mentioned as the appointed time for the breaking out of the rebellion. The report adds, that the Magistrates are to be seized as hostages, and that one of the objects of the insurgents is to liberate the State prisoners.

Since writing the paragraph, we received information on which we can rely, stating, that by the exertions of General Byng, 10 persons, supposed to he delegates, were yesterday apprehended at Thornhill-Lees, near Dewsbury, on suspicion of being concerned in treasonable and seditious practices. On the apprehension of the prisoners they were sent off to Wakefield in carriages, escorted by a detachment of cavalry: and so strong was the sensation produced in that place, that many hundreds of persons surrounded the Court-house, and pressed for admission. The examination took place before Sir Francis Lindley Weod, Bart., Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and other magistrates, and terminated in the committal of the prisoners for farther examination. In the mean time a dispatch has been sent by the Magistrates to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

The information relating to the time of the meeting and the objects contemplated by the delegates, was, we understand, furnished to the Civil and Military Authorities by one of their own number; and upon the same authority it was stated, that 50 stand of arms would be found concealed in a barn near the place of meeting. To ascertain the veracity of this assertion a person was dispatched to the place pointed out by the informer, but the sittings of the Magistrates, which were continued till between eight and nine o'clock last night, having broken up before the Messenger's return, we are unable to give his report.— *Leeds Mercury.*

FROM THE LEEDS INTELLIGENCER, Monday, JUNE 9

"We are not at liberty, nor would it be prudent, to divulge all the circumstances that have been ascertained; but the most perfect information of the state and disposition of all the seditious in this district, is in the hands of the Magistrates: and woe to them who shall hazard another attempt to disturb it. The wretches who have just been frustrated, have held secret meetings (as they thought) in the character of delegates in various parts of this county, as well as other quarters of the kingdoms; and had determined, in the madness of their hearts, on hoisting the signal for a general rebellion. Fools that they are! They saw not that they were drawing down inevitable destruction upon none but themselves! Of their supposed number (for we shall not say more till they have been mt upon their trial) 6 have been apprehended at Sheffield, and ten others were taken on Friday last, while they were assembled together, in a public-house at Thornhill Lees, near Dewsbury. Amongst these are James Mann, cloth-dresser, the Chairman of your late Leeds Union Club, for obtaining Parliamentary Reform, according to the Constitution; Thomas Murray, of Leeds, linenweaver, and John Smaller, of Horbury. They and their seven companions were immediately escorted to Wakefield by a detachment of cavalry, where they were examined before Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and other Magistrates.— After re-committing the prisoners for a second examination, a dispatch was sent off to the Secretary of State; from whom, probably, instructions will be received as to their present disposal.

"In the mean time, the Magistrates and Sir John Byng, the General commanding the District, have adopted the most effectual precautions for the preservation of the peace. In every quarter of the District, prudent arrangements have been entered into, In Leeds, a number of Special Constables have been sworn in. Two troops of the 13th Light Dragoons have been marched in from York, as an addition to the military force previously stationed here; and an increased force can be had at the shortest notice. Patroles of horse and of vigilantly traverse the streets during the night. That fine corps, which has received such distinguished praise from Sir John Byng, for its spirit, appearance, and discipline, the Northern Regiment of West Riding Yeomanry, assembled yesterday afternoon at Harewood, and other places, and are ready to act in any direction.

"As the plot is discovered, its explosion is for the present, no doubt, subdued. But vigilance and activity are not the less indispensable. Those who are well affected will now of course be more and more strongly impressed with the necessity of enrolling themselves in Volunteer Corps—not for the defence of Government, which is far beyond the reach of any danger,—but for the protection of themselves and their families and homes—the preservation of local tranquillity,—and the salvation of the deluded men themselves, who would rush into excesses, the end of which could be nothing but their own wretchedness and destruction. We have every reason to believe, that the Magistrates could readily obtain in this town and neighbourhood, the services of a sufficient number of individuals to form a corps of Volunteer Infantry."

"*Monday Morning, one o'clock.*—We stop the press to state that the whole of the cavalry are just mustered by the sound of a bugle. All we can learn is that they are to march in the direction of Wakefield immediately. We suspect that attempts are probably making to liberate the prisoners in that town. Excepting that stones have been thrown at some of the horse patrole, Leeds is yet perfectly tranquil."— *Leeds Intelligencer.*

THE MERCURY

The result of the trials for High Treason will do more towards removing discontent, allaying irritation, and tranquillising the public mind, than all the unconstitutional and coercive measures recommended by the present advisers of the Crown, or we should rather say, that this result will materially counteract the pernicious effects which these measures have a tendency to produce. The acquittal of obscure and unprotected men, against whom all the power of the Crown was arrayed, will afford a practical proof that there still exists in our Constitution a real barrier against oppression, which cannot be passed by the most despotic ministers. A proof, the cogency of which, the most ignorant and illiterate will be able fully to appreciate. It evinces that the trial by jury, which forms an integral part in the British Constitution, has not been deteriorated by those influences, which have, so essentially impaired the representative part of the system. We also rejoice in the acquittal of the state prisoners on another ground, because this solemn verdict of the jury will deter Ministers from instituting prosecutions for high treason on light and insufficient grounds, on the credit of such witnesses as CASTLE, or on the information of such incendiaries as OLIVER. It was the acquittal of Mr. HARDy, HORNE TOOKE, and their associates, in the year 1794, which preserved at that awful period, the ark of the Constitution from perishing on the rocks of anarchy, or of being swallowed up in the abyss of despotism. It was a period full of cruel inquietude and alarm, the liberties and lives of the people seemed in imminent danger of being sacrificed at the caprice of an overbearing administration, when the firm and upright conduct of a jury, presented its impenetrable shield between the accused and the accusers; though the indictment had in effect been found by both Houses of Parliament, and though every means possessed by the Crown, had been resorted to, to insure their conviction. The decision of the jury in the case to which we refer, operated almost like a charm; its effect was instantaneous; it at once restored confidence to the people, checked the vindictive proceedings of the Ministers of the Crown, and prevented that fatal catastrophe, which at that period seemed inevitable,

IN the House of Lords on Monday, LORD LIVERPOOL, in answer to the inquiries of EARL GREY, distinctly admitted that Mr. OLIVER was an agent employed by Ministers, for the purpose of detecting conspiracies; but it is now evident, from numerous facts, that this spy, finding no materials for his occupation in any existing plots, actively engaged in the fabrication of them, and that on the most extensive scale. This diabolical plot against the lives and liberties of his Majesty's subjects has already been the subject of investigation by the Magistracy of this Riding, the proceedings and result of which is a flattering confirmation of the accuracy of the statement we presented to the public on this subject. We trust that it will also become the subject of Parliamentary inquiry: the honour and dignity of Parliament, the safety of the country, and the character of the Executive Government, are deeply implicated in probing this matter to the bottom. Ministers, if innocent of any participation in this plot, ought most zealously to aid this investigation. To oppose inquiry, will be to involve themselves in the foul suspicions; for should it appear that Ministers have, we do not say participated in the plot, (for that would be the blackest treason) but even by their negligence connived at it ;— if, on the first intimation of the misconduct of their agent, they did not instantly recall him, and if, on proof of his guilt, they persist in protecting him, it will be the duty of Parliament to address the PRINCE REGENT, to remove these ministers for ever from his councils. This, indeed, on other grounds, would be a consummation most devoutly to be wished. The Secret Committee of the House of Commons have not yet made their Report, and it is suggested in the *Times*, that an investigation into the case of OLIVER ought to precede the delivery of their report. OLIVER himself will, no doubt, be called before the Committee, who Will probably find it their duty to hand him over to that confinement in which he has been the means of involving so many innocent men.

### WATSON'S TRIAL CONTINUED.

On Thursday, at half-past nine, the trial again re-commenced with the cross-examination of Castle, who was brought up in custody; the cross-examination continued till one o'clock, after which a number of witnesses were produced to speak to various circumstances;  this occupied the Court till half-past six, when the prisoners were again re-conveyed to the Tower.

On Friday, the examination of witnesses for the Crown was resumed, which continued till half-past twelve, when the Attorney-General declared he had closed his case.— Mr. Wetherell then commenced stating the prisoner's case, and did not terminate his address, until six o'clock in the evening. The Learned Counsel's speech was full of legal argument, and displayed the strongest powers of reasoning. He contended that, if the case of the prisoner were made out, it came within the provisions of the law for tumultuary riots, and not within the statutes of treason. It was impossible, he said, to bring it within the latter, without breaking down those great boundaries which marked out the distinctive classification of criminal offence. He also took an historical review of the different riots which took place for the last century, the tumults in the reign of Queen Anne and George I. Lord George Gordon's riots in 1780, and others, down to the late period of the Corn Bill and said, that, if the law of treason could have been at all applied, the Attorney-Generals of these times would lave called it into operation. At great length he combated the principle of constructive and interpretative treason. —At six o'clock the evidence for the prisoner was about to be entered into, which the Court adjourned.

On Saturday, Mr. Wetherell proceeded to call witnesses upon the first head of the defence, namely, the incredibility of John Castle's evidence. Mr. Hunt, the Spa-Fields orator, and Mr. Bryant, a solicitor, were examined on this head. Evidence was then tendered to shew Castle had been guilty of crimes of which he had never been convicted, but the Judges decided it could not be received.— At one o'clock Mr. Wetherell finished the evidence for the prisoner, and after their Lordships had taken some coffee, and Mr. Serjeant Copley had taken some necessary refreshment, he rose and addressed the Jury on the evidence on both sides. At the close of his speech, the prisoner declining to offer any thing to the Court himself, the Solicitor-General was occupied several hours in replying on behalf of the Crown, and the Court then adjourned till Monday.

The Court was crowded on each day during the week with persons of distinction; outside Westminster Hall there were numbers of people, who huzzaed the Prisoners, on their arrival and departure each day.— The Jury, in compliance with a wish expressed to that effect, were allowed to communicate with their friends, and to walk out for the air attended by the Sheriff's officers, that no one might have intercourse with them.

SEVENTH DAY.

MONDAY, JUNE 16. ACQUITTAL OF WATSON.

At twenty minutes past ten o'clock Lord Ellenborough proceeded to sum up the evidence to the Jury. His Lordship commenced by reading the precise form of the indictment against the prisoner, and explaining the four parts of which it was composed. He also laid down the ]aw of treason, and explained the precise bearings of the Statute of the 25th of Edward III. and the parts of this Statute which were applicable to the present case, namely, the compassing and imagining the death of the King and levying war against his authority. He did this not in any language of his own, but, as he expressed it, in the words of Lord Hale, Mr. Justice Foster, and some of the most eminent and best legal authorities, who were known in our country. By these eminent characters it had been laid down, that tumults which had merely a private object were not within the Statute of treason; but that those of a broader complexion, the breaking down fences and enclosures, and offences of that character, were within the law. The Learned Judge agreed with the Counsel for the prisoner, that the main question for the Jury was, whether the offences charged upon the prisoner were of the character of irregular and unprepared violence, or of a preconcerted and systematic plan. This was the main issue. Here he would observe, upon a remark of the Counsel for the prisoner, on the subject of the Law Officers of the Crown not calling either Harrison or Keans— why, it was evident that these men, if called, may demur to any question relative to their participation in this plot, yet the Counsel for the prisoner might have called them if they pleased, to shew the innocency of these transactions; for if they be innocent, then these witnesses would incur no responsibility, whereas, in the other vie, they must answer at their peril. The Learned Judge, with reference to the testimony of Castle, left it to the Jury to consider how far his testimony was confirmed by other evidence, and quoted the opinion of Lord Holt in favour of the admissibility of such testimony under certain circumstances.

The Learned Judge then read *seriatim* the whole of the evidence for the prosecution-becoming exhausted of towards three o'clock,

Mr. Justice Bayley continued to read the evidence to the Jury, and occasionally point out the parts in the detail in which the testimony of Castle was confirmed.

When the evidence was gone through—

Lord Ellenborough said he would only add a few observations to the Jury-great pains were taken (and praise-worthy ones for their client) by the Counsel for the prisoner, to nullify the testimony of Cassels.- The Crown were bound to furnish a list of witnesses to the prisoner, who was not bound to deliver the same list to the prosecutor; it might then possibly happen that if the Crown had the same opportunity of investigating the characters of those who exposed the immoral life of their witness, the same stigma might perhaps attach to those who made such a statement. It appeared, however, that the prisoner and his associates continued in intercourse with Cassels, from the 15th of November to the 2nd of December, notwithstanding his infamous toast at Hunt's, which ought to have at once compelled them to discard him for ever. But the important confirmatory parts for the Jury to consider were the taking Mr. Cosser's house, the pipe making by Bentley, and other matters of less, but not unimportant notice. The Learned Judge reverted at considerable length to the serious character of the evidence, and concluded by entreating that the Jury would give in such a verdict as would quiet their own consciences, protect the prisoner, and give him immunity from punishment if he deserved not to be visited by it; while they would, at the same time, feel that they were protecting the laws of the land, and giving them, and those who administer them, effective security.

The Jury now proposed to withdraw, and an officer a (Mr. Beaumont) was sworn to take them in charge during their deliberation.

*Lord Ellenborough* then intimated to the Jury that they might have refreshment in the box before they retired; afterward, until their verdict was given in, or they could not expect to receive any.

*Mr. Justice Abbot* suggested to them to have some tea or coffee.

Some of the Jury wished for sandwiches and wine and water and in a few minutes after manifested an anxiety to retire and consider their verdict without waiting for refreshment.

*Lord Ellenborough* told them not to be in a hurry; the Court would very readily wait. Officers soon after escorted them out of Court to their room. Most of the barristers in the front seats, after the retirement of the Jury, stood up, as did Mr. Watson, folding his arms. Afterwards, he wrote a note to Mr. Harmer, his solicitor, then conversed with Mr. Wetherell. who was on the floor of the Court, and received Mr. Harmer's answer.

The Officer, to whose care the Jury were committed, took the following oath:—

"You shall well and truly keep this Jury without meat, drink, or fire—you shall suffer no person whatever to speak to them, nor you yourself, unless it be to ask them whether they are agreed, or not."

Before the return of the Jury, great huzzaing and clapping of hands were heard in the Hall. Much surprise was apparent in Court. Lord Ellenborough said the Hall ought to be cleared, and Mr. Sheriff Kirby went out, as if for that purpose, but quiet was presently restored, and it was found, that the applause had been given to the Lord Mayor, on his passage through the Hall.

At 20 minutes before seven, having been out an hour and 49 minutes, they returned into Court, and their names being called over,

Mr. Stirling, Clerk of the Crown Office, put the question— Gentlemen of the Jury, by whom do you pronounce your verdict? By the mouth of your Foreman?

The answer was given in the affirmative.

Mr. Stirling— Gentlemen, how say you? Is the Prisoner, James Watson, guilty or not guilty of the offence of High Treason with which he is charged?

Mr. Richardson- NOT GUILTY.

Mr. Stirling—You say he is Not Guilty; that is your verdict; and so say you all. Gentlemen, how say you, is he guilty of flying from justice?

Mr Richardson— Not guilty, my Lord.

Mr. Stirling— You say the Prisoner is not guilty; this is your verdict; and so say you all.

A Barrister, drawing aside the green curtain, instantly called out towards the Hall —"Acquitted." He was heard only by a small part of the company, but their plaudits immediately made it known to the others, and were re-echoed from all parts of the Hall. The intelligence spread rapidly through Palace-yard and the adjoining streets. It was impossible to walk in the neighbourhood without hearing the words a hundred times in five minutes.

Lord Ellenborough looked round this Court, as if his Lordship, in the first moments of the impression made by the verdict, seemed to think the plaudits proceeded from a part of the audience there; but his Lordship soon perceived that the utmost decorum prevailed within its doors.

As soon as silence was obtained, Mr. Watson asked permission to say a few words. One or two gentlemen near him intimated, that as his Counsel, Mr. Wetherall, had withdrawn, this might not be proper, but the Court appeared willing to hear him. Mr. Watson, bowing respectfully to the Jury, said, "Gentlemen, I thank you much."

*Lord Ellenborough* asked the Attorney-General if he had any other charge against the prisoner? The Attorney-General answered, "No, my Lord."

Mr. Watson was then discharged; but, as the plaudits continued in the Hall, Lord Ellenborough expressed a wish that the Jury should wait a little time before they withdrew; and Mr. Watson, appearing to feel that the reason of the request might extend to him, also remained in Court. When he withdrew it was through the vaulted passage, which leads to Old Palace-yard, whence he passed with Mr. Harmer to Millbank.

In the mean time, the carriage, which had been drawn up near the door of the Hall to convey Mr. Watson back to the Tower, if that had been permitted by the verdict, was removed, and the Home Guards who attended it, retired.

In Spring Gardens Mr. Harmer and Mr. Watson were recognized and cheered.

COURT OF KING'S BENCH, TUESDAY.

Up to an advanced period of this morning it was supposed that the proceedings already instituted against the remaining State Prisoners would be carried on to trials, and a Jury were summoned yesterday, who remained in Court all this morning under that expectation.

At one o'clock Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper and Thomas Preston, were brought into Court, amidst the loudest acclamations, and placed at the bar, under the care of the Yeoman of the Guard, as usual. They were all dressed in black. At twenty minutes before one the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General had entered the Court, when the following Jury were impannelled—

John Franklin, John Hunter, John Kemp, Alex Chapp, George Barber, Charles Hewitt, John Rose, Robert Hartley, Joseph Smith, William Fell, William Gurdler Muthlow, and Wm. Cleghorn.

The Attorney-General then addressed the Court as follows:—

"May it please your Lordships,

"It becomes my duty to inform the Court, that it is not my intention to call any witnesses to support the charge against the prisoners."

Lord Ellenborough—"Gentlemen of the Jury— as no evidence is offered by his Majesty's Attorney-General against the prisoners, it becomes your duty to find them Not Guilty."

Clerk of the Court —"Gentlemen, are Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper, and Thomas Preston, found guilty of the Treason whereof they stand indicted, or not guilty?"

Foreman of the Jury.-"Not Guilty."

Clerk of the Court.—"How say you, did they fly from justice?"

Foreman of the Jury.—"No."

Lord Ellenborough—"Mr. Attorney General, have you any further charge against the prisoners?"

The Attorney-General—"I have no other charge My Lord."

Lord Ellenborough—"You say you have no further charge—therefore I shall order then forthwith to be discharged."

Mr. Harmer now conducted the prisoners out of the Court the back way behind the Bench, under the Piazzas of the House of Lords. An immense concourse of people were waiting in Palace-yard, in expectation that they would come out that way, but one or two persons recognized them under the Piazzas, and immediately, by their shouts, made known heir discovery to those in front of Westminster Hall.

Huddersfield June 4, 1812  
DEAR SIR,— The Luddites continue very active in stealing fire-arms in the neighbourhood, not a night passes but we hear of them prowling in great numbers, throwing the peaceable inhabitants into the utmost consternation, demanding their fire-arms, and threatening them with instant death on refusal.

Yours most respectfully.

ARMS STEALING.

The system of violence, intimidation and outrage, familiarly and too well known by the cant name of *Luddism*, which has so long afflicted and disgraced this district, has of late assumed a new aspect, and diverged into a still more menacing and alarming species of depredation—that of obtaining_fire-arms in the night, from the houses of individuals, by force and intimidation. Of the prevalence of this alarming species of midnight-robbery, we have several instances to lay before our readers, On Wednesday se'nnight a number of persons, about seven or eight, undisguised, went about midnight to the house of Mr. Thomas Milnes, Storrs-Hill, Horbury, and having roused him from his sleep, demanded entrance. Mr. Milnes not appearing inclined to obey this mandate, they threatened if he did not instantly open the door, they would immediately force it. Mr. Milnes finding he could make no availing resistance to their demand, gave them admittance— They then insisted upon having his fire-arms; but on being satisfied that he had none, they demanded money and refreshment; he gave them some silver, and bread, cheese and beer. They then requested that he would allow them to take some to some poor fellows who they said were watching at a distance; with this requisition he thought it also prudent to comply, and they then civilly took their leave of him. On Sunday night these depredators made a further attack on several houses at Netherton, (a place in the immediate vicinity of Horbury) where they succeeded in obtaining seven or eight stand of arms; and upon this occasion they behaved with peculiar atrocity, by wantonly firing several musket balls into one of the houses. The success of these nocturnal depredators on this occasion is the more remarkable, as on the day before, (Saturday) the Chief Constable of the District, and the Constable of Horbury, had received directions to receive the fire-arms of such of the inhabitants as were disposed to give them up, and which they carried into effect the same day, most of the inhabitants readily giving up their arms to the custody of the Civil Magistrates, but some few refused. The Constables were much hooted and abused by the populace whilst they were executing this duty, and one of the mob had the effrontery to take from his pocket a handful of musket balls which he threw into the air, exclaiming "Here are hail-stones for you." It is said there is a person in Horbury employed in casting these leaden messengers of death. Every article of lead, such as pumps and water-spouts, &c. which can be readily conveyed away, are constantly disappearing. The glaring violation of the laws of society and of private property, evinced in the nocturnal visits of these burglarious plunderers, though of itself an evil of the greatest magnitude, is, as it were, lost in the contemplation of those more atrocious purposes for which these instruments of death are collected, and which the imagination almost sickens at the thought of. It is probable that these plunderers may deceive themselves with the notion, that as they do not actually break into the houses, their offence is not a capital one; but they ought to know, that to obtain property of any kind by threats of violence, is an offence equally penal, and will subject them to the punishment of death.

On Thursday se'nnight, the shed, adjoining the barn of Mr. Robert Waltshaw. of Horbury, was maliciously set on fire, but was fortunately discovered in time to prevent its communicating to the barn. It is not known whether this was the act of a solitary incendiary, or a branch of that horrible system referred to in the preceding paragraph.

PROJECTED INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE

In the second edition of our last publication, we stated some particulars, which had just reached us, of a rumoured insurrection in this district, and also the arrest of ten persons near Dewsbury, on a charge of treasonable practices. We shall now proceed to lay before our readers all the information which we have been able to collect upon the subject, and our researches have been conducted with great diligence, with perfect impartiality, and with the most anxious wish to come at the truth. We shall first shortly state what appears to have been the object and extent of the plot, and then detail those circumstances which either attended its development, or which have subsequently occurred. It appears, that almost immediately after the suppression of the Union Societies, established in different towns in this district for effecting a reform in Parliament, some of the most violent members associated together, in a private and clandestine manner. At these meetings it is supposed to have become a question for deliberation, whether a change in the representation might not be effected without the intervention of Parliament, and a project to effect this purpose appears to have been communicated to them by Mr. Oliver, who had been introduced to these Ultra Reformers by Mitchell, (a Delegate, now in custody,) as a person deserving their confidence, and not only disposed to communicate to them interesting information as to the state of the country; but able to afford them the most affectual assistance; thus recommended, he soon possessed himself of their unbound confidence. This person is said to have represented to these credulous men, that all the people in the metropolis were favourable to a complete change of Government, that every thing was organised, and that it was absolutely settled, that on the night preceding the trial of the state prisoners, (the night of the 8th June,) a general rising, would take place; that as a consequence of this movement, all the public offices were to be taken possession of, all the constituted authorities seized, and the state prisoners released; and that a plan had also been arranged for securing all the military, by which means a change in the government would be effected, without any effusion blood. It was further represented to them, that in order to carry out this bloodless revolution, it was absolutely necessary that the same plan should be simultaneously acted upon in all parts of the country;- that it was therefore necessary, that on the night agreed upon, namely on Sunday the 8th inst. all the military in every district of the kingdom should be secured in their quarters, their arms seized, and that the magistrates and other civil officers should be arrested and placed in a state of restraint, not merely that no opposition might be made to the designs of the insurgents, but that they might serve as hostages for the safety of such of their own party as might fall into the hands of government. This absurd and wicked project is said to have been entertained, and in some degree acted upon, by a number of individuals in different parts of this district; and a participation in this plot is alleged against the persons who were apprehended yesterday se'nnight, at Thornill Lees, charged with having assembled there, for the purpose of carrying into immediate effect this daring and traitorous project. Our readers will probably infer, from this statement, that the person introduced by Mitchell to the Ultra Reformers, was, in truth, a spy, and that every step taken towards the execution of the project, had been communicated to persons in authority, as the plot appears to have been known by some of the Magistrates for several weeks past. On Friday morning last, several of the Delegates, together with the informer, met at a public house, in this town, and proceeded in the direction of Dewsbury, and from thence to Thornhill Lees, where they had no sooner arrived at the house of rendezvous than they were surrounded by a detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, and taken into custody. The following is a correct list of the names and places of residence of the persons apprehended:

John Smaller, shoemaker, Horbury, near Wakefield.  
Thomas Murray, Flax-Weaver, Leeds.  
James Mann, Cloth-Dresser, Leeds.  
Thomas Wood, Clothier, Westgate Common, Wakefield.  
Michael Waller, a Publican, and formerly keeper of the Yew-Tree, Robert-Town.
Miles Illingworth, Carpenter, Manningham, near Bradford.  
Benjamin Whitley. Cloth-Dresser, Holmfirth.  
Edward Fletcher, Card-Maker, High-Town.  
Joseph Midgley, Clothier, Almondbury.  
Wm. Walker, Clothier, Thornhill, near Dewsbury.

The prisoners were immediately conveyed in carriages, escorted by the Yeomanry Cavalry, to Wakefield, and lodged in the Court-House, where they were examined for several hours by Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry Esq., and other magistrates there assembled. The examination was private; some circumstances have, however, transpired, which we shall state. It was asserted by one of the witnesses examined, that in a barn at Whitley, near the place of meeting, there were deposited one hundred pikes, and 50 stand of fire arms; it was further stated by the same witness, that in the house of John Smaller, of Horbury, would be found a quantity of ball cartridges. Messengers were instantly dispatched to search both these places, and it is important to state, that, on removing the straw in the barn, not a single pike or fire arm could be discovered, and it was the opinion of the persons who searched the premises, that the straw had not been disturbed for a considerable time. That part of the evidence which related to the ball cartridges was also falsified, nothing of the kind having been found in the house of Smaller. We have introduced the result of these important searches in this place, though, in the order of the narrative, it ought to have been introduced somewhat later. The Court-House at Wakefield, was surrounded by an immense assemblage of persons during the whole of the examination. About eight o'clock the prisoners were remanded until Monday, to the House of Correction, for further examination. They were escorted by the cavalry, who were dismounted, the escort was attacked by the populace with stones, brick-bats, &c. thrown with great violence. The prisoners were, however, safely lodged tn the House of Correction.

On Saturday, the succeeding day, two troops of the 13th regiment of Light Dragoons arrived in this town, from York, and that day and Sunday passed over without the slightest indication of insubordination, though not without alarm; for about midnight on Sunday, the town was thrown into the greatest consternation by the bugle sounding for the Cavalry, who remained on duty at he Court-House all night, in consequence of some alarming reports which had reached the magistrates, (who were also at the Court-House,) of an intention to rescue the prisoners at Wakefield. An express was immediately sent there to call out the Yeomanry Cavalry, who instantly assembled and continued on duty all day. No attempts at release were made, and the day passed over at Wakefield in tranquillity. We regret, however, to state, that an attempt was made in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to assassinate one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, about one o'clock on Monday morning, by firing a loaded pistol, the ball of which lodged in the forehead of the horse belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Huddersfield, but the ball has been extracted, and the horse is likely to recover. We understand that an outrage of a similar nature, was committed the same night, at Ossett, a village near Dewsbury, where the house of a member of the Yeomanry Cavalry was beset by a number of persons who demanded his arms, and on his refusal to give them up, fired several shots into the house. Five persons have been apprehended at Huddersfield, and its neighbourhood, on a charge of being concerned in the former of these daring outrages.— They have since been committed to York Castle, on a charge of malicious firing: they passed through this place yesterday afternoon, accompanied by an escort of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry.

The following is a list of their names and residence:

Abram Oldham, and John Oldham, of Honley.  
Isaac Johnson, and Joshua Knowles, of Holmfirth.  
John Rhodes, (late of Holbeck), Holmfirth.  

The re-examination of the prisoners charged with High Treason, took place at the House of Correction, in Wakefield, on Monday, where the Magistrates were holding a special Session for enquiring into the state of that gaol. The number of gentlemen on the Commission who attended on this occasion was uncommonly great, among others, were Sir F. L. Wood, Bart. Rev. W. R. Hay, (Chairman of the Manchester Sessions,) Rev. Wm. Wood, Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and Benj Haigh Allen, Esq., Wm. Prest, Esq. the Mayor of this borough, was also present. This examination was, in the strictest sense, private, as no person, except the Magistrates, was suffered to remain in the room during the discussion of this subject. The prisoners were merely examined *pro forma*; they were brought into the room separately, and informed that their further examination was deferred until the following Monday, until which time they were re-committed. No witnesses were examined affecting the prisoners, and the meeting might rather be termed a Committee of inquiry, than a meeting of Justices for the judicial examination of prisoners. It may be presumed from this unusually long adjournment of the examination, that no evidence has yet been given against the prisoners which can warrant their committal for High Treason, and it is reasonable the re-committal has been with the view of detaining them until instructions can be received from government as to their ultimate disposal. We understand that some important papers have been found in the House of James Mann, the Leeds Delegate. In using the term *delegate*, we do not mean to insinuate that these persons have been elected by any body of men whatever; there is no evidence of any such delegation, and the probability is, that they represent nobody but themselves. We think it right to make this remark, lest it should be supposed that they were delegated by the places where they appear to be resident, which would have given a very formidable aspect to this plot, and a degree of importance to which it is by no means entitled. The conspiracy appears to have been confined to a relatively small number of persons, and was of a nature which the laws of the country afforded ample means to suppress. It appears also to have been of a very recent date, and to have originated in the injudicious, and we will add, unconstitutional measures adopted by Ministers to seek the expression of the public feeling relative to a Reform in Parliament. It must be further remembered, that the account we have given of the plot must be considered in the nature of an *ex-parte* statement, and must rest for its credibility, very considerably, on the reliance which can be placed on the witnesses, who do not come before the public in a light which entitle them to much credit, and whose evidence has been materially broken in upon, by circumstances stated in the above account. It must be further recollected, that all the persons apprehended are of the lowest class of society, illiterate, and ill-informed, and liable to be the dupes of designing men. The great mass of the people are, we are convinced, free from any knowledge or concurrence in the plot. In short, when the whole is dispassionately considered, there appears no ground for that excessive panic and alarm which the first announcement of the plot produced, much less does afford any legitimate ground for a renewed suspension of the Constitutional rights of the people.

We feel great satisfaction in having to state that the most perfect tranquillity has prevailed here during the whole of the past week, and that the alarm by which the announcement of so many plots had produced, has nearly subsided.

SECOND EDITION

Since the first edition of our paper was prepared for the press, the highly important fact has been communicated to us, from a respectable quarter, that the plot referred to in the above statement has been got up under the instigation of an agent from London, and that the principal offender has been suffered to escape with impunity. In confirmation of this fact, which was communicated to us at a late hour yesterday afternoon, we were referred to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, in Dewsbury. To develop a transaction so important, not only to the Government and the people of this country in general, but so intimately connected with the liberty and lives of the accused, we felt it to be our imperious duty to repair to Dewsbury, without a moment's delay, and there to ascertain, on the spot, the truth of the allegation.

As a precautionary measure, we drove to the house of one of the first merchant-manufacturers in the town, and Mr. Willans be sent for, he suggested, that in order to render the investigation complete, Mr. John Dickinson, a linen-draper in that place, should be invited to attend. This suggestion being adopted, Mr. Dickinson also attended, and the following is the result of our investigations into the mysterious transactions which formed the subject of our inquiry:—

Mr Willans stated, and the truth of his assertions his is willing to confirm by his solemn affirmation, that, about two months ago, a person of the name of *Oliver*, called upon him, and introduced himself as a Parliamentary Reformer, sent form London, to ascertain the dispositions of the people in the country. This man he describes as a person of genteel appearance and good address, nearly six feet high, of erect figure, light hair, red and rather large whiskers, and a full face a little pitted with the small-pox. His usual dress, he says, was a light fashionable coloured brown coat, black waistcoat, dark blue mixture pantaloons, and Wellington boots. The description of such a character is important, and may form a clue to further discoveries, connected with his proceedings in other parts of the country.

Mr. Oliver, he says, called upon him several times after his first introduction, and in one of his subsequent calls, said, that as it was quite obvious that Government would not listen to the petitions of the people, it had now become necessary that they should be compelled to attend to their demands. These insinuations Mr. Willans silenced by the observation, that he could not engage in any proceeding that implied the use of force, or the shedding of human blood. On another occasion, Mr. Oliver told him, that he (Oliver) was one of a committee of five that effected the escape of young Watson, and that if Thistlewood had had equally prudent counsels, he would also have escaped. In fact, the whole tenor of Oliver's conversation went to show that he had traitorous designs, and that he was in league with traitors.

Such conversation, as might be supposed, awaked Mr. Willans's suspicions, and the intercourse between them had almost ceased, when, on Friday morning last, the day the ten persons were arrested at Thornhill Lees near Dewsbury, he again called at Mr. Willan's shop between 10 and 11 o'clock, and Mr. W. being absent on business, he begged that his wife would tell him, that a meeting of delegates was to be held on that day, at Thornhill, and earnestly requested that she would use her influence to prevail upon her husband to attend. Before Oliver quitted Dewsbury to attend the meeting, he called again at the shop, when he found Mr. Willans had returned. He accordingly renewed his solicitations to Mr. W. to attend the meeting, telling him at the same time, that "*his friends in London "were almost heart-broken that the people in the country were so quiet.*" At the same time he informed him, that he had walked over from Leeds that morning, and two persons supposed to be Leeds men, appeared in his train. Unmoved by Oliver's solicitations, Mr. Willans persisted in his resolution not to attend the meeting, and owing to his obstinacy, Dewsbury was prevented from swelling the number of *deputies*, so called.

At the appointed time, the meeting was held at Thornhill Lees, and the toils being set, eleven deputies, Mr. Oliver being of the number, were taken by a detachment of cavalry, and all except Mr. Oliver, who had the *good fortune* to be liberated, were conveyed to Wakefield in custody.

While the examinations were proceeding at the Court-House, Mr. Oliver had repaired to his quarters, which were at the Strafford-Arms, that is, the head inn in Wakefield. Here, to his great consternation and confusion, he was recognized by Mr. John Dickinson, who had seen him at Dewsbury, and had heard that he was a leading man at the private meetings. Advancing up to Oliver, Mr. Dickinson addressed him, and the following conversation took place:

*Mr. Dickinson.* How does it happen, Mr. Oliver, that you, who appear to have taken so leading a part in the meetings, are at liberty, while your associates are likely to be sent in custody to London?

*Mr. Oliver.* No papers were found upon me, and being a *stranger*, the persons who apprehended us were obliged to set me at liberty.

These observations were made in a very hurried manner, and Mr. Oliver withdrew to take a seat in the Wakefield coach to Leeds.

As soon as Mr. Oliver had placed himself in the coach, a servant in livery stepped up to him, and, moving his hat, entered into conversation with him.

This circumstance, combined with the extraordinary reasons that Oliver had given for his liberation, induced Mr. Dickinson to inquire of the servant, after the coach had left the inn, if he knew that Gentleman? to which the servant replied, that he had seen him at Campsall, and he had driven him a few days before in his master's tandem from that place to the Red-house to meet the coach. On receiving this information, Mr. Dickinson enquired who his master was? to which the servant replied, General Byng. He then left him, and asked Mr. Tyler, who keeps the Strafford Arms, if he knew Oliver? to which Mr. Tyler replied, that he had been there several times — that he believed he was form London — and that several London letters had come directed to him at that inn.

From every thing we have heard of the character and conduct of General Byng, we are persuaded that he has been merely the medium for receiving Oliver's information, and that whoever may have employed this double-distilled traitor, the General has acted merely in the discharge of his official duty. But every circumstance we have just related, proves, that somebody has employed him, and the question is— who were his employers?

What the trade of this man may be, we cannot pretend to say—but that he is a *Green Bag Maker* by profession is, we think, sufficiently obvious. Why such a wretch, the main spring and master-piece of the conspiracy, by which the country has been thrown into its present state of alarm and agitation, was suffered to escape, while the poor unfortunate victims of his machinations are held in confinement, is more than we can say; but the subject requires deep and grave investigation, and we call upon the magistrates of this riding, now that we have given them the clue, to go to the bottom of this nefarious transaction.

We ask this boon from them in support of their own character— we ask it from a regard to the character of the country— we ask it from a regard to the Government— we ask it in justice to the advocates of Parliamentary Reform— and above all, we conjure them to enter into this inquiry, from a regard to all the families and the lives of the men at present in confinement, on the information of this prototype of Lucifer, whose distinguishing characteristic it is, first to tempt and then to destroy.

We have been favoured with the following extract of a letter received yesterday from Nottingham, by a Mercantile house in this town :-

"*Nottingham, June 12th, 1817.*

An insurrection was fully expected by the Magistrates to have begun here on the 9th inst. We remained, however, perfectly quiet; but on the 10th, a great number of persons out of Derbyshire, armed with pikes and guns, which they stole on their route, approached this place: they advanced as far as Eastwood (8 miles distant) where they were encountered by Mr. Rolleston, a very active county Magistrate, supported by a troop of dragoons, when they immediately fled in all directions, leaving about 26 of their number prisoners, who were conducted forthwith to the County gaol; one person was shot dead by the *insurgents* for not delivering up his arms when required, and another was shot by accident; these, we believe, are all the casualties that have occurred. We are perfectly quiet at present, and the Magistrates are very active. We hope, therefore, that there is an end of the business."

The neighbourhood of Huddersfield was thrown into consternation on Sunday night, by an attack made about 12 o'clock, on six of the horse-patrole, at Folly-Hall Bridge, near that place, by a number of men with arms. A volley was fired, and one of the horses struck on the head, by a ball, which has since been extracted. The patrole finding their number too small to attack their adversaries, retired after a shot had been fired by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was wounded; and by the time the main body with the infantry reached the place, the whole of the assailants had dispersed.

...

The Secret Committee of the House of Commons, which is expected to recommend the continued Suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act, was appointed on Thursday. It differs only from, the former Committee in the substitution of the present Solicitor-General for the late Attorney-General. ...

IN the House of Lords on Monday, LORD LIVERPOOL, in answer to the inquiries of EARL GREY, distinctly admitted that MR. OLIVER was an agent employed by Ministers, for the purpose of detecting conspiracies; but it is now evident, from numerous facts, that this spy, finding no materials for his occupation in any existing plots, actively engaged in the fabrication of them, and that on the most extensive scale. This diabolical plot against the lives and liberties of his Majesty's subjects has already been the subject of investigation by the Magistracy of this Riding, the proceedings and result of which is a flattering confirmation of the accuracy of the statement we presented to the public on this subject. We trust that it will also become the subject of Parliamentary inquiry: the honour and dignity of Parliament, the safety of the country, and the character of the Executive Government, are deeply implicated in probing this matter to the bottom. Ministers, if innocent of any participation in this plot, ought most zealously to aid this investigation. To oppose inquiry will be to involve themselves in the foul suspicions; for should it appear that Ministers have, we do not say participated in the plot, (for that would be the blackest treason) but even by their negligence connived at it ;-if, on the first intimation of the misconduct of their agent, they did not instantly recall him, and if, on proof of his guilt, they persist in protecting him, it will be the duty of Parliament to address the PRINCE REGENT, to remove these ministers for ever from his councils. This, indeed, on other grounds, would be a consummation most devoutly to be wished. The Secret Committee of the House of Commons have not yet made their Report, and it is suggested in the *Times*, that an investigation into the case of OLIVER ought to precede the delivery of their report. OLIVER himself will, no doubt, be called before the Committee, who will probably find it their duty to hand him over to that confinement in which he has been the means of insolving so many innocent men.

### EXPLODED PLOTS.

The inquisition made in our last paper of the plotters against the public tranquility, has produced a sensation in the Metropolis – the Senate – and the nation at large, that has seldom been exceeded. One of its first effects was to procure the liberation of the principal part of the persons charged with holding a political meeting for treasonable purposes, at Thornill Lees, in this county; and the magistrates of the West Riding, with a proper regard to their own characters and to the public interest, have done themselves lasting honour, by setting at liberty the men, whom a perfidious conspirator, acting under a superior agency, had marked out for his victims. By this exposure, the secret springs of a diabolical conspiracy, not of the people, but against the people, have been laid bare. The real conspirators have been exhibited to public view.

The nature and the objects of the plots have been disclosed, and all the trepidation and alarm with which the public had been seized, have given way to an universally felt indignation against the alarmists and their emissaries. The effect has been almost magical. The blow aimed at the friends to reform, has been made, by a retributive recoil, to fall upon the heads of their adversaries, and every man with an English heart in his bosom, whatever his party or his political predilections, feels himself insulted and outraged by the attempts made to convert the most populous and important part of the kingdom into a scene of conspiracies, and his countrymen into a nation of traitors.

The account published in the second edition of our last paper, and which will be found in the parliamentary proceedings of the present week, has proved to be in every important particular correct. From that account it appeared — that the Yorkshire Plot was *got up* by a political agent of the name of Oliver, from London— that this man, under the guise of an ardent zeal for the cause of Parliamentary Reform, did not hesitate to suggest to Mr. Willans, a bookseller, at Dewsbury, the propriety and necessity of resorting to force for the purpose of compelling Government to grant that by coercion, which they were disinclined to concede to petitions. That, on the day when the meeting  at Thornhill was appointed to be held, he endeavoured, by the most urgent entreaties, to prevail upon Mr. Willans to attend that meeting, and that in the course of conversation, he told Mr. W. that "his" Mr. Oliver's "friends in London were almost heart-broken that the people in the country were so quiet." Who Mr. Oliver's friends, or at least his employers, are, the Earl of Liverpool has, with great candour, informed the country; but why they should be so much disquieted at the tranquility of the people, we shall not pretend to conjecture. It further appeared, from the statement above referred to, that Mr. Willans refused to attend the meeting at Thornhill, and that Dewsbury was thereby deprived of a *deputy*. Whatever might be the disinclination of Mr. Willans to attend the meeting, Mr. Oliver, it seems, was not actuated by the same motives — he attended— was taken into custody along with ten other delegates, and was suffered to escape "because he was a stranger, and had no papers about him." The next appearance of this stranger was at Wakefield, on the day and at the moment when the persons apprehended with him were under examination before the magistrates at that place, and there it was discovered by a singular train of incidents, that a few days before the meeting at Thornhill, Oliver was at the house of General Sir John Byng, the commander of the district, and that he was conveyed in the General's tandem to meet the coach, which bore him to the scene of his delinquencies. This discovery, so fortunate for the country, will be considered as a special interposition of a Superintending Power, in favour of the country; and we may say with truth, "the finger of Providence was there."

On this part of the exposure a few observations will suffice. Every link of the chain of evidence is perfect. The conduct of Oliver, the informer, admits of no further disguise-it is perfectly clear that he instigated persons to attend at Thornhill, on the day in question, and there is reason to suppose that he himself appointed the meeting. What were his instructions we cannot say, but he is completely identified with men in an official situation, by a species of evidence that scarcely stood in need of the admission made by Lord Liverpool, that he was an agent of Government. But, says his Lordship, the account in the Leeds Mercury is an *ex parte* statement, and as such must not be implicitly relied upon. That is true, my Lord, and our anxiety is, that it should no longer be *ex parte*. We invite your Lordship to deprive it of this character, by a rigorous investigation into all the facts of the case; and this investigation, we beseech your Lordship and your colleagues to institute, before the Suspension Bill, founded upon these alleged conspiracies, is suffered to advance another stage in its progress. Whether the bill to renew to Ministers the power of exercising a despotic control over the liberties of their countrymen, has produced the plots, or the plots have produced the bill, it is not our present business to inquire; but we feel it our duty to say, as a circumstance coming within our own knowledge, that, in the inquiries which we made at Dewsbury, the day before the facts we have developed were laid before for the public, we never recollect to have heard a witness give his evidence, even in a court of justice, and upon oath, with a more scrupulous regard to truth than Mr. Willans. If he erred, as he certainly did, in suffering a traitor like Oliver to come near his house, after he had, by insinuation, communicated his villainous designs, he has made ample reparation to his country for his error, by having first declined to attend a meeting, the object of which he considered to be mischievous, and then, by making those disclosures, even at the risk of the obloquy to which they were sure to subject him, which have tended to put down a system of *espionage*, contemplating first the seduction of his Majesty's subjects from their allegiance, and then the destruction of the seduced and the extinction of public liberty. Mr. Dickinson's evidence, which was given with the utmost frankness, Lord Liverpool has confirmed, by the acknowledgement that Oliver was an agent of Government, and in that capacity, it seems, was in communication with the commander of the district.

Mr. Oliver, the political incendiary, made his first appearance in Yorkshire about nine or ten weeks ago, accompanied by one Mitchell, a Liverpool *delegate*, (now in custody) under the assumed character of a zealous Parliamentary Reformer, whose object it was to ascertain the dispositions of the people, and to give to the sluggish current of public feeling a due degree of fervour. On his arrival in Wakefield, by the True Briton Coach, he called upon Mr. Benjamin Scholes, a publican in that place, a person who had taken a leading part in a meeting recently held, for the purpose of petitioning the Legislature, for a Reform in the representation of the people, and as a specimen of the manner in which Mr. Oliver executed his mission, we shall state the substance of a deposition made by Mr. Scholes, before J. P. Heywood, Esq. one of the magistrates of this riding:—

TESTIMONY OF MR. SCHOLES.

On his first interview with Mr. Scholes, Oliver said, that he was charged to present Sir Francis Burdett's compliments to him, and to inform him that he was delegated by the Baronet, Lord Cochrane, Major Cartwright, Mr. Hunt, and other gentlemen, to examine into the state of the country, and to learn whether the country meant to sit down with their petitions being rejected or not. Mr. Scholes said, he could not speak for others, but for himself he must say, that though he believed he was among the most zealous of the Parliamentary Reformers in Wakefield, he would go as far as petitioning went, but no further. Some conversation then took place on the subject of the Wakefield petition, on which Oliver observed, that "it was very good, but it did not go far enough." Mr Scholes replied that they did not mean to interfere any further, and he referred Mr. Oliver, for information as to the views of the reformers, to Mr. Hurst, the printer of the Wakefield Journal, Mr. Dealtry, at one of the West Riding Magistrates, Mr. Egremont, a gentleman of independent fortune in the neighbourhood, and other gentlemen, who had signed the petition. Mr. Scholes cannot say whether Oliver applied to these gentlemen, but in point of fact we believe he did not. His dupes were to be found among the distressed and the ignorant, and it was to those principally that he addressed himself. Oliver then requested Mr. Scholes to furnish him with the names of such persons, in the neighbouring villages, as were favourable to Reform, which he did, and, amongst others, he mentioned John Smaller, of Horbury. Having thus far felt his way, Oliver next proposed to Mr. Scholes that he should accompany him to Manchester and Liverpool, on his political mission, and promised that he would both pay his expenses, and satisfy him for his trouble. This proposal Mr. Scholes declined. Some time after Oliver again called at Mr. Scholes's, and proposed a walk into the country, to examine the newly erected asylum, stating that he had some skill in architecture. During their walk the subject of Parliamentary Reform was resumed, and Oliver observed that Sir Francis Burdett and the other gentlemen by whom he was delegated were astonished that the country was not more alive to the subject of Parliamentary Reform. "I asked him," says Mr. Scholes, "what he meant by being alive," and he replied, "*if petitioning will not do, we must use physical force*." "Physical force," rejoined Mr. Scholes, indignantly, "the country must not be thrown into a state of insubordination, and I will have nothing to do with plunging the country into anarchy." Thus repulsed, Mr. Oliver dropped the conversation. The third and last time that Mr. Oliver called upon Mr. Scholes, it was for the purpose of inviting him to attend a meeting which Oliver said he had appointed, at Penistone, in this Riding, for discussing a plan of Parliamentary Reform. This meeting Mr. Scholes positively refused to attend, telling Oliver, at the same time, that he believed he was a bad man, and that he would not only not attend this meeting himself, but he would also dissuade any other persons, over that whom he might have any influence, from attending it. He further asked him his reason for staying so long in this part of the country, as he must be satisfied that his project of resorting to force would not be encouraged. Oliver replied, that he did not dare to return to London till the State Trials were over, and, on being asked the cause of his fears, he said he had assisted young Watson in effecting his escape. In this conversation Oliver expressed himself dissatisfied with the apathy of the country, in proof of proof of which, he said he had appointed two meetings at Huddersfield, and when he got there not a single individual had attended. At parting, Mr. Scholes said and to Oliver, "Now. Sir, I beg, that from this time, you will never call upon me again." In the course of the evening, several men, who were drinking in Mr. Scholes's house, told him that Oliver had appointed a meeting at Penistone the next day, and asked him his opinion of Oliver and his measures; to which he replied, "for God's Sake keep from Oliver and his meetings, for he is a base villain."

From the period of the Penistone meeting, which, we believe, was held on the 1st of June, till the eve of the Thornhill meeting on the 6th of June, we have no specific information respecting the operations of Mr. Oliver, but we understand, that a little before the time of the former meeting, this incendiary made a journey to London, and that, in the interval, he was travelling about in the counties of Nottingham, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Lancashire, labouring, no doubt, in his vocation. For the honour of human nature, we hope that the use made by Mr. Oliver of the names of Sir Francis Burdett, Major Cartwright, and others, was not authorized by Ministers; but after such a specimen of the vile arts employed to traduce the friends of Parliamentary Reform, we are not in future to be surprised at any calumnies that may be propagated against them.

We have already stated, from the testimony of Mr. Willans and Mr. Dickinson, how Mr. Oliver was engaged in some parts of the day on Friday, the 6th of June, and the grateful feelings of one of the persons discharged by the Magistrates on Monday, has afforded us a clue to his proceedings in the early as well as the more interesting parts of the same day. Last Tuesday morning, a person of the name of Thomas Murray, one of the Leeds *delegates*, so called, waited upon us, to express his acknowledgments, and the thanks of the persons who had been imprisoned with him in Wakefield House of Correction, for the services which they conceived we had rendered to them, in contributing to their liberation, by exposing the real conspirators. After he had explained his business, we inquired how it happened that he had attended the meeting at Thornhill, and what was the nature of his delegation? To this he replied that he would explain the whole matter, as far as he was acquainted with the business, and the following narrative, which was delivered in the most artless manner, he is ready, we understand, to confirm upon oath:—

TESTIMONY OF THOMAS MURRAY.

THOMAS MURRAY is a linen-weaver, in the employment of Messrs. Benyon, Benyon, and Bage, of this place, and says, that on Friday morning, the 6th of June, about half-past seven o'clock, he was standing near his master's works in Meadow-lane, near the junction of the two roads from Leeds to Dewsbury, to along with a young man of the name of Thomas Dovner, when a person with the appearance of a gentleman, answering to the description given of Mr. Oliver not in the second edition of the Leeds Mercury of last Saturday, walked up to them and inquired the road to Dewsbury. On the road being pointed out to him, he inquired how much further Thornhill was than Dewsbury, and was told two miles. He then asked Murray if he was out of employment? and on being told that he was for that day, owing to the woman who assisted him in his business being obliged to remain at home to attend to her family; Oliver observed that he had some business at Thornhill, and being an *entire stranger* in that part of the country, he should be glad if he would accompany him and show him the way, for which services he would reward him, by paying his expenses, and satisfying him for his day's work. After some persuasions Murray was prevailed upon to go, and on their way to Dewsbury they regaled themselves at the public-house at Stump-Cross with a shillings'-worth of rum and milk, for which Oliver paid. During the journey the subject of politics was never introduced but once, and then Oliver informed his guide, that "Mr. Abbot was elevated to the Peerage, and he was glad of it, for he was an impartial clever little fellow." On their arrival at Dewsbury, Oliver went into a small bookseller's shop, (Mr. Willans's) and requested his guide to wait for him at the door. When he came out, he said, the person he wished to see was not in, and they then went into an adjoining public-house, where they again refreshed themselves at Mr. Oliver's expense. While they were in the house a woman came in, which Murray believes was Mr. Willans's wife, and said, that her husband had come in, on which Oliver immediately followed her into the bookseller's shop, and in the space of about a quarter of an hour returned. Murray and he then proceeded on their way to Thornhill, and when they had arrived in a lane about one hundred yards from the Sportsman's Arms, they saw three gentlemen, one of them being Major-General Sir John Byng, riding up to meet them at full speed. On their approach, Sir John advanced up to Oliver, and pointing with his finger, said, "I think I know you, Sir." Oliver, affecting to be overcome with fright, made no reply. Sir John then said, "I have had an accurate description of to you from London! Sir, is not your name Oliver?" Oliver still remained silent, and by the orders of Sir John he was surrounded by a party of cavalry and taken into custody. Sir John then called to another detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, who were on the road, to stop Murray, which they did, and after driving him into the ditch, they dragged him into the Sportsman's Arms public-house. Here they searched the person of the Leeds *Delegate*, but found not a single scrap of paper upon him. At that time there were about five or six persons in the room all in custody, and he learned that they had all been picked up in different parts of the neighbourhood. When they had been in the public-house about half an hour, several post chaises, which seem to have been previously prepared, drove up to the door, and in them they were conveyed, under an escort of Yeomanry Cavalry, to the Court-house at Wakefield. From the time that Murray was apprehended, up to the period of his discharge, he never saw Oliver but once, and then he was brought into the room at the Sportsman's Arms in custody, but he had not remained there above half minute, when he was called out of the room by Sir John Byng, and never again appeared. After the examination at Wakefield, Murray and his fellow *delegates*, not one of whom, to the best of his knowledge, he had ever before seen, were committed to the House of Correction, and were there kept for eleven days in solitary confinement, and on the prison allowance.

Such are the statements that we have received from the mouths of the persons whose names they bear. That they are in all their leading particulars correct, we have not the slightest doubt. They are published with the honest intention of tranquillizintg the public mind, of justifying the innocent, and of exposing the guilty. Had we consulted either our own ease, or our personal safety, we should have shrunk, in times like these, from the responsibility of this exposure, but there is a feeling of the mind paramount to all these considerations— a sense of public duty, and by that principle alone we have been actuated.

The same spirit of candid inquiry and love of truth, which has, we hope, displayed itself in every part of our conduct in these mysterious transactions, induces us to present our readers with the following letter addressed to the Editor of this paper, and received yesterday morning, from Major General Sir John Byng, the commander of the district.

LETTER OF GENERAL BYNG.

"St. James's Square, (London) June 18th, 1817.  
"Sir,-You have introduced my name into your last paper in such a manner as to induce me to desire the insertion, in your next, of the following statement:-

"You have suffered it to be inferred, that a person of the name of Oliver, was employed by me— that he entrapped the persons taken up at Thornhill-Leys, and that he left London with the view of exciting and fomenting discontent and disturbance in different parts of the country. Not one word of this is true:— before Oliver left London, information had been transmitted tome, from Nottingham, of an intended rising in the manufacturing in the North of England and Scotland: this information was only a repetition of what I had reason to expect for several weeks, if the notion of Sir Francis Burdett, for a Reform in Parliament, should be rejected. The information from Nottingham was subsequently corroborated so fully to me from various quarters, and the 9th of June being from all fixed upon as the period of rising, I was induced, on Monday the 2d of June, to wait upon Sir Francis Wood, and communicate to him what I knew, who deemed my information of sufficient importance to propose a meeting of the Magistracy at Barnsley, for Friday, the 6th. On Wednesday, the 4th, I, for the first time, saw or heard from Oliver, who gave me some information corroborative of that I had before received, and further told me that there would be a meeting of delegates at Cleckheaton on Friday, the 6th. Mr. Parker communicated, on the 5th., to Sir Francis Wood and myself, that he had at Sheffield information given, upon oath, that a meeting of persons, who were finally to decide upon the plan for the 9th, would be held at the Sportsman's Arms, at Thornhill Lees, at 11, on Friday the 6th, and suggested the propriety of arresting these delegates, to prevent the fatal consequences which might ensue on the 9th:— this suggestion was agreed to at Barnsley, on the morning of the 6th. When the Magistrate' (Mr. Chandler) and myself arrived at Thornhill, although some time after the hour of the proposed meeting, Oliver was not come, having been deceived as to the place of the meeting, which, as I have before stated, he expected was to be at Cleckheaton, and so far from having entrapped the men arrested, he only knew one of them by name, (which, in fairness to the individual, I will not here insert). He neither knew the real place of meeting, nor the persons assembled, and was consequently not brought before the magistrates to confirm their other evidence.

"With respect to the alleged conversation with Mr. Dickenson and Mr. Willan, I cannot speak, as I confine myself to facts; but I have to remark, that what  is imputed to Oliver by them, is a direct contradiction to what he stated as his general line of conduct, and is quite contrary to what he considered his instructions, which were confined solely to give any Magistrate, or myself, information necessary for preserving the peace of the country.

"It only remains for me to add, that I am not empowered to hire any person— that I have never, directly or indirectly, paid any thing for the information I have received, which has hitherto been communicated to me from respectable authority, and from a far better motive than any mercenary consideration.

"I am, Sir,  
"Your humble Servant,  
"JOHN BYNG, Major-General."  
To Mr. Edward Baines, at the Mercury-Office, Leeds."

In justice to ourselves, it is proper to remark, that in our paper of last week, we stated facts, rather than drew inferences, and that not one of those facts has been shaken by the above letter. We did not say that "Oliver was employed by General Byng to entrap the persons taken up at Thornhill Lees." On the contrary, we said, that "from every thing we has heard of the character and conduct of General Byng, we were persuaded that he had been merely the medium for receiving Oliver's information, and that whoever might have employed him, the General had merely acted in the discharge of his official duty." Nor did we state that Oliver "left London with the view of exciting and fomenting disturbances in different parts of the country." We could not dive into the dark recesses of Oliver's mind, and it was as impossible for us to know with what views he left London, as it must be for General Byng to speak to the same fact. But with whatever views he left London, or whatever might be the nature of the instructions he received from Ministers on his departure, we think that, after the exposure which it has fallen to our lot to make of his nefarious practices, both General Byng and the country must now be convinced, that this profligate informer has excited and fomented disturbances in different parts of the country, and in the words of the Wakefield Journal, "that had there been no Mr. Oliver there would have been no plot." That there is a great mass of dissatisfaction in the country, and that rumours of the nature alluded to in General Byng's letters, will continue to prevail as long as the public distress prevails, cannot be doubted; but that there was any concerted plan for a rising of the people, till Mr. Oliver and his co-adjutors came into the country, and injected their treasons into the minds of the people, would, we apprehend, be very difficult to prove. Even with Mr. Oliver's assistance, the meeting at Thornhill, if a meeting it could be called, was a most pitiful assembly, and General Byng, we are convinced, when he saw the materials of which that meeting was composed, must have perceived, that all apprehensions of the West Riding of Yorkshire being three days afterwards thrown into a state of insurrection, were utterly groundless. When the General uses the word *delegates*, he must, we presume, apply it in the popular and not in the correct acceptation of the term. It is our firm conviction, that not a single individual present, Mr. Oliver alone excepted, was clothed with delegated powers. The narrative of Thomas Murray, given above, proves very clearly what sort of delegation he possessed; and from every thing we can learn, we are persuaded, that the other delegates just as much represented the places where they happened to reside, as Thomas Murray represented the town of Leeds. General Byng's mode of accounting for Oliver's late attendance at the meeting, is proved by the testimony of Murray to be incorrect, (unintentionally so, no doubt.) We find this man in Leeds, twelve miles only from the place of meeting at half-past, seven o'clock in the morning of Friday, the 6th of June, inquiring, not for *Cleckheaton*, but for *Dewsbury* and *Thornhill*; and we find also, from the concurrent testimony of Mr. Willans and Thomas Murray, that the principal cause of his late attendance was, his wish to seduce Mr. Willans to attend that meeting, to which he had, by a different artifice, decoyed Thomas Murray. General Byng's disavowal of the possession of any powers to hire persons to give him information, we do not call in question, though we do not perceive the propriety of making such a disclaimer, when the conduct of a confessedly *hired* spy is under discussion. It is a matter of perfect indifference to the public, whether Mr. Oliver's remuneration stands under the head of "Secret Service Money" or of "Army Estimates."

The observation of Lord Liverpool, that Mr. Oliver was sent by Government to discover, and not to form plots, may be true, but a first Minister of State ought to know, that when a spy cannot find a plot, he will make one; and when he knows that his employers have a *Green Bag* to fill, he will not fail to present them with his well-timed contributions. But Lord Liverpool, in some of the reports of his speech, says, that if Oliver has practised the arts alleged against him, and endeavoured to excite the people to treasonable acts, he has exceeded his instructions. In that case, let him be brought to justice. Overt acts of treason have been committed, and Mr. Oliver, an avowed agent of Ministers, has perpetrated the crime. Either the agent or the principals are guilty. If he be not tried, they ought to be impeached. Impartial justice, and the loudly raised voice of the country, demands it; and it is the duty of Parliament to see that so reasonable a demand is satisfied.

...

EXAMINATION AT WAKEFIELD

On Monday, a numerous meeting of the Magistrates of the West-Riding was held in the Sessions Room at the House of Correction, Wakefield, for the purpose of investigating the cases of the persons recently apprehended at Thornhill-Lees, on a charge of treasonable practices; present, the Right Hon. Earl Fitzwilliam (Lord-Lieutenant), in the Chair; Sir Francis Linley Wood, Bart. Rev. Wm. Wood, Clerk, J. P. Heywood, Benj. Dealtry, Godfrey Higgins, Hugh Parker, Michael Stocks, Thomas Horton, Thomas Benyon, and Wm. Bairstow, Esqrs. Wm. Prest, Esq. Mayor of Leeds, was also present. The numerous attendance of the Magistracy on this occasion, was, we have reason to believe, produced by the exposure in our last publication of the diabolical and treasonable machinations of Oliver, the Government Spy. The examination was private — a circumstance which we regret, because it will prevent us from giving that full account of the investigation which we were desirous to present to the country, and which would, we are persuaded, have tended essentially to tranquillize the public mind.

After the examination of William Bradley of Sheffield, on whose information the prisoners had been committed, Mr. John Dickinson, of Dewsbury, was called in and examined touching the circumstances of Oliver's conduct. This gentleman's examination occupied nearly two hours, in the course of which, we understand, he confirmed, upon oath, the circumstances detailed in the Second Edition of our last Paper, and Earl Fitzwilliam, the Lord-Lieutenant, took down the evidence with great minuteness.

Mr. James Willan, the bookseller, was next called, and expressed his readiness to state his evidence, relative to the attempts made by Oliver to seduce him from his allegiance, on his solemn affirmation, but this being a criminal case, the affirmation of a Quaker is not admissible, and he was obliged to withdraw without giving his evidence.

The examination of the witnesses continued several hours, and the Magistrates, after deliberating some time on the evidence, directed that

Thomas Murray, of Leeds, Michael Walker of Robert-Town, Miles Illingworth of Manningham, Edward Fletcher of High-Town, Joseph Midgley of Almondbury, & William Walker of Thornhill should be discharged on their own recognizances.

Thomas Wood, of Westgate-Common, Wakefield, was also discharged, on finding bail, himself in £40, and two sureties in £20 each.

Benjamin Whitley, of Holmfirth, was remanded until Friday, when he was told that he would be discharged on the same terms as Thomas Wood, if no  further charge was preferred against him.

And John Smaller, of Horbury, and James Mann, of Leeds, were then brought up and discharged; but were immediately taken into custody by a King's Messenger, under a warrant signed by Lord Sidmouth, and were sent off the same evening in a post chaise to London, accompanied for a short distance by a small escort of cavalry. The warrant for the apprehension of these unfortunate men is, we understand, founded on the information of the informer Oliver.

It is impossible to describe the general satisfaction which the investigation of this day produced. The discharge of the state prisoners was justly considered as a disavowal on the part of the highly respectable magistracy assembled, of any serious plot against the Government of the country, and the impression made upon the mind of the Lord Lieutenant will, we hope, have a salutary influence in another place.

TO THE EDITOR of the LEEDS MERCURY.

Sir— The insertion of the following in your paper will much oblige, Your obedient Servant, JOHN DICKINSON.

TO Mr. GRIFFITH WRIGHT.  
SIR— My astonishment would have been greatly excited by the article in your paper of the 16th inst. but coming from the quarter it does, it only serves to confirm my opinion both of the Editor and the paper.

If you would permit truth to appear, it would never have been stated, that on my being closely questioned it came out that my name was Dickinson. as I introduced myself by name nearly in the first moment of our interview, and had never the least idea of concealing it; as to the promise of calling again, it was only conditional, viz, if my friends in Leeds should approve of my taking the responsibility upon myself.

This is my statement, and the public will decide between us; and as my only wish was to develop the truth, I could not, neither did I expect any thing like a candour in the conduct of one always ready to support the worst measures which can be adopted for this country, and to abuse all who will not tamely bow their necks to the yoke of despotism.

Mr Spedding, the Constable of Dewsbury, has readily signed his name to the following:

'I hereby certify that John Dickinson. of Dewsbury, had full authority from me to use my name in the advertising of Oliver in the Leeds Intelligencer of the 16th of June, 1817.

'THOMAS SPEDDING, Constable of Dewsbury.'

SUMMER CIRCUITS.

REPORT of the COMMITTEE of SECRECY.

*Further Suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act.*

In the House of Lords, on Thursday the 12th inst. the *Earl of Harrowby* presented a Report from the Committee of Secrecy, which was read by the Reading Clerk at the table. The Report began by stating, that the Committee had taken into their serious consideration the papers referred to in the Prince Regent's Message, and they felt it their duty to state, that it appeared from the evidence before them, that the practices, meetings, and combinations, alluded to in their former Report, still continued in various parts of the country, having for their object the overthrow of the Constitution and Government, and the destruction of the established system of order and tranquillity. The evidence upon which they founded their opinion, was in part derived from persons implicated in these transactions, and from individuals who had participated in them, with the view of making communications on the subject to the Magistrates or to the Secretary of State. With respect to these latter persons, the Committee thought it right to state that in some instances they had urged on other individuals to acts of violence, instead of merely watching what these individuals did. Making, however, every allowance for the exaggerations which had thus risen, the Committee had evidence before them, of the accuracy of which there was no doubt, that disaffection to a considerable extent prevailed in the manufacturing districts in the northern parts of the kingdom. It was undoubtedly true, that in some of these districts there existed considerable distress; but it was equally true, that the distress of which actually existed must be considered the instrument rather than the cause of disaffection, it being the fact, that in many places were the pressure was most grievous, the people evinced the greatest loyalty, patience, and good order. -The Committee had found since the last Report, the practices at Manchester had been continued, and that a meeting was summoned to be held there on the 3d of March, which was numerously attended, and at which the most inflammatory language was used. It was proposed and agreed to at this meeting, to hold another meeting on to the 10th of March, and it was recommended that ten out of every twenty assembled on the latter day, should be in readiness to proceed to London, for the pretended purpose of presenting a petition to the Prince Regent, with which view they were to provide themselves with blankets, shoes, &c. The meeting was held, and attended by from 10 to 12.000 persons, notwithstanding several of the ringleaders had been previously arrested, and the project of proceeding to London was attempted to be carried into effect, but the deluded individuals were stopped through the activity of the Magistrates at different short distances, and compelled to retrace their steps. It appeared it was held oat to them that they would be joined on the road by large bodies from different towns, so that by the time they advanced towards London they would be 100,000. The grossest delusions were, in fact, held out to persons assembled upon that occasion, nor could the project itself be considered in any other light than as directed against the public tranquillity, which must necessarily have been considerably endangered by the attempt of a considerable body of men to advance in the manner proposed to London.— After this period, it appeared that the additional power entrusted to the Government had some effect, and that numerous meetings were not attempted to be held, but secret meetings were assembled in remote places; and though some societies were broken up, and some public houses would not receive them, they contrived to assemble in other houses in a lonely situation. At some of these meetings the most undisguised language was used; it was no longer Parliamentary Reform that was held up as a pretext, but Revolution was openly advocated; the individuals attempted to be influenced were called upon to provide arms (though the committee had been unable to trace any arrangement made for the actual procuring of arms), and it was even held out that persons in office, and others obnoxious to them, ought to be got rid of. A general rising was contemplated early in April, but from some circumstances it was put off till June. In the mean time, numerous meetings, in consequence of the additional power placed in the hands of Government, not being deemed advisable, a system of delegation was established, and persons calling themselves delegates assembled at different places. It was held out, that it would not be advisable to commit much to writing, and that the names of the leaders should be as much as possible concealed. These persons calling themselves delegates, repeatedly assembled, and kept up an extensive correspondence. An assembly of these delegates was held at a town in Yorkshire, early in May, at which it was determined that a general rising should take place on the 10th of June. Nottingham was to be the head quarters of the insurgents. They were to obtain arms by plundering the barracks and other depots, and to march in a large body to London. It appeared that the conspirators had even gone the length of contemplating the destruction of Manchester, for the purpose of adding to the discontent, by throwing a great number of persons out of employ. The signal was to be given by a rocket being fired; upon which the manufactories and other buildings were to be destroyed. The project was frustrated by the activity of the Magistrates, and it appeared that the project of the general uprising had also been frustrated; but there were some districts in which the parties had determined on rising, notwithstanding the determination of this meeting of delegates; and the evidence before the Committee upon this subject had been confirmed by the recent appearance of bodies of men in arms at a the precise period which is stated to have been fixed upon, an particularly in one of the districts, which had latterly been represented as determined to act without waiting for a general insurrection. The Committee, in taking this view of certain parts of the country, which was unfortunately too well supported by the evidence and documents before them, felt it their duty to state, that in other quarters there was a general feeling of loyalty and attachment to the Government; and that, even in the disturbed districts, the greater part of the people were loyally attached to the Government. The Magistrates had displayed the greatest activity in frustrating the projects of the disaffected, and they were powerfully aided by the loyal support of the population. The Magistrates, however, were of opinion, that the most effectual means of putting down the disaffected, and frustrating their projects, had risen out of the additional powers placed in the hands of Government: and the Committee were of opinion, upon the whole view of the case, that, in order to frustrate effectually the projects of disaffection, it was absolutely necessary to continue the additional powers vested in the hands of Government, the ordinary laws being insufficient for the purpose.— The Report was laid on the table, and ordered to be printed.

### OLIVER THE SPY.-

A fact has come to our knowledge connected with the mission of this arch traitor, which, though it can be communicated in a few words, speaks volumes to the mind of every British subject. On the first arrival of Mr. Oliver in the neighbourhood of *Sheffield*, where he spread terror among the peaceable and well-disposed part of the inhabitants, and by his flattering representations imparted joy and confidence to the disaffected and evil-minded, the vigilance of the magistrates at that place enabled them to trace out his proceedings, and to discover that he was disseminating the poison of his treasons in every direction. The first use made by the magistrates of this discovery was to apprise the conservators of the public peace in other parts of the riding of the arrival of this incendiary, and their next step was to address a letter to the Secretary of State for the home department informing him that a *London Delegate*, a man apparently above the lower ranks, had arrived in the country, and was actively employed in organizing sedition and exciting the people to acts of treason. This letter was written by Hugh Parker, Esq. the senior magistrate of the district, who, by return of post, received an answer from Lord Sidmouth, informing him that the person he described as so dangerous a character was an *Agent of Government !!!* Indignant at this communication, Mr. Parker's first determination was to withdraw his name from the commission of the peace, but his repugnance to shrink from his duty at time of public exigency overcame his detestation of the system which ministers had adopted, and he was prevailed upon to continue those services which have reflected so much honour on his own character, and so much benefit on the country. When Lord Sidmouth's *long promised* statement regarding the employment given by government to a herd of spies and informers makes its appearance, we hope he will indulge the public with the correspondence which passed between his lordship and the Sheffield magistracy. We should be glad too if the Magistrates would publish the examinations taken before the Lord-Lieutenant at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th. ult. If we are rightly informed, those examinations confirm every material point of the statement regarding Mr. Oliver, made in this paper two days before; and it has been stated distinctly in the House of Commons, that the *only material called for the crown* on that occasion, swore that Mr. Oliver got up, or prepared the whole plot. We beg to direct the attention of our readers to the speech of Mr Bennett on the third reading of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and we should be glad if some Member of the House would move, in his place, for the production of Bradley's evidence.

On this subject Lord Castlereagh has dauntlessly declared that government do employ spies, and has represented them as necessary to the safety of the state. Under an administration such as that formed by his lordship and his co-adjutors this may be the case, but *good* ministers, like *good* princes, require no spies, and the words of Montesquieu, whose skill in the science of politics would not suffer by a comparison with any of the present ministers individually, or with the whole of them collectively, has said:— "Should I be asked whether there is any necessity for spies in monarchies, my answer would be, that the usual practice of good princes is not to employ them. The trade of a spy might perhaps be tolerable were it practised by honest men, but the *necessary* infamy of the person is sufficient to make us judge of the infamy of the thing."

It has been insinuated, that in making the exposure we have exhibited to the public, we have been influenced by factious motives, and that our object has been merely to annoy the servants of the Crown, and to advance the interests of a party. Supposing this to be the case, the motives would not disprove the facts. But we claim the merit of higher influence. That we have our party predilections we are free to confess, but we have much more regard for our country than for our party. It has been stated that we are ultra-reformers, or as the phrase in the *Sun** Newspaper is "reformers of the modern school." This assertion we deny, and we appeal to facts for the veracity of our disclaimer. It is known by every man who has read our sentiments on Parliamentary Reform, as published in this paper, that without presuming to condemn the advocates of universal suffrage and annual parliaments, we have never been the supporter of those measures. It is known too, that at the meeting held in this town for the purpose of voting a Petition to the Legislature on the subject of Parliamentary Reform, we steadfastly and successfully opposed the introduction of a motion for assembling adjourned meetings, maintaining that they had the appearance of holding out a menace to government. It is also known, that when the practice prevailed last year of sending out political missionaries, for the purpose of inculcating the principles of Parliamentary Reform, we openly and perseveringly condemned the policy, and exposed the impropriety of such a proceeding, and it was probably owing to this cause that we never had the honour of a call from MR. OLIVER. It is further known, that we supported to the best of our power the benevolent views of those who, during the past year of general distress, exerted themselves to relieve the labouring classes by providing them food at a reasonable price; and that we pointedly condemned the censure cast upon institutions established for that purpose; but it, is not known, perhaps, though it is nevertheless true, that we never were connected at any time with any political society whatever. In making these statements, we must repeat that we are not to be understood as conveying any censure towards. those who have pursued a different course on any or all the points we have mentioned; we merely state the facts to show that we are neither ultra-reformers nor the slaves of any party. On every subject we act on the decision of our own unbiased opinion, honestly formed, and we claim therefore the credit of having made the exposure of MR. OLIVER, and the spy system, purely on public and patriotic grounds.

We have the satisfaction to conclude this article, by stating a fact, that will be hailed with pleasure by every real friend to social order: Since Mr. Oliver left Yorkshire, perfect tranquility has been restored. The County was never more peaceable. The 13th light dragoons, who had been brought into the West Riding, under an apprehension of an insurrectionary rising, have returned to their quarters at York, and the nightly military patrole has been discontinued. In a word, we are as tranquil now the spies have disappeared, as we were before they came amongst us. The exciting cause has been withdrawn, and the effect has ceased.

### ORIGIN OF THE LATE CONSPIRACIES.

Several attempts have been made, both in and out of Parliament, to prove that Mr Oliver was merely a *passive* agent in the late conspiracies, formed against Government in the North of England; and that he neither excited the popular discontent, nor gave vitality and organization to the conspiracies. — That this representation of the conduct of the "ministerial agent" is false and deceptive, we have already proved by a host of witnesses. But it is said that these witnesses have all acted under the influence of a disposition to traduce the character of Mr. Legh Keck's *immaculate builder*, and that therefore their evidence is not to be relied upon. This conclusion, we think, does not arise by any means out of the premises. There may, however, be those who are of a different opinion, and to such we beg leave to shoW, out of the mouth of a *Government witness*, that Mr. Oliver was the "Great Man";— that under his directions the *delegates*, so called, were appointed— that he moved and controlled every thing, and that he was, in a word, "the foreman of the concern."

At the examination held at Wakefield on Monday, the 16th of June, before the Lord-Lieutenant, and a full bench of Magistrates, to inquire into the conduct of the ten prisoners apprehended at Thornhill-Lees on Friday, the 6th ult. on a charge of holding a treasonable meeting, a witness, whose name we are not at liberty to mention, was produced for the Crown, and against the prisoners. This witness, who was represented by the accusers to be of unimpeached character, and free from all suspicion, deposed, amongst other matters:—

"That he had seen Oliver twice. That he, Oliver, was considered by all the parties as the *great man* to communicate and direct things from London. That as *he* directed so *they* acted. That the appointment of the delegates was subject to Mr. Oliver's approval, and that on one occasion he objected to a delegate alleging that he was an improper person, because he thought he would tell tales. Mitchell preceded Oliver and introduced him. This deponent was a delegate himself, and was appointed by a person *who received his instructions from Mr. Oliver*. He believes all the delegates were appointed as he was. The deponent stated, that ten men met at Thornhill Lees; Mr. Oliver was in the lane near the house. He knows that the delegates must have been approved by Oliver; he knows it for a certainty, because Oliver did actually reject one of them. The witness *considered Oliver to be the foreman of the concern*. This witness, who had turned an informer, was taken to Thornhill Lees to identify the delegates, and it was at his suggestion that Oliver was seized, but he, (Oliver), was almost immediately afterwards set at liberty by a person in authority, who said— "he must be liberated, he is the Government spy, or agent, or words to that effect."

For the accuracy of this portion of the evidence, we appeal to the Magistrates present at the examination, and we beg again to press upon their consideration the propriety of laying the whole of the depositions taken on that occasion before the public. If our frequent calls for the details of the proceedings at Wakefield, on the 16th inst. and for the long-promised statement of Lord Sidmouth in justification of the system of *espionage*, has the appearance of pertinacity, we have no other apology to offer for our perseverance than that which arises out of a deep anxiety for the establishment of truth, and a sincere wish to rescue our countrymen from the stigma which has been cast upon their character, it order to find a pretence for suspending their liberties.

On Wednesday se'nnight, two persons, who we understand were a king's messenger and a Bow-street officer, arrived at Wakefield, and arrested Benjamin Scholes, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State, and immediately took him away for London. They starched his house and examined his papers, but did not carry one away with them. This was all done with such secrecy, that the fact was not known beyond the circuit of his family till Friday noon. — *Wakefield Star*

*Charges of Treasonable Practices.*— On Thursday night, a man of the name of Scholes, was brought to London by a King's Messenger and a Bow-street officer, from Wakefield. On Friday Scholes underwent an examination at the Secretary of State's Office for the Home Department, before Lord Sidmouth, the Law Officers, Sir N. Conant, &c. At the same time several others, who had been in custody for some time, were brought from the House of Correction, and underwent an examination. After which Scholes was sent off to Cambridge prison.— On Saturday night, between nine and ten o clock, a King's Messenger and a Bow-Street Officer arrived in town with another man in custody, on a charge of Treasonable Practices, by virtue of a warrant issued against him, signed by Lord Viscount Sidmouth, as Secretary of State. On account of the lateness of the hour, no person was in attendance at the Secretary of State's Office, and no Magistrate being sitting, he was lodged in the House of Correction.

William Wheatley, who was brought to London on Saturday night, was on Monday removed from the House of Correction to the Secretary of State's Office for the Home Department, where he underwent an examination before Lord Viscount Sidmouth, the Law Officers, Sir N. Conant, &c. He was afterwards remanded. The Messenger and Officer brought him from Huddersfield, in Yorkshire.

*Oliver the Spy.*— This fellow, whom no invitation seems likely to drag from his hiding place, is said to be a native of Wales, and a carpenter by trade. He was last summer a prisoner in the Fleet, where he would have been starved, had it not been for some friends to reform— of whom he pretended to be one of the most zealous. He is also a freemason, (but we hope, will not long remain so,) and secretary to the Royal Public Lodge. No. 100, held at Mr. Murphey's, the Golden Hind, little Moorfields. He is a tall good-looking man, near six feet in height, and inclined to be corpulent. He was a few years ago a serjeant in the grenadier company of the Whitechapel volunteers.— *Liverpool Mercury*.

...

Since our last, were committed to York Castle, ... — Also, Thomas Riley, of Crosland Moor, tailor, charged upon the oath of one credible witness, with being accessory before the fact, and procuring, counselling, commanding, or abetting others to bring about and commit certain riots, unlawful assemblies, and felonies, at the parishes of Kirkburton, Almondbury and Huddersfield, or one of them, and which riots, unlawful assemblies, and felonies, took place on the night of the 8th of June last.-Also, Benjamin Green, of Honley, cloth dresser, charged upon the oath of Joshua Kemp, with being present and aiding and assisting in a riot and unlawful assembly, at the township of Honley on Saturday, the 8th of June last, and tumultuously going about, and unlawfully and feloniosly demanding, stealing, taking and carrying away certain fire arms, from the dwelling-houses of Sarah Jessop and others, in Honley aforesaid. Also, Joseph Jysop, of Lockwood, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Charles Earnshaw, with being present and aiding and assisting in a riot and unlawful assembly, and bearing arms, at a place called Folly Hall Bridge, in Huddersfield on the night of Sunday the 8th June last, to the terror of the people, and along with others unknown, and with intent to have done some of his Majesty's liege subjects some grievous bodily harm.

### YORK LAMMAS ASSIZES

These Assizes commenced at the Castle in York on Monday the 21st July. Mr. Baron Wood presided in the criminal Court. The following is his charge to the Grand Jury.

"Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,—I am sorry to observe, there are a larger number prisoners than has been usual at the Summer Assizes, and particularly concerned to find that the number is increased by no less than twenty-four persons from the Western part of this county, charged with committing grievous riots, and of being concerned in tumultuary outrages. I was in hopes that the examples made in this place, a few years ago, would have made such an impression upon the minds of these people, as would have deterred them from engaging in future in any similar acts of outrage. I am sorry that they have not produced this effect, and that this disposition to outrage does not seem have been repressed.

"The first prisoner in the Calendar, charged with being present in these tumultuary assemblages, is also charged with feloniously holding, presenting and levelling a gun, with intent to kill or do some grievous bodily harm. This offence, as at present described, is only a misdemeanor, and not a felony, and I make this observation, because, from the use of the word feloniously, it seems have been the intention to charge it as a capital offence under Lord Ellenborough's act; but in order to constitute this offence, there should be, in addition to the levelling and presenting the gun, the further act either of firing at, or of pulling the trigger with such intention, and thereby to kill or do grievous bodily harm to some of his Majesty's subjects. The offence, as it stands, is only a misdemeanor, though a misdemeanor attended with very aggravating circumstances. There are others charged with stealing fire-arms, and the stealing of arms by force is undoubtedly a felony, and a most enormous offence, and bills of felony will be presented to you against these persons. With respect to the persons charged generally with being concerned in these tumultuary assemblages, it seems to me that their offence will amount only to a misdemeanor more or less aggravated; what their precise or ultimate object was, does not appear from any evidence before the Court— that it was in the highest degree illegal can admit of no doubt, and it is deeply to be lamented that any persons should be so infatuated and deluded as to engage in tumultuary proceedings of this description. It is true they may produce much present mischief, but Justice will certainly overtake the parties who engage in them, and their schemes will issue only in their own misery and ruin, if not death. It is unquestionably the duty of every good subject, and more especially of the magistracy, to exert themselves to the utmost in the suppression of these dangerous outrages, and in the detection and apprehension of the persons who engage in them that they may be brought to condign punishment.

TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS

Friday July 25— *Joseph Sykes*, of Honley, clothier; *Isaac Johnson*, late of Holmfirth; *Joshua Thewlis*, late of Holmfirth; *Abraham Oldham*, of Marsh Plat, in Honley; *John Oldham*, of Marsh Plat, in Honley; and *Benjamin Donkersly*, of Honley, weaver; were arraigned, for that they, together with *George Taylor*, and *Benjamin Shaw*, (not yet taken) and other persons to the Jury unknown:— Did about twelve in the night of the of the 8th  of June last, burglariously break into the dwelling-house of Clement Dyson, of Honley aforesaid, and feloniously steal, take, and carry away therefrom, one gun, value 40s. from the person of Mrs. Dyson; putting her in fear—There were several counts, charging the crime in different ways.—To this indictment the prisoners severally pleaded *Not Guilty*.

Mr. Topping stated, that it was a capital offence burglariously to enter into a dwelling-house and stealing therefrom. The prisoners who stood before the Jury, were indicted for burglariously entering a dwelling-house at and stealing therefrom a gun. He would state at the outset, that this prosecution was carried on by Government. He felt, and he was sure the Jury, and all good men must agree in feeling, that this was a case of such a nature, that the government would have deserted the interest of the country, if it had not submitted it to the decision of a Jury. The crime attacking the houses of individuals;—breaking-in; demanding arms; and this done by numbers, to the amount one, two, or three or four and twenty, demands imperiously the interference of Government for the protection of peaceable subjects. He, for his part, felt pity for those who were so minded to suppose that such numbers of people, collected, at that time night, and so acting, did not call upon any Government, who attended to the interests of the people they governed, to protect private property front outrage, and the law from infringement. If such outrageous proceedings, in the dead of Sunday night—getting arms—were not circumstances that called for interference, he for his part did not know what circumstance could call for interference. It did not, however, follow, that, because this ia a prosecution from Government, the Jury were to find the prisoners guilty without evidence. God forbid! The Jury would listen to the case as if it were brought at the instance of any private individual. God forbid that any Government should institute a trial which was not so meant to be heard, or that a Government should find persons willing to conduct it. "If the facts are proved before you, Gentlemen, you will have this question to decide, whether the Law or the Criminals shall yield. I know I am addressing myself to men of integrity, who will acquit the prisoner if the facts are not proved; who will have firmness enough to give their verdict against them if they are satisfied of their guilt."

Mrs. *Hannah Dyson* called—She stated,—I am the of wife Clement Dyson; and live at Honley, about three miles from Huddersfield. I went to bed somewhere about nine o'clock that evening. I locked and barred the house door; we have only one door. While in bed asleep, perhaps two hours after I had gone to bed, I was awoke by a great noise, as of a company of men coming to the door, and knocking. They called out, your firelock immediately. I said I had lent it; but they replied, we know better than that— you have the firelock and we must have it immediately. They were outside at this time; and continued knocking— I then said, "Jane, where is the gun?" to one of my little daughters—she said, in the garret. I called to the men, will you pray be quiet and go home, my husband's not at home. They answered, we do not want your husband, we want your gun. They kept knocking on, and said, if you do not fetch it, and open the door, we will break the door all to pieces, and they kept knocking on. Then I went for the gun to the garret; and while I was fetching it down, they kept knocking on, and broke open the door, just as I was coming down. The bar and lock were both broken off the door. They met me at the bottom of the steps, and I gave them the gun, which was my husband's. The person that took the gun came a little in; but I did not know him, as it was dark just there, within the door. They said, thank you mistress, when I gave them the gun, and went away. I opened the door, just as I could see and said, "You are a set of Ludding rogues; and will never be quiet till you all be hung in a band." One of them said, "Turn again and blow a ball through her." I said, "*Fell* dare you?"— I saw the men standing in three rows. I think there were about 7 in the front row. I cannot say how many were in the other ranks. I saw Joseph Sykes going up the steps into the road. My house is lower down than the road; the steps are about 4 yards from house.—Joseph Sykes had a waistcoat on, wrong side out. I cannot say whether he had on a coat; but I just saw the pockets of the waistcoat wrong side out. I knew Sykes a little before. He lives about a quarter of a mile from my house. I do not know what trade he is. I am sure he is the man. I really thought he was the man. I have no doubt he is the man. I saw him next morning between 8 and 9, just up above my door. He said, have you had the men at your door last night?— I said, you was like to know when you was one of them. He turned his back, and went as white as a clout when I told him, and went away. I cannot say I see any of the other men here. There was Benjamin Donkersley, but I do not see him here. [*On looking round more attentively, however, and being desired to point him out, the witness fixed upon Donkersley, at the farther end of the bar.*] I am sure he was there. He stood near my door, he was one of the first row, I think. I had seen him before that evening between nine and ten. He was in a little field before our house, making a motion as if he had a gun in his hand; but he had nothing in his hand. There was another man with him, who was doing nothing but watching him. The other man had nothing in his hand. They went away when they saw me. I do not know the value of the gun. My husband did not buy it. He had it given him last Ludtime, at Chester. It was a good gun. It had a gold touch hole. It was complete; and this man (pointing to the prisoner Sykes) knows that; for he let it off three or four days before at my door. It might be worth 30s. I say that value, though I do not know.

On her cross-examination she said she was as glad to give the gun as they were to take it, because she was afraid of their threats. It was quite dark in the house, and it was dark where the man stood who took the gun. He could not take it without putting his foot forward. She knew both Sykes and Robinson. This witness's examination occupied three hours.

*Samuel Wimpenny* sworn—I know Isaac Johnson.—I saw him in June last, the night of Sunday the 8th, I saw him at the bottom of Sow Lane, about ten.—He was going to a meeting at the Banks. He said I must go and get myself ready, and meet him at the bottom of the lane. Jonathan Fellas was with me, Joshua Thewlis stood in the lane, a little beyond Isaac Johnson. It was Thewlis, the prisoner, (pointing him out.) Fellas went to his house, and I went to mine, a little higher the lane. I have served my apprenticeship with his father. I had got my supper, and was doffing to go to bed; for I had determined on not going to the meeting, when Isaac Johnson came to see if I was ready, I said I should not like to go. He said Joshua Thewlis and t'other were waiting at the bottom of the lane. He said if I did not go, it would be life and death. He said Richard Haigh had said it would be life and death if they did not go; for they would be safer there than at home. Haigh lives at the bridge, near Holmfirth. I then yielded that I would as far as Far End and look at them. I had been wet, and put on dry stockings. As he went out, he said he would go and see where the others were. Jonathan Fellas then came, and wished to know if I had gotten ready. Thewlis was at the door, and told us Johnson had gone to call Cockin, and John Donkersley. We went to Far End with Thewlis. There were several persons there. I knew none them but Isaac Johnson, John Donkersley, Joshua Thewlis, Joseph Cockin, Jonathan Fellas, and Joseph Beaumont. There were 30 or 40 men, as I can reckon, and I saw six or seven with guns and pistols. When I got amongst them, they were all in confusion. Some were for one thing—some for another—some for going into Honley—some for going home. One said he would make them all fall into ranks, and march to Hinley. Far End may be about a quarter of mile from Honley.—They fell into ranks. The armed men marched first, the rest followed in rows, two deep. I do not know the name of the first place we went to. It is a little house, down in a close, about the Bank. I have learned since it was Wm. Heelis's. We demanded arms. We went to Clement Dyson's in a body. They demanded arms, I not know who spoke. They refused to open the door. I then heard Isaac Johnson say, "Damn it—knock it open." They were all standing cluttered about the steps. I was standing at the back side, at the top of the road. Johnson was one of them. Some of them knocked at the door. I heard Thewlis also say, Damn it—knock it open. They knocked pretty loudly; but I do not know whether they knocked it open, as it opened from within. I was about 8 yards from them. The door opened, and they demanded arms. I did not see them get a gun. But as I was coming back, I heard one of them say they had got a gun or pistol, which he said he had seen the woman give them. I left them soon after. Next day I saw Johnson with Fellas, I asked him how they had gone on, and how far they went. He said they went to several other places and demanded arms. He charged me and Fellas to tell nobody what we had seen that night, for if we did, they would hang us. I saw Thewlis and Fellas on Wednesday night after.— Thewlis charged me to say nothing if I was taken up. I have not seen Fellas since. He has run.

Cross-examined, he said, he knew nothing of the meeting, and should not have went had he not been frightened into it by Johnson's speech. No favour was held out to him for giving his evidence; he has been custody ever since.

*Joshua Kemp* sworn.—I live at Honley. I was out in the evening of June 8. I first saw Uriah Butterworth between 10 and 11, in Thurston, near Honley. I was going home to bed when I met him. He told me if I would go to Honley-bridge I should see many hundred people, as something was to be done that night at Huddersfield. I went to Honley-bridge, and saw the two Oldhams— none others of the prisoners Were there. There were half a score of them at that time. Honley bar is on the bridge. We went altogether to Far End, near Honley. We were to meet the Holmfirth people there. There might be between 20 and 30 there. The Holmfirth people said they would not go to Huddersfield without arms; and Geo. Taylor proposed they should and collect arms at Honley, they should first go to Godfrey Sanderson's. The two Oldhams were there; and, (pointing to Johnson) this man. Abraham Oldham was armed when we came to the bridge with a gun. He took with him. None of the others that came from Honley Bar were armed. I was one of the party at Clement Dyson's house. I know Clement Dyson. They went to the door, knocked, and cried for arms. I was about 10 yards from the door with the two Oldhams. They knocked and called for arms. I heard two say, knock it open but I do not know who they were. Mrs. Dyson came to the door, and I went down to the wall side, about 5 yards from her. I do not know who got the gun. He put his foot and hand forward to receive it, inside the door. I cannot recollect seeing Johnson there. The gun was carried away.

Cross-examined—I never saw Johnson before that night. I cannot pretend to say he was at Dyson's, as I did not see him. I know him now. Mrs. D. was inside the door when she gave the gun. 

*Susan Hurst* sworn—I live in Honley. I know Sykes. He next door neighbour. I recollect what happened on the night Sunday June 8—I heard that night a gentle rape at Sykes's door, about 12 o'clock. I heard one person say to another, Step forward David my lad; we'll have no nonsense at Berrycroft's-hill tonight. I heard footsteps come down Sykes's stairs.— Between five and six o'clock in the morning Sykes was in my house. I asked him what made him so long coming down after that gentle rap. He said he could neither find his holiday breeches, nor his every-day breeches, and that he had put on his waistcoat wrong side out in his hurry. He said he was vary sickly and faint, and that he had had no sleep.

Cross-examined—I have lived four years next door to Sykes. He has a wife and three small children, the youngest about two months, the oldest about 5 years—I cannot be positive that he came down, only from his own words.

*Kemp*, called again by prisoner's counsel—I remained with them till the last. I went to the bottom of Taylor Hill. I left them there about two in the morning. The party went to Sykes's after we had been at.Dyson's. They went to his door, it was to get his gun. The crowd said, neither Joseph nor his gun are in the house.

The examinations of the prisoners, in which various acts outrage were detailed; and in one of which the object of the insurgents was stated to be Revolution, were then put in and read.

Several witnesses were called prove that had told various stories relative to these transactions, and had repeatedly said, in their hearing, that she not know one of the persons who came to the house. They also gave the prisoners a good character—these persons were acquaintances the prisoners.

The Counsel for the prosecution wished the examinations before the Magistrates put in, but the Judge would not receive them. The Counsel for the prisoners insisted that not one them had been identified. The Jury turned round in the box, and in two minutes pronounced their verdict, finding all the prisoners, *Not Guilty*.

Saturday July 26— *Benjamin Lockwood*, of Salford; *George Woffenden*, *John Wilson*, and *Joseph Jysop*, were put to the bar, charged with having on the 8th of June last, at Huddersfield, together with certain other persons not yet in custody, been present, aiding, and assisting, to a person unknown, in shooting a loaded gun at David Alexander, with intent to kill and murder the said David Alexander. Other counts charged the prisoners with intent to wound, lame, maim, or to do some grievous bodily harm to Mr. Alexander.

Mr. Richardson opened the case.

Mr. Topping stated to the Jury, that the four prisoners at the bar, as his learned friend had just stated, stood indicted, for having, in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, been concerned in maliciously aiding, counselling, and assisting some persons unknown, either to kill or maim a person of the name of Alexander, on the night of the 8th of June last. The learned Counsel said that the circumstances of the case, which he would shortly state, were of such a character, that he had no doubt that the Jury would concur with him in thinking they ought made the subject of public discussion. They were, indeed, such as well deserved examination. It would have been disgraceful to any country, governed by law, if such proceedings had been suffered to pass unnoticed. It would be for the Jury to say, whether the prisoners at the bar, or any of them, were the parties engaged in them. Some of the present Jury, perhaps, were the Jury of yesterday. With the decision of that Jury he respectfully acquiesced. The object of that charge was to prove attack on the house of an individual for the purpose of stealing arms. The business of this day will lead to the use which was made of the arms when obtained. On Sunday, the 8th of June last, a number of persons had met together, at or near Huddersfield, between twelve and one o'clock. The four prisoners at the bar were amongst a party of insurgents, who fired a loaded gun at Mr. Alexander; and now stand charged with being present and assisting at that outrage. The question the jury had to decide upon was, whether the prisoners, or any of them, were present, and giving countenance to the person who fired this shot, and struck the horse of Mr. Alexander; for, if they were so present, they were equally guilty, (as the learned Judge would tell them) as the person who actually fired it; and they were equally guilty, whether they fired at Mr. Alexander in particular, the party generally with whom he was. The law and justice of the country would be made a mockery and a laughing stock if this were not the case, and if every individual of criminal and unlawful assembly were not held responsible for the criminal acts of the others. It might be attempted to be proved by the Counsel for the prisoners (as was done yesterday) that the witness whom he would call, Armitage, was an accomplice. He was, however, going peaceably to his own home; and was compelled to be an eye-witness of the proceedings. There was no pretence for calling him an accomplice; but supposing he was an accomplice, no one at this time of day would venture to call in question the competency of such a witness. Unless the law, indeed, had wisely suffered the testimony of accomplices to be given, it would have been often impossible to convict persons of crimes of great public importance. But if the case rested upon the evidence of an accomplice only, it was certainly the duty of a jury to pause and hesitate before they found a prisoner guilty. A Jury, it is true, had before now, under the direction of as learned and upright a Judge as ever sat upon a bench, convicted a criminal upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice, But he (Mr. Topping) did not call upon the Jury for that. In the first place, his witness was *no accomplice*; and secondly he would be *confirmed*. The prisoner, Lockwood, was a prime mover in this business. He was the man who pressed Taylor into the service. But he would not recapitulate the facts. The inquiry was of infinite public importance. It was of importance that the persons guilty of this offence should be punished. It was of importance to inquire, whether they were guilty or innocent. The inquiry was necessary for public justice—necessary for public peace—and if the prisoners were guilty, necessary for public example. If the Jury, however, had any suspicion of the evidence, God forbid they should find the prisoners guilty upon it.

*Capt. Armytage* sworn. I commanded the Yeomanry at Huddersfield, on the 8th of June.— We were then on duty. I had some information, and went out to the Bridge, myself, with six of the cavalry and a constable, named Whitehead—we went on horseback. I put David Alexander, one of the cavalry, about 50 yards in advance. His horse is a whitish grey one. The Engine Bridge (also called Folly-hall-bridge) is about a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield. Shires (another of the yeomanry,) and Alexander were in front, at the bridge. The constable was with me, and the other four —my party was about 50 yards from Shires and Alexander. It is usual, in going out to patrole, to have an advanced guard. At the bridge, I almost lost sight of them, being rather dark. We had scarcely moved into a trot, to come up with them, when some one said, "they are halting." I immediately rode up, within a few yards of Alexander—they had halted. Not having known the bridge before—I cannot exactly say how near I was to it.—One of the cavalry in advance said— "Here they are." I saw a party of persons on the bridge—I could not have seen that they had arms, unless they had fired. I called to the Constable to come up to speak to the people on the bridge. A gun flashed as soon as he came up. He went before me. Alexander and Shires were also before me. Before the flash I think I heard Whitehead say something, but not quite positive: the flash came from the party on the bridge. No report—a flash in the pan. Almost immediately several other guns were fired—also from the party assembled—I could see the light—their guns were directed towards my party—I think I heard at least 20 guns—rather irregularly—I think three or four as a volley—-upon the whole, irregularly—I remained there till about ten shots were fired. From the light of the firing and from what happened, I of course looked forward. The party were assembled rather on the fall of the bridge, that is, the other side of the Crown—I being on this side, could not see over their heads so as to ascertain if there were any great number immediately behind the first ranks—but 40 or 50 yards further on, I saw a moving body.— I conclude that the space between was occupied by men—not thinking I had sufficient force, I retreated into the town, where I had greater numbers. I came out with numbers afterwards, and found they had dispersed.
  
*George Whitehead.* I am Constable at Huddersfield,—I am deputy constable, and was so in June last.— On the 8th, I went with Captain Armytage and a patrole. Six privates, the captain, and myself. We went to Engine Bridge, it was between twelve and one.— Capt. A. ordered the small party he had with him to halt, and ordered me to ride to the front, and inquire what the assembled people wanted—I went within about ten yards of them, I saw a number assembled upon the bridge. I saw that one was armed, by his presenting a piece at me, which flashed in the pan—the first thing said, was one of the mob calling, who comes there? That was before the flash. I answered, what are you doing there? There was no answer, but immediately firing commenced from the mob. I was by the end of the bridge. The firing came from the centre. It was so dark that I could not see what direction the firing came—there were five shots before I turned my horse's head round, to go back. All the shots came from the bridge. There were other shots after we commenced our retreat. Mr. Alexander was in the rear of me, within a yard of my horse. He was coming the same direction, till we halted. It is impossible for me speak to the numbers at the bridge. I should suppose upwards of 400 persons. We were nearly in a line between the bridge and Dawson's house—It is on the road side. There is a house, just at the end of the bridge—that is not Dawson's, I believe. It joins to it —is nearer than Dawson's. I examined it next morning—there appeared to have been a ball striking the wall, from the mark of the lead.

*David Alexander* sworn.—I was on duty on the 8th of June, in the Huddersfield Yeomanry. I was one of the party under Capt. Armytage. I rode a grey horse, and had a pistol in my hand. I was a little in advance within a few yards of the bridge. I halted when I saw a number of men. There were between 60 and 70 of them. Cannot say any them were dressed lighter than usual.—Capt. Armytage ordered the Constable to ask them what they wanted. A piece was presented and flashed in the pan, after the Constable spoke. I was advancing with the Constable. They said, What do you want? Constable said something which I did not rightly hear. Next thing was a flash in the pan.— A piece was then fired by the mob. I could see that it came from the end of the bridge. Several pieces were fired. I found my horse reel backwards, about the third shot. After several pieces were fired, we retreated. We came back with more force, and found the mob had dispersed. I found my horse was wounded in the fore part of the head with a ball. The ball was taken out; it was a pistol ball. I do not know what it was fired from. I examined the house near the bridge. It appeared to have been struck with a ball. The head of my horse was towards the bridge. The blood ran down his forehead from the wound. I felt the ball wound. (Produced the ball.) It was taken of horse's head. Shots were fired after we retreated.

*Nathan Taylor* sworn— I live at Well Green, about half a mile from Huddersfield, I keep a house there.—I remember the disturbances on the 8th of June. I went to bed with my wife about 10 o'clock. I was called up about midnight, between 12 and 1 perhaps. I was disturbed by some men knocking my door who said, if I did not get up immediately, they would burst it open. I then got up. I found two men at my door. Each had a gun. They insisted on my dressing myself immediately, and going with them. They came into the inside of my door. They said I was to go with them. They would not tell me where. My wife asked, and they said to her, they were going to take me to Huddersfield. I went very much against my will. I had neither gun nor any thing else in my hand. Benjamin Lockwood was one of the men that had a gun. I went with him from my house to Knowle Hill. We joined William Crowther, who was with a man that forced him to get up, as well as me. We went all to Knowle Hill field, which is between Yew Green and Folly-hall bridge, the field is about a quarter of a mile from the bridge. The field lies on the left of the road, between Lockwood and Huddersfield. About 12 or 20 persons were there, when we went. We joined them. One of them had a gun. I cannot say any others were armed. I saw two scythes under a wall, but not in the hands of anyone. The party were about 12 yards from the scythes. Crowther and I stopped there about five minutes, and then made our escape. I returned home.

Cross-examined—It was a dark night, and on that account I cannot safely swear he was the man. I thought he was the man. My house is about a quarter of a mile from his house, I have had many opportunities of seeing him for a year past.

*George Armitage*, sworn.—I am a shoemaker. I know Engine bridge. I was passing it the 8th of June. I had been a courting to a young girl at Lockwood. Before I came to the bridge, two men stopped me. I was coming from Lockwood to Huddersfield. They presented two guns at Charles Earnshaw and me. They said, come over into the field. Earnshaw asked what to do? They made answer, they wanted to see how many they could muster that night. Earnshaw turned round to me, and said, must we Armitage? The men said, if you don't come over, we'll shoot you. They forced us over the wall and drove us up the field. It was about half-past twelve. When we got up the field, there were a crowd of people. There were two handkerchiefs at the top the wall.— I heard somebody say, those that have arms come hither. I saw some with guns, some with pistols. I cannot say how many. Eight or nine had guns or pistols. They went to the wall. A man that stood by the wall pulled something out of his pocket, and gave it to one of them.— It was a square lump. The man who got it came away, and said he had got twelve rounds. [On being desired to look at the four prisoners, he fixed upon three them by name, John Wilson, and Benjamin Lockwood—and the other prisoner by sight.] I did not see any of them in the *field*. I saw them all at the bridge, about the time of the firing. One man got a square lump the field, and said he had got twelve rounds. There was a lump as large as my hat in each handkerchief. I saw Joseph Croft in the field.—Somebody said, to those who had arms, that they might down to the rest. They all joined together. When we got to the bottom of the field, Earnshaw was going to turn, to go to Lockwood. They said. This is the road, and turned him back. We went to the bridge. They held two scythes across the road to prevent me from crossing the road. It was not one of the prisoners that stopped me with the scythes. I saw that man, (Joseph Jyssop,) also standing with a scythe at the foot of the bridge. Joseph Croft appeared to command. He said to them all that were armed, "kneel down." They stood on each side of the road and kneeled down opposite each other. They extended from the bridge to the foot of the bridge. Their faces were towards Huddersfield. George Woffenden had a gun; Lockwood had gun. John Wilson ran past me with a gun or a pistol. When the Cavalry were coming up, Joseph Croft ordered them to keep kneeling; and cried out three times, Who come there? I was not on the bridge, but the causeway.— I heard him shout out, *"Fire!"* I was running away then, after a single piece had been fired first, and a good many afterwards. I saw Woffenden upon the bridge, with a gun, before the firing commenced. Lockwood was on the bridge with his gun. Jyssop had a scythe, before the firing, at the bridge. Wilson came running, after the dispersement, from the bridge towards Lockwood. He ran past me, while I was running too, about twenty-five yards from the bridge. I followed him betwixt the woods. When we were there, a gun went off on the top of Taylor-hill. Somebody said, have you nothing to answer it; upon which Wilson fired off his pistol. I then saw it. This might be about five minutes after I left the bridge. I went back to the girl at Lockwood, but she would not let me in. She had locked the door.

Cross-examined—The field called Knowle Hill, is where the handkerchiefs were. I saw Wilson in the field, not the others. I saw none of them there before I went to the bridge.

*Capt. Armytage* called again.— I am positive the first shot was fired from the opposite party.

Two witnesses in favour of the prisoners deposed, that they had heard G. Armitage declare, that he did not know any of the persons who were among the mob. Others gave the prisoners a good character as far as they knew them.

The Jury after retiring about quarter of hour, brought all the prisoners—*Not Guilty*.

The Judge—"Prisoners at the bar, Take care of yourselves for the future. You have now had a very narrow escape, and if you persist in such practices as these, you may depend upon it you will bring yourselves to an untimely end.— Have a care of your future conduct."

*Prisoners*, (simultaneously).—"We will, indeed, Sir."

YORK ASSIZES— July 25, TRIAL OF LUDDITES.

Benjamin Donkersly, Joseph Sykes, Isaac Johnson, Joshua Thewlis, Abraham Oldham, and John Oldham, were indicted for a robbery and burglary at the house of Clement Dyson, in Honley. on the night of Sunday the 8th of last.— Hannah Dyson, Samuel Winpenny, Joshua Kemp, and Susan Hurst, were severally examined; after which Mr. Baron Wood summed up the evidence, pointing out its nature, and how it applied to the different prisoners. — The jury, after consulting for a short time, returned a verdict of *Not Guilty* with regard to all.— The two Oldhams were then put to the bar on another charge; but the prosecution calling no evidence, they were acquitted.

July 26.  
TRIALS OF THE HUDDERSFIELD RIOTERS.

Benjamin Lockwood, George Woffenden, John Wilson, and Joseph Jyssop, charged with being present, counselling, aiding, and assisting, a person unknown, in firing a loaded gun at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry, at Folly Hall Bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th June last, were *acquitted*.

All the rioters against whom true bills were found are, we believe, now tried and acquitted.

From the evidence, it is quite clear that the riots were of a most alarming character, though the guilt of having been engaged in them was not fixed upon the persons who have stood their trials.

The Judge exhorted the prisoners to beware of continuing in such dangerous courses. They had had a narrow escape, and might rest assured, if they continued such practices, they would infallibly come to an untimely death. The prisoners answered, simultaneously, "We will, indeed, my Lord."

The Lord Lieutenant was present during these trials.— The verdicts, we understand, were received with the most profound silence.— It was rumoured, at York, on Saturday night, that no further prosecutions against the Rioters still remaining in custody, would be gone into.— Tho. Riley, of Crosland Moor, tailor, and Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, clothier, are detained, under a warrant from Lord Sidmouth, on suspicion of High Treason.

Poor quality, but reappears in

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001476/18170716/004/0002
## London Courier and Evening Gazette - Wednesday 16 July 1817

We copy the following article from the Leeds Intelligencer of Monday, received this morning:—

"The state affairs in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield has been much more serious than we imagined, and there is still some ground of alarm, for the further probable progress of the disaffected in that quarter; Twenty-three prisoners, in all, have been sent to York Castle, some of them charged with high-treason, others with rioting, stealing arms, & c. Eighteen still remain in custody at Huddersfield, of whom four, and fifth since discharged, were apprehended on Tuesday night last, namely, *John Spencer*, Cleckheaton; *Edward Fletcher*, cardmaker, Hightown; *Benjamin Heptonstall*, cloth-dresser, Hightown *James Clegg*, of Hightown; and *————— Sampson*, Robert-Town, who is discharged. Besides these, about 50 men, against whom there are informations far having been concerned in the late outrages, have absconded; but they are diligently looked for by the civil authorities, and hopes are entertained that many of them will yet be apprehended. One of these fellows formerly resided in Leeds, which he was forced to quit. This precious *Reformer* of the State was, it appears, to have been Lieutenant-General of that insurrectionary army, which the disaffected hoped would have existed in great force on the day fixed for the general rising. His late residence is close to Folly-hall Bridge, at which the small party of Yeomanry under Capt. ARMYTAGE were attacked by the insurgents; and the deserted house now bears the mark of having been struck by a ball from the fire of the infatuated madmen w|io were marching to their own destruction and that of their country.

"The information previously obtained saved Huddersfield that night from the most horrible fate. The band which was met at Folly-Hall-bridge constituted only one part of the numerous insurgents, whose plan was to have attacked the town simultaneously and by surprise. In the hope that the Magistracy would have intimation of their approach, the night of attack was changed from that of Monday the 9th to Sunday the 8th of June.— Marching silently and rapidly to the execution of their plan, the military were to have been suddenly secured and their arms taken by the insurgents; while the Magistrates were to have been seized, kept as hostages, and compelled to use their authority in favour of the insurrection. Several individuals were marked out for massacre, and the daring ruffians who were engaged in these outrageous proceedings entertained confident hopes that the town would have been in their undisputed possession before morning. Plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent, no doubt, would have succeeded the authority of the Magistracy and the rule of the laws.

"Most fortunately, intelligence had been obtained of the meditated attack. The Civil and Military Authorities were on the alert. The spirited corps of yeomanry, as well as the regular troops, were under arms. The town was in a complete state of preparation for defence and encounter with the insurgents, at Folly-Hall-bridge, by convincing them their plan was detected, frustrated, for the present, their enterprize and their hopes. Many of the inhabitants heard the firing, the alarm of the bugle, the galloping of the cavalry through the streets, and awaited, in breathless anxiety, the result.

"A master shoemaker, of Huddersfield, in respectable credit, and flourishing business, is another of the persons who have absconded. He has been seen in Hamburgh since his flight; and, it is to be hoped, will repent him, in his wretched exile, of the courses which have compelled him to fly from those blessings in this county which he was unworthy to enjoy.

"In our last we announced the apprehension of a man at Huddersfield, on Friday the 4th instant, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State. He turns out to be one of the Thornhill Lees Delegates, *Benjamin Whiteley*, of Holmfirth, clothdrawer; and has been in the regular receipt for the labour of himself and his wife, of not less than *four pounds per week!!!*. He is committed to Salisbury prison.

"One of the chief Conspirators, now in gaol, warily avoided engaging personally in the outrages. He, however, assisted actively at all the meetings for arranging the plan; and has been impeached since the apprehension of some of his accomplices. On being taken up himself, he said, he had for many years kept the Law and the Government at defiance and now he was betrayed to destruction by a set of his own blockheads at last! While he was in custody of the Constables who were charged to convey him, escorted by cavalry, to York Castle, he was placed in an upper room, till the horses were ready; he had seized the opportunity to attempt self-destruction, and the Constables cut him down after he had actually suspended himself from a bedstead in the apartment!

"On the accuracy of the preceding particulars the public may rely; as we have carefully examined into the truth of the facts, during the past week, on the spot. While there has been so much falsehood and misrepresentation palmed upon the country, we have much pleasure in being also able to state, that after making the most diligent inquiry at Huddersfield, we cannot find that any one of the numerous persons apprehended has pretended to charge Oliver, or any other individual, with having seduced or entrapped him. Not one, indeed, as far as we can learn, appears to have even had any knowledge of Oliver's visit to this district.

"The spirited and highly respectable corps of Huddersfield Yeomanry (100 strong) are above all praise, for their late and present patriotic exertions."

The Gazette of last night contains Royal Proclamation, pardoning all individuals who have been guilty of frame-breaking, and who shall, before the first day September next, appear before some Justice of the Peace and declare when and where their offence was committed. This Proclamation, combined with the Act which has lately passed the Legislature, for the more severe punishment of those who shall henceforward guilty outrages, will, we trust, put speedy end practices not less disgraceful the public character than they are dangerous the public tranquillity.

### THE HUDDERSFIELD INSURRECTION

An inflated and highly exaggerated account of the state of the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield, during the past month, has been published in the Leeds Intelligencer, and copied into the London Ministerial papers. Such a publication, on the eve of the trial at York, we hold to be extremely reprehensible, and must, as far as it is believed, have a tendency to prejudice the minds of the jury appointed to sit in judgement upon the lives of the accused. To assert in a public print before the trials come on, and of course on *ex parte* evidence, that the object of the prisoners was "massacre," and that their plans were to be consummated by "plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent," is to prejudge their cause, and to deprive these unfortunate men of the benefit of that salutary maxim of the English law, which holds every man to be innocent till a jury of his countrymen has pronounced him guilty. Without pretending to be at all in the secrets of the insurgents, we must say, we have too favourable an opinion of our species and of our countrymen, to believe that any numerous body of them in a particular neighbourhood, could be brought to be the actors in a sedition, that was to inflict "massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage," upon their neighbours, "to a fearful extent." The intention of the insurgents, as far as we can learn, was to effect a "bloodless revolution," and the purpose of seizing and *disarming* the military, as stated is the account before us, seems to favour that supposition. That a bloodless revolution could have been effected, is, to be sure, a supposition too gross to be entertained by any set of men of common understanding; but Mr. Oliver, it seems, had the address to persuade the leaders that a project of this kind was practicable, and his dupes were so utterly ignorant as to adopt the absurdity. This fact may serve to shew of what kind of materials the Huddersfield branch of the conspiracy was formed. How many men and boys (for there was, it seems, a considerable proportion of the latter) assembled at *Folly*-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th, we cannot learn with any degree of certainty, but some estimate may be formed of their strength from the fact, that a detachment of newly-raised Yeomanry Cavalry put to flight and entirely dispersed the insurgent army! while the only blood that flowed on the occasion on either side, was the blood of a horse, and the only other mark of violence inflicted was, as the Intelligencer states, the mark of a bail which struck a deserted house! We do not wish to speak with levity of a proceeding which every friend to his country must condemn, but when we see a local act of popular violence, exaggerated to the bulk of a wide spreading insurrection, we feel it to be our duty to remove the deception, by lowering down the colouring to the standard of truth.

We have hitherto cautiously abstained from entering into the details of the violent proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield on the night of the 8th of June, satisfying ourselves with stating from time to time the committals of the prisoners to the County gaol; and this course we should have pursued, leaving the facts to be developed upon the trials, had not the exaggerated statements made in the Intelligencer induced us to depart from that determination. It now, however, becomes proper to state, that ever since the year 1812, when the Luddite system prevailed in Yorkshire, and raged more especially in the South-western plots of this Riding, there has been considerable irritation existing in the minds of some of the lower classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. This disposition, the extreme distress suffered by the labouring part of the community during the past year, tended materially to increase. For a time, the hope of Parliamentary Reform allayed the public dissatisfaction, by affording some prospect of relief, and petitions for that purpose were drawn up and signed very generally; but no sooner was the Bill for the suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act passed into a law, then hope gave place to despair; and soon after, a number of designing men, seizing the opportunity, did not hesitate to inculcate the opinion, that nothing short of a revolution could terminate the general suffering. Of these pestilent characters, the notorious Mr. Oliver was one of the principal; and we have the authority of the wife of one of the persons mentioned in the Intelligencer as a principal conspirator (George Dawson), delivered in the presence of three respectable witnesses, for saying that as long since as nearly two months ago, Oliver was in communication with the ring-leaders of the sedition, and that on one occasion he was a visitor at Dawson's house. On the same authority we state, that Mr. Oliver had held conferences with George Taylor, the leader of the mal-content forces, on the night of the 8th of June, and it is known that both Dawson and Taylor have since absconded. How Oliver conducted himself in his visits to Huddersfield, may be collected from the testimony of Dawson's wife, who says, that one morning, while she was at breakfast at Dawson's house, Oliver, among other inflammatory conversation, said -" They are all in readiness, in London. There is no occasion for bloodshed. We have only to seize the military and disarm them, and the thing is done." He added, that he had been concerned with Despard; that just before the Colonel and his associates were apprehended, he was going into a private room with them, but recollecting that he had a little business of his own to transact, he stepped out. and had not been gone half an hour, before they were all taken.

Under this kind of excitation, it is no wonder that the persons to whom such conversation was addressed, began to form traitorous designs, or rather perhaps, to cherish hopes that designs already formed might be realized. The leaders, it appears, held frequent communications with the subordinate agents. The plot thickened daily. A considerable number of men in the lowest ranks of life became involved in the conspiracy. Sunday night, the 8th of June, was appointed for the rising. Two or three hundred persons, it is said, many of them boys from 14 to 20 years, assembled at a place bearing the appropriate name of *Folly*-hall-bridge. Taylor placed himself at their head, and at 12 o'clock, the moment for commencing operations, this fanatic addressed his followers in these terms "Now, my lads, all England is in arms—our liberties are secure— the rich will be poor, and the poor will be rich." To this rabble a detachment of six Yeomanry Cavalry was at first opposed, and we verily believe that had the cavalry, small as their number were, thought proper to advance, they would have routed the insurgents, They however judged it prudent to retreat, and being reinforced by a body of their comrades, they returned to witness the dispersion of an unorganized mob that had been drawn together, some by actual force, others by an idle curiosity, and others, no doubt, with criminal designs. In the mean time, a sort of under-plot was acting, and a number of marauders were passing about the neighbourhood, forcing the peaceable inhabitants to open their doors and surrender their fire-arms. At Honley, they broke into the house of Mr. Armitage, who observed that one of the bandits seemed better dressed than his associates, that he was not like one of this country-men, and that he talked like a Londoner."

The Magistrates, who appear to have displayed a more than ordinary share of vigour, soon found means to discover and to arrest a number of the persons engaged in these criminal excesses, and twenty-four of them have been committed to York Castle, to take their trials at the Assizes, which commence this day, while about half that number still remain in confinement in the prison at Huddersfield. It is much to be regretted that the persons apprehended, and about to be put upon their trials, have for the most part, been, at most, merely the dupes of the leaders of this miserable conspiracy, and that the instigators, including Mr. Oliver, the London delegate, have been suffered to escape.

*Mr. Oliver's Cypher.*— It appears from the evidence of the principal witness for the Crown given before the Lord Lieutenant and the Magistrates at Wakefield, on Monday, the 16th of June, that Mr. Oliver corresponded with his dupes in cypher, and that one of the mottos used by him for that purpose was—  *"The Old Mother is sick, and expects all her sons to arm."*

### MINISTERIAL JUSTIFICATION OF OLIVER

*(From the Times)*

In the House of Commons on Friday, in a debate on the State of the Nation, Mr. H Addington said, he had risen principally with a view of doing justice to a much injured individual—he meant Mr. Oliver. (*hear, hear*.) Within this fortnight two magistrates within the county of York, who had received an unfavourable impression as to the conduct of Mr. Oliver in the country, had requested that he might undergo an examination at the office for the Home Department. One of these magistrates came from Yorkshire on purpose. and the other was a much respected member of that House, whose absence he regretted, as that gentleman would have corroborated the statement he had to make. These magistrates took the examination; the individual who brought the charge was confronted with Mr. Oliver, and the result was, that both magistrates declared themselves completely satisfied that the charge was false. that there was not indeed the smallest foundation for supposing that he had provoked the insurrection in the country; and that there had been nothing blameable either in the language or conduct of the person thus accused. It was his duty to make this statement, because the facts could only be made known to the house through him. Mr. Oliver had taken no part in any plots. He came to the Home-office in the beginning of April, and offered information which he considered beneficial to the country, but which he had not obtained by being implicated in any conspiracy. He asked no reward, and never received a shilling from Government, except what served to defray his travelling expenses. Information had been transmitted to the Home-office, that the insurrection which had been attempted was to break out on the 9th or 10th of June. All the magistrates in the disturbed districts. who had written on the subject, agreed in fixing upon the same date. The duty required of Mr. Oliver was to go to the country to ascertain whether this report was correct, and to transmit to the Home-office what information he might collect. This, it was supposed, would save time to the magistrates and the information, it was thought, would be more speedily collected than by relying solely on the separate communications of the magistrates. He carried letters of recommendation to five or six magistrates, and was ordered to return by the 5th of June, as by that time it was necessary that the Executive Government should be prepared with the precautions against the imminent danger which threatened the peace of the country. Mr. Oliver, however, stayed by accident a day or two beyond the limited time; and he had himself written a letter to hasten his return. When Mr. Oliver came to the office and offered to give evidence, he declared he did so in the hope of saving the country; and he was fully persuaded of his sincerity.

*Mr. Barham* doubted much whether the country, or even that House, would concur in the judgement of acquittal which the secret tribunal to which the Right Hon. Gent. referred had pronounced on the spy Oliver. Those who had not the advantage of having been present at the secret tribunal, must decide on the facts already within their knowledge. For his part, he should declare that his judgment could not be on the favourable side, when he recollected what he had heard from a departed Right Honourable friend of his, whose memory had been so justly eulogized that night. Mr. Ponsonby (who it will be recollected was a member of the Secret Committee) had told him, that he believed, in his conscience, the insurrection would not have taken place had it not been for Oliver. He had been so struck with this observation, that he asked his Right Hon. Friend to repeat what he had stated, and he did repeat it.

*Frame-breaking*.-The *Gazette* of Tuesday night contains the Proclamation of the Prince Regent, offering an amnesty to the persons concerned in the offence of frame-breaking, except in the case of the outrage at Loughborough; the intention of issuing which was announced by Lord Sidmouth on the discussion of the Frame-breaking Bill in the House of Lords. After alluding to the increase of punishment annexed to this offence by the Act recently passed, and expressing a hope that persons will thus be deterred from the future commission of such offences, the Proclamation proceeds—

"We do hereby promise and declare, that every person who hath committed any offence against the form of the Statute made in the fifty-fourth year of his Majesty's reign, for the punishment of persons destroying stocking or lace-frames, but hath not yet been charge therewith, and who shall, previous to the first day of September next ensuing, appear before some Justice of the Peace or Magistrate and declare such his offence, and when, where, and by whom the same was committed, shall receive his Majesty's most gracious pardon for such offence, and that no confession so made by any such person shall be given in evidence in any Court, or in any case whatever; provided nevertheless, that nothing herein contained shall extend to the offence so committed at Loughborough as afore said, nor to any other offence, except such as may have been committed contrary to the said Statute made in the fifty-fourth year aforesaid."

[TH: so what had distinguished the case of the Loughborough frame breakers? https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2017/07/31st-july-1817-samuel-caldwell.html http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2017/03/31st-march-1817-trial-of-luddite-john.html#more https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2017/04/james-hobson-last-luddite-executions.html ]

[Comprehensive eport of "Trial of the Rioters" p2-3]

JOHNSON and THEWLIS, two of the parties indicted in the preceding case, were immediately arraigned on another indictment, charging them with a burglary, on the night of the 8th of June, in the house of Sarah Jessop, of Honley.

Mr. Topping.—Gentlemen of the Jury, it is not my intention, on the part of the Crown, to offer any evidence before you, against the prisoners at the bar, and therefore they will be discharged.

*The Court.*—Gentlemen, You will find the prisoners —*Not Guilty*.

The prisoners, of course, were immediately acquitted.

[Then follows a report of Lockwood, Woffenden, Wilson and Jyssop]

The Lord Lieutenant was present during these trials.— The verdicts, we understand, were received with the most profound silence.— It was rumoured, at York, on Saturday night, that no further prosecutions, against the Rioters still remaining in custody, would be gone into.— Tho. Riley, of Crosland Moor, tailor, and Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, clothier, are detained, under a warrant from Lord Sidmouth, on suspicion of High Treason. ...

Thomas Riley, a prisoner in York Castle, charged with High Treason, destroyed himself in bed early on the morning of Tuesday by cutting his throat with razor, which he had purloined from a fellow prisoner for the purpose.

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002408/18171013/014/0003
Morning Herald (London) - Monday 13 October 1817

On Tuesday last, an inquisition was taken by Mr. T. Shepley, of Selby, one of the Coroners for this county, before a respectable Jury of freeholders, over the body of Thomas Riley, a prisoner in the Castle of York, charged with high treason, who destroyed himself about four o'clock in the morning of the same day (when in bed along with another prisoner, and in company with three persons), by cutting his throat with an old razor, which he had unfortunately purloined from a fellow prisoner. Upon a full and minute investigation, it was proved to the said Coroner and Jury, that at the time of his having committed the fatal deed, he was not of sound mind and understanding, but lunatic and distracted; for it appeared; that previous to his being committed to the Castle, the 4th of July last, he attempted, whilst under confinement at Huddersfield, to hang himself; and that about two months ago, he made a second attempt to do the same in the Castle, when in bed with another prisoner, but was prevented.

Drakard's Stamford News - Friday 13 February 1818

THE "RESPECTABLE" MR. OLIVER. Relative to this wretch, we copy the subjoined paragraph from the *Leeds Mercury* of last week:—

"That a very considerable agitation prevailed in the country at the period of the passing of the act which is now happily repealed, we are ready to admit; but we contend that that agitation was intentionally increased by the agents of those who took advantage of the distressed state of the country to arm themselves with arbitrary powers, and to silence the cry for a parliamentary and economical reform. Of that agency we have already frequently had occasion to speak, and we feel convinced that no man can read the artless narrative delivered by William Cliff, of Derby, at the meeting held this week in London, for affording relief to the sufferers by arbitrary imprisonment, without being convinced that Mr. Oliver was the great organizer of the sedition. This ministerial firebrand was sent through the country propagating the belief whereever he came, that "the caterpillars of the state," meaning his employers, "must be driven away"—that for this purpose the people in every part of the country was ready to rise in arms, and that those in particular who were at a distance from the scene of his instigation, would scarcely be restrained from rushing to the field. At Wakefield, and at Dewsbury, as we already know, he stated the people of London to be almost heart-broken with the public apathy in the country; and at Derby, it seems, he represented the people of Leeds to be kept down with extreme difficulty, when at the very time, it is notorious that we had scarcely a troop of regular soldiers in the town, and so tranquil and secure did the inhabitants consider themselves, that it was with great trouble, and not till after nearly three months' entreaty, that a body of yeomanry cavalry, not exceeding a hundred men, could be enrolled! And yet we are unblushingly told, both in and out of parliament, that Mr. Oliver's mission was undertaken for the purpose of enabling the government to preserve the tranquillity of the country! A hundred such peace-makers, practising upon a half‘famished population, would have created a civil war! A report has reached us, we know not how well founded, that Oliver, feeling himself incapable of braving the indignation of his countrymen, had retired to the continent, and that his dead body was found early in the last month, with a razor by his side, on the skirts of a wood between Hamburg and Bremen."

There were indeed strong reasons against the report being referred to the Committee.. when it was recollected by whom that Committee .s appointed and of whom it was composed, and that it was a Committee n of ?inisc~rs sitting in judgment upon their own actions. It was urged by Ministers that Spies, in *lonler to conciliate the confidence of the disaffected must appear to be themselves disaffected and what it was this but to allow that the natural consequences of their mission was to foment disturbance ? (Hear! hear! Oliver was represented as a man of good morals, but Mr. Bennett said he was prepared to prove that he had two wives living, and that this moral it gentleman owed to the mercy of others the worthless life which he enjoyed. Since his connection with Government as aLSpy he had travelled round the country representing himself as a London delegate, and in this character he had visited Liverpool, Manchester, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham, and Leeds, endeavouring to seduce persons in some of these places to send delegates to London, and stimulating them to endeavour to prevail upon respectable persons to call Meetings. At one of these meetings Mr. Oliver took the Chair and informed his auditors that their was no a.e in petitioning, that the people in London- were waiting for the movements of those in the country, and that nothing would do but physical force. He had appeared in Nottingham in the character of a London delegate, and urged the people in the strongest terms to riot and insurrection. Notwithstanding the assertions to the contrary, Brandreth and Oliver had been together.- 1. The plot he had laid was to insnare the people into overt acts of treason and insurrection: That this was the object and tendency of his measures could not be doubted; and it must not be fotg that from the day on which Oliver was discovered and in consequence n ceased to be a missionary ad a turistthe public !s, tranquillity had been completely restored.- Hear!  hear. NQ N eq ber in that House ever knew in his own case what it was to have a wife and children cam- during for brad !Suds cases had however occurred, r and advantage-had been taken of ietn to excite the head of the family to acts of desptriniri.

Y3 No grounds existed, Ior aarm til Oliver d h pearance, ard he attempted. to raise onean of t .country against another to secure his blood money. on the Other side of the House, it was contended generally, that the -riartive- of Uif proceedings of Oliver; as; given by the Members i liriesd of --dre House, was derived frnm a -pollued source and that a very bad and dangerous spies, existed in the cosnntryioh-g setbroto ?? t lefavssi 0 Ct rils ation of *bh1 3Mr; Canning read to 'de House ass i extract of is-letter received by His Majesty's Ministers from Earl Fitzwilliam -the -Ia:rd;Littcnane of the West-Riding of Yorkshire, in DeeL. -NI6.

He had written two letters, one of which the honourable gentleman had quoted, but the other he had passed over in silence because it did not answer his purpose. The second letter, which was founded on more into inquiry, expressed a change of opinion, and declared that there was no necessity for the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. This letter was studiously suppressed uidt only by Mr. Canning in debate, but by the Ministers in the documents which they had laid before the Secret Committee, of which he (Lord liltois) was a member. He would beg leave to inform the House hvi owiuepeopleht ad been dealt it with in this Committee. There were, laid before it several communications from the Lords' Lieutenants of Counties on the state of the country, but no communication was sent from din e Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire (Earl Fitzwilliam.)- (Hear, Hear! ) How fiur tis was acting fairly, he would leave the House to decide _(Hear, hear) After some observations from Lord Castlereagh, in  which he upbraided Lord Milton with disclosing the secrets of the Secret Committee; the House divided, when there appeared, for ?? motion of .1r.

## Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Wednesday 25 March 1818

Richard Lee:— The following account is given in the *Leeds Intelligencer* of an investigation, at the recent Quarter Sessions, at York, respecting the contents of Richard Lee's Petition to the House of Commons:— We have more once alluded to the Petition to the House of Commons:—

"We have more than once alluded to the Petition to the House of Commons of *Richard Lee*, of Holmfirth, one of the men apprehended under the Suspension Act, in which the Petitioner complains of the injustice of his arrest, and of cruel and vindictive treatment during his imprisonment in York Castle. The deservedly high character of Mr. Staveley, Governor of the Castle, and the well-known excellent management of the prison, were alone sufficient to repel the aspersions of Lee. But, we are happy to state, that Lee himself has been personally examined, and that the result has been that of indelibly stamping the allegations of his Petition as false. At the General County Sessions, holden on the 12th inst. at York, it was agreed upon by above 70 Magistrates, that a Committee should be appointed for the purpose of thoroughly investigating the case. He accordingly appeared, in consequence of notice sent to him express, before 15 Magistrates, who assembled at the Castle on Monday last; and who in vain endeavoured to draw from him any charge against Mr. Staveley, or against the worthy Gentleman's management of the prison, or any complaint as to the treatment received by himself while in his custody. In the face the audacious assertions contained in his own Petition, he now denied that he had ever made any complaint against Mr. Staveley, that he had any complaint to offer.— Scarce any other answer to questions could be obtained from him, but that his complaint was against those who had caused his imprisonment, *who were not there to vindicate themselves*, and not against Mr. Staveley, who *had the means of refuting his former assertions*. The Magistrates, very properly, were not satisfied with those answers, but proceeded, notwithstanding, to a most 'strict and careful examination of the most minute charges contained in the Petition.—The result was the utter confusion of Lee, who cut a most despicable figure during the examination, it being ascertained beyond a doubt, that his treatment had been in every respect humane–and that the only step taken for the security of his person, had been to put a single iron upon one of his legs–a precaution which the exposed situation of the gaol rendered indispensable.

To the Editor of the York Herald,

Sir,  
My numerous friends being very desirous to know the result of the Investigation that has lately taken place in consequence of Richard Lee's petition to the House of Commons, I hope I shall not be thought of acting improperly, to intrude upon the public, in refutation of the vile attack on my character, by stating, that upon the conclusion of the personal inquiry of the said Richard Lee, by the Committee of Magistrates deputed for that purpose, the Chairman read to me, by their desire, the Report they were about to make, and which as far as my memory serves, was in substance, that they were unanimously of opinion, that no blame whatever attached to me or any of those under my orders, but that considering the important duty I had to perform, the treatment of Richard Lee, in York Castle, was in every respect humane and proper. I hope I may also be further allowed to state, that Richard Lee, in my hearing (during his examination), declared to the Magistrates that he had no complaint whatever to make against me, nor did he ever mean to do so, although the Copy of his Petition was at that time read over to him.

In hopes the subject will at some convenient opportunity, be brought forward again in the House of Commons, I beg to subscribe myself, Sir,  
Your obedient humble Servant,  
Wm. STAVELEY.  
Keeper of York Castle.

Sun (London) - Tuesday 24 March 1818

PARLIAMENTARY PETITIONERS.

The infamous falsehoods upon which most of the Petitions to the House of Commons, from wretches who attempted to subvert the Government of the Country, were founded, would make us wonder that any persons should degrade themselves and insult the Legislature by presenting them, if we did not know the influence of Party. Any others of a similar kind was one presented case of RICHARD LEE, and of that we may say *ex uno disce omnes*. But as facts are the best arguments, we shall avail ourselves of the information afforded us in a Provincial Journal, to which we have often been indebted, and which is conducted with such spirit, energy, and true patriotism, as to entitle it to the approbation of Ministers and the esteem of the country. The following is extracted from *The Leeds Intelligencer* of yesterday:—

"TO OUR READERS.

Sir Francis Burdett having given notice, that be shall bring BEN SCHOLES's Petition before the House of Commons, after the recess, we think proper to defer our refutation of it till that period."

In the Intelligencer of the 9th inst. it will be recollected we inserted a copy of the petitio to the House Of Commons, of Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, one of the men apprehended under the Suspension Act, in which the petitioner complains of the injustice of his arrest, and of cruel and vindictive treatment during his imprisonment at York Castle.

"Though the deservedly high character of Mr. Stavely, Governor of the Castle, and the well-known excellent management of the prison, were alone sufficient to repel the aspersions of Lee, we accompanied the publication of his petition with several documents, which completely proved the falsehood of his allegations.

"It having been insinuated, however, by some, that the evidence was all on one side, we are happy to state that Lee himself has been personally examined, and that the result has been that of indelibly stamping the allegations of his petition as false.

"At the General County Sessions, holden on 12th inst. at York, it was agreed upon, by above seventy Magistrates, that a Committee should be appointed, for the purpose of thoroughly investigating his case. He accordingly appeared, in consequence of notice sent to him express, before 15 Magistrates, who assembled at the Castle on Monday last; and who in vain endeavoured to draw from him any charge against Mr. Stavely, or against that worthy gentleman's management of the Prison, or any complaint as to the treatment received by himself while in his custody. In the face of the audacious assertions contained in his own petition, he now denied that he had ever made any complaint against Mr. Stavely, or that he had any complaint to offer: Scarce any other answer to questions could be obtained from him, but that his complaint was against those who caused his imprisonment, who were not there to vindicate themselves, and not against Mr. Stavely, who had the means of refuting his former assertions. The Magistrates, very properly, were not satisfied with those answers, but proceeded, notwithstanding, to a most strict and careful examination of the most minute charges contained in the Petition.

"The result was to the utter confusion of Lee, who cut a most despicable figure during the examination, it being ascertained beyond a doubt, that his treatment had been in every respect humane— and that the only step taken for the security of his person had been to put a single iron upon one of his legs, a precaution which the exposed situation of the gaol rendered indispensable.

Thus it is with the cases of those worthy *Patriots* when their vile fabrications are put to the  test. Contemptible as the men themselves are, we think the Members of the Legislature who have condescended to re-echo their falsehoods within the walls of Parliament have debased themselves still lower."

Sun (London) - Monday 28 July 1817

YORKSHIRE ASSIZES, Friday July 25

CROWN SIDE.

TRIAL OF LUDDITES.

*Benjamin Donkersly*, of Honley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, weaver; *Joseph Sykes*, of the same place, clothier; *Isaac Johnson*, of Holmfirth, in the same Riding, labourer; *Joshua Thewlis*, of the same place, labourer; *Abraham Oldham* and *John Oldham*, of Honley, in the same Riding, labourers; were indicted for a robbery and burglary at the house of Clement Dyson, in the said town of Honley, on the night of Sunday the 8th of June last.

Mr. Topping, Mr. Scarlett, Mr. Raine, and another Learned Gentleman, were Counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Williams, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Maude, for four of the prisoners.

Mr. Topping addressed the Jury. He described the riotous assembling of the prisoners, with others, to the number of 30 or 40, on the night specified in the indictment, the alarm they excited by their menacing and tumultuous conduct, and their general demand for arms, through the object of which they meant to accomplish after they had obtained them could not be very well guessed.— As the prisoners stood charged with burglary, in robbing the house of the prosecutrix of a gun, it was not necessary to look to the riot as connected with any political views. The outrages that were commited and threatened were no doubt violent; but, except in so far as this single robbery was the consequence of them, they were not now before the jury.

Hanna Dyson deposed, that a number of persons came to her door between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night in question; that her husband was far from home, and she was alone in the house; that they called for arms; that they knocked at the door, and not gaining admission, burst it open; that she, in consequence of their demand and threats, went and brought them a gun which she had in the house; that she gave it to one of the mob, she could not tell whom, but that she recognized Dankersly and two of the other prisoners, who were her neighbours; and saw one man with his waistcoat turned inside out, who, according to what she subsequently learned, must have been Sykes. This witness underwent a long cross-examination, for the purpose of showing that she was not to be credited in deposing to the identity of the prisoners, from the length of time she had allowed to lapse before she appeared against them (being nearly a month); from her having declared immediately after the outrage that she could not distinguish then from any of the mob; from her alleged declaration that they were all strangers to her; and from a reported saying of her's, that the trade of a witness was a very profitable thing, as she could get two guineas a day by it. She totally denied the latter report and insinuation, and accounted both for her long silence in bringing charges against her riotous neighbours, and her alleged contradictions, in saying at one time she could not identify those whom she now appeared against from motives of fear. She had seen Donkersly about nine o'clock of the night in question, making motions as if with a gun to another of the rioters, and could not be mistaken, as to him, when he appeared among the crowd that demanded arms about 12 o'clock, as he was then only three or four yards from the door. She did not know the man to whom she gave the gun, nor did she ever mention that he was one Charlesworth, though she had said that he was one of the party. The night immediately after the outrage she had told one of her neighbours, S. Hurst, than she had recognized Donkersley in the crowd. Her husband arrived from London about a fortnight after the robbery, and she was examined before the Justices at Huddersfield about a fortnight after his arrival. Her husband had been in London on law business, or to learn law. He was not in the King's Bench or the Fleet, but learning law, after he had failed as a cloth-dresser. He had been learning law for 24 weeks, but she, not being acquainted with the subject, could not tell what branch of it he practised. Being asked if he began to practise first in advising her to go before the Justices to accuse her neighbours, she answered, no, and that he did not know her business. This witness appeared to hesitate a deal in that part of her cross-examination related to what she had said to one Hobson, about her not knowing the prisoners among the party who demanded arms. Being asked if he had put the question, she answered successively "he might have done so—perhaps he did do so —yes, he did."

Samuel Winpenny, examined by Mr. SCARLETT, deposed, that he knew Isaac Johnson the prisoner; that he saw him on Sunday night, the 8th of June; that prisoner told witness he was going to a meeting about 10 or 11 o'clock, and that he requested witness to prepare himself to accompany him. Two other persons were then present, Jonathan Fallas, and Joshua Thewlis, one of the prisoners. Witness went home with Jonathan Fallas to prepare himself, but did not intend to go, and was partly undressed to go to bed when the prisoner Johnson came to inquire if he was ready. He showed a desire of remaining at home, but Johnson told him that their companions expected him, and said it would be an affair of life or death if he did not keep his assignation. On this witness acquiesced, from fear, and accompanied them as a spectator. Witness went out with Fallas, Johnson, and Thewlis, and accompanied them to a place called Far-end, where he found a number of persons assembled; with all of whom he was unacquainted, except one. The meeting might consist of between 30 or 40 persons. There was much confusion; some were for going one way, and some another, to get arms; when of the party stepped forward, and desired them to fall into the ranks, and march to Honley, which is about a quarter of a mile from Far-end. They all obeyed the order, and fell into ranks. Only six of them, had arms, and their object was to arm the rest. They went to Dyson's house and demanded arms, but witness did not know who made the demand, or who received the gun. They knocked at the door, and as it was not speedily opened, the prisoner Johnson desired to break it open. The witness heard one of the party say, that they had got  something, either gun or pistol. Witness after this returned home. He saw Johnson and Fallas afterwards, who told him the party went to several other places and demanded arms, but desired him never to mention the circumstance, as, if it were known, they would be hanged. Thewlis gave him the same charge, under the same penalty, on the Wednesday following the Sunday of the outrage. Fallas and Cocket, two of the parry, had since fled.

This witness was cross-examined by Mr. WILLIAMS, for the purpose of showing that he had previously concerted the meeting; that he had entered into the project with the same zeal as his companions; that there were no threats used of the kind he mentioned; and that he was now giving evidence against his companions to save his own life, or to promote his own advantage. It appeared that he had been taken up as one of the party on the Wednesday night after the riot; that he had been in custody ever since, and that he came to York in custody. He, however, denied that he gave evidence to save himself; that he had no hopes of doing so when he gave the information he now stated in his depositions; and that he expected then he should be put on his trial in the same manner as the rest of his companions, against whom he was hearing testimony,

Joshua Kemp deposed, on his examination for the prosecution, that he was at Honley, and remembered the circumstances of the 8th of June. In consequence of having heard from one Butterworth that there was to be a meeting, he went to join the party, and saw among them the two Oldhams, prisoners at the Bar. There were about half a score on the bridge at Honley; they went afterwards to Far-end, where they were joined by a number more, making up both together about 20 or 30 persons. Some of the *holders forth* said they should march to Huddersfield; but George Taylor, one of them, proposed they should first proceed to Honley to procure arms, mentioning houses in which they might be found. They accordingly went to Dyson's, and witness described the proceedings there nearly in the terms of the former evidence, mentioning the presence of some of the prisoners. Being cross-examined, he said that he did not see who received the gun; he knew Johnson before, and saw him at the house, in the crowd, about ten yards from the door. He saw Mrs. Dyson hand out the gun. He himself bore arms, and was active, but asked for none. He never declared that he took a pistol, or boasted of the exploit, though he received two. He was in the rear-rank when the party marched from Far-end. He was first examined on the 16th of June, being taken into custody, and had been twice afterwards examined upon oath as a witness against his companions. He had come as a prisoner to York, but, like the former witness, expected no reward for his evidence, and was not sure at first that he was free front prosecution by giving it. He confessed, however, that he thought his own neck dearer to him than that of any other man, and would be glad to save it if he could. Being asked if he was now doing his best to save it, he answered that he hoped so. He turned from being a prisoner to be a witness on the same day.

Susan Hurst was examined for the purpose of identifying Sykes, the prisoner, by giving evidence to his wearing on the night of the outrage a waistcoat turned inside out, and of proving that Mrs. Dyson, the prosecutrix had on the following day mentioned to her that she knew three of the prisoners who committed the robbery on her house. She lives next door to Sykes, and heard a rap at his door on Sunday night about 12 o'clock. She heard him coming down, and asked him next day why he did not open the door to answer the call sooner, when he said that he was in such a hurry to do so that he put on his waistcoat turned in the manner described.

The evidence for the prosecution here ended.– The prisoners being asked what they had to say in their defence, two of them gave in a written paper, the contents of which we could not distinctly hear; and the rest left their defence with their Counsel, who called several witnesses to contradict the testimony of the prosecutrix in some points, and to speak to their previous character and conduct. All these witnesses gave the prisoners an excellent character; most of them had known them from their infancy, or for a long term of years, and had never heard any thing to sully their reputation for honesty, industry, peaceable conduct, and inoffensive dispositions. One of the neighbours of the Oldhams said, he knew them from their childhood, and they were quiet honest men, who disturbed nobody. The same thing was said nearly in the same terms of the rest.

Mr. Baron Wood then summed up the evidence, pointing out its nature, and how it applied to the different prisoners.

The Jury, after consulting for a short time, returned a verdict of *Not Guilty* with regard to all.

The two Oldhams were then put to the Bar on another charge; but the prosecution calling no evidence, they were acquitted.— The verdict was heard with testimonies of satisfaction by the spectators. The Court was crowded to excess in every part. To-morrow comes on the trial of the rioters of Huddersfield, which are expected to be more interesting than the above.

### Yorkshire Summer Assizes

#### Huddersfield Plot

Friday, July 25

JOSEPH SYKES, ISAAC JOHNSON, JOSHUA THEWLIS, ABRAHAM OLDHAM, JOHN OLDHAM, and BENJAMIN DONKERSLEY, were charged together with GEORGE TAYLOR and BENJAMIN SHAW, not yet taken, and other persons unknown, with burglariously breaking into the dwelling house of Clement Dyson of Honley, on the night of the 8th of June last, and feloniously stealing and taking away one gun, value 40s.

The prisoners to this indictment, severally pleaded NOT GUILTY.

The following gentlemen were sworn of the Jury:— John Hood, Richard Baker, Thomas Sale, William Pickard, Robert John Walker, Thomas Wilberfoss, James Hebden, Robert Linsdale, Thomas Clarke, J. Matthewman, T. Ellerby, and Anthony Kitchen.

Counsel for the Prosecution— Messrs. TOPPING, RAINE, SCARLETT, and RICHARDSON.— Solicitor, Mr. LE BLANC.

Counsel for the Prisoners.— MESSRS. MAUDE, WILLIAMS and JONES.Solicitor, Mr. OVEREND.

Mr. RICHARDSON opened the indictment.

Mr. Topping stated the case on the part of the prosecution: after describing the nature of the offence, which was a burglary, he observed that this prosecution was carried on by the government; and when he had opened and proved his case, every good man would agree with him in feeling that it was of such a nature, that government would have deserted its trust if it had not submitted it to public investigation, and the decision of a Jury. It was notorious that discontent and great disturbances had existed in the western part of this county for some time; this he said not to create prejudice, or to excite their attention; the case must be determined, like all other cases, by its own evidence; and the Jury must lay out of their minds all that they had heard upon the subject out of Court. The learned Counsel proceeded to detail the nature of the evidence by which he proposed to establish the guilt of the prisoners. He concluded with stating his conviction that he was addressing a Jury who would discharge their duty honestly and firmly; that they would acquit the prisoners, if the evidence laid before them did not satisfy them that they were guilty, and do their duty by pronouncing a verdict of guilty.

The Counsel for the prosecution called the following witnesses:—

*Mrs. H. Dyson* stated, that she was the wife of Clement Dyson, and lives at Honley: Witness, on the night of the 8th of June, went to bed about nine o'clock, having previously locked and bolted the door; she was awoke by a knocking at the door, and some voices called out, "Your firelock, immediately."— Witness at first denied having one in the house, but on their threatening to knock the door in pieces, she fetched it from the garret: before she had time to get it, they had broken the door open:—one of the men just stepped with his foot into the house, and reaching out his arm, took the gun. Witness cannot speak to the person to whom she gave it, and looking after them, said "You are a set of *ludding* rogues; you will never be quiet until you are hung in a string."— One of the men said, "Turn again and blow a ball through her!" Witness said, "Feral(?), dare you?" The men were standing in two rows: there were about seven in each row. Witness saw Joseph Sykes, who came up the steps leading to her door; had his waistcoat the wrong side out, but could not say whether he had his coat on or not; she knew Sykes before. After some hesitation, witness also pointed out Benjamin Dunkersley as another of the persons she could speak to as being there:—Next morning she saw Sykes; he said to her "Have you had the men at your door to-night?" She replied, "you are like to know, you was one of them." He turned his back upon her at this, and was as white as a clout. Witness could not speak to the value of the gun; it was given to her husband the last Lud time: it was a good one, and had a good touch-hole: Sykes knew that, for he had let it off a few days before; might be worth thirty shillings.

In answer to a question from the Judge, she said the man who took the gun just put his foot into the inside of the door, and stretching out his arm took the gun.

Witness was cross-examined by Mr. MAUDE:–— Is a married woman: her husband was not at home at that time, he was in London on business; he was in the law: had been in the King's Bench prison: he came home, but witness does not remember how long ago; has taken up the law business since he returned. After some immaterial questions about her family, and the state of her dress when she gave the gun, she was asked how she knew Sykes's waistcoat, when she could speak to no other part of his dress; she said it was the pocket, and she knew the man. Witness was closely preseed to state whether she had ever said to Mr. Robinson, that she did not know of the men: she fenced a long time with the question; she would not admit at first that she could recollect having any conversation at all with him, or in his presence, upon the subject; she really did not know, really did not recollect, and really could not tell, she was so frightened; and it was not until the Judge repeatedly charged her to answer the question, the Counsel insisting either on an affirmative or negative answer, that she said, "Well, then I did say I did not know any of them, for I was afraid of my family." *(Witness had just stated that he told Sykes to his face, that he was one of them.)* Witness knows Richard Littlewood: she could not say that she ever had any conversation with him upon the subject; will swear that she never had. Knows Geo. Boothroyd, who is one of her tenants; never spoke to him on the subject: had no conversation with him: he never spoke to her upon it; is quite sure of that. Witness knows Mr. G. Hobson, who lives at Honley; had a little conversation with him about it, when he was coming from Huddersfield, where he had been examined: he asked her if she had been to swear against any of the men; witness said to him, "when I am called upon I will speak the truth, but I have not sworn to any of them."—She was examined four times at Huddersfield.

[His Lordship here enquired of Mr. Ailen, who was in Court, what had become of these examinations. Mr. Le Blanc, Solicitor to the Crown in this prosecution, said the examination to which the witness had referred, was not upon oath. His Lordship complained that the depositions of none of the witnesses had been returned to him, until she had particularly enquired for them. It was the duty of the committing Magistrate to return all the depositions, for the information of the Judge. Mr. Allen stated that Mrs. Dyson had not been examined upon oath, and with respect to the other examinations he did not know but they had been regularly returned: Mr. Allison, Solicitor, on the following day, said to the Judge, when the subject was again mentioned, that if there was any blame, it must attach to him; and the delay had arisen from his not knowing what was the usual course on these occasions, as he was not in the habit of acting as Clerk to the Magistrates.]

*Mrs. Dyson's* cross-examination having been resumed: She said she had never been a witness in that Court before—had been at York in 1815, but was not called upon—never said that it was a rare thing being a witness, and that she got two guinea a day— was examined by Mr. Jones, as Counsel for Donkersley—said she did not see Donkersley on the 8th of June until night, between nine and ten of clock, in Mr. Brook's Croft, just before it was dark: he was making motions as if he had a gun in his hand, he had nothing: another man was with him, and was walking round him; he was very near his own house–she is quite sure he was one of the persons at her lodgings that night, he was three or four yards from the door— always said that she did not know the man to whom she gave the gun— has never sworn to any person as being that man. Witness knows Charles Charlesworth, but never mentioned him as the person to whom she wave the gun, or named him as being one of the party—never said that she knew him by his voice—might mention his name to the Magistrate, but not as being one of the party, she might have been asked if she knew him and told him that if she had been as ready as he was to take up her boy, she might have charged him as being one of the men at her house, for she had given the gun to him and no one else. Witness said she was sure she never said at any time, or to anyone, that he was the man, that she knew him by his voice, nor any words to that effect—does not know when she first mentioned the name of Donkersley—she first mentioned it to an old woman, Susan Hirst, the night of the robbery; no other person was present when she mentioned it—her husband returned from London fourteen days after it happened—her first examination was a month and three days after the robbery—it was not until her husband returned that she was first examined, he had been in London nearly five weeks on law business—he never practised law before he went there—was there twenty-four weeks learning the law.

Witness, on her re-examination, said her husband is what they call an agent, he is a good writer, has written for attornies, and done businesses for them.— Mr. Le Blanc was the first man before whom she was examined.

*Samuel Winpenny* knows the prisoner Isaac Johnson; saw him in the evening of the 8th of June, when he told the witness that he must get himself ready, as there was to be a meeting that night at the Banks: saw Johnson again that night; he came to his house as he was undressing himself for bed, and said to him, "what! are you not ready?"—to which he replied, that he thought he would not go; when Johnson told him that Richard Haigh had said, that it would be either life or death if people did not go and that they would be safer there than at home; he then consented to go to Far End to look at them. Witness accompanied Johnson and the prisoner Thewlis, who was waiting at the door. There was a number of people there: he knew only Johnson, Thewlis, Cockin, Fellas, and Joseph Beaumont. There were between 30 and 40 men, of whom 7 or 8 had guns and pistols: great confusion prevailed—some being for one thing, others for another—some wishing to go to Honley, others to go home. It was at last decided to go to Honley; they marched in ranks two deep, those who had arms going foremost. The first place they demanded arms at was Wm. Heelis's House. They next went to Dyson's house; one of them demanded arms; and, as the person in the house did not immediately open the door, Isaac Johnson said, "d——n it, knock it open." Witness heard one of them say, they had got a gun, which the woman had given them, but did not see them get it: does not know whether the door was forced open or was opened from within: he left them soon after: saw Thewlis and Fellas on the Wednesday after, who told him they had gone to several other places and demanded arms. Fellas and Cockin have both absconded. Witness said the men were all crowded about the door, and were not in ranks, or in any order.

Witness was cross-examined: said he did not know any thing of the meeting before that night. He was frightened at what Johnson said, and that prompted him to go: he was only a looker-on. It is three miles from his house to Dyson's: would not have gone, but was threatened and persuaded to go: he was taken up on the Wednesday night after this happened, and has been in custody ever since: had no expectation that he should be benefited by giving his evidence.

Witness, in answer to a question from the Judge, said, on his second examination before the magistrate, he had told the same tale as he had done to-day. The examination was shown to him, which was, he said, what he had signed. He did not know it to be Dyson's house, but was told it was Donkersley's.

*J. Kemp* lives at Honley; was induced to go to the meeting by Uriah Butterworth, who told him that if he would go to Honley Bridge, he would see a great many people, as something was going to he done at Huddersfield. Witness went to Honley; saw the two Oldhams there, and half a score people on Honley Bridge: went to the Far End, near Honley, to meet the Holmfirth people: there might be between twenty and thirty. The Holmfirth people said they would not go to Huddersfield without arms, and it was agreed to go to Honley to collect them. He pointed out Johnson and the two Oldhams as being there; Abraham Oldham was armed with a gun.—Witness was one of the party at Clement Dyson's house; they went to the door, knocked, and called for arms; heard some person say, "knock the door open;" cannot tell who said this, Witness does not know who got the gun; he put his hand and foot at the inside of the door to receive it. Does not recollect seeing Johnson there. It was George Taylor that proposed they should go to Honley to collect arms.

Witness, on his cross-examination, said, he could not state that Johnson was there. He (the witness) had a gun: he took no arms from any one. Benjamin Shaw gave him two pistols, which he concealed. Shaw was one of the party. Witness was in the third rank; a person of the name of Taylor had the command; there were three in a row from Honley Bridge to Huddersfield. When witness was first examined it was as a  prisoner—he was then transferred into a witness; he did not make his disclosures with a view of becoming a witness, or of serving himself; he thought himself as bad as others; does not know whether he shall be prosecuted or not; admitted that he hoped his giving evidence would save himself, his neck being dearer to him than the neck of any other person. They were in rows when they marched towards Huddersfield; but not so when at Dyson's. His first examination took place at the White Hart Inn, Huddersfield; has been examined three times; said he did not kiss the book the first time; he was examined as a party charged, then turned into a witness, and interrogated upon oath. It was at twelve o'clock on Sunday night when he kissed the book the first time. Witness signed his name several times; he signed it every time he was examined.

*Susan Hirst* was called to prove that she heard a gentle rap at Joseph Sykes's door, on the night of the 8th of June, about twelve o'clock, and sometime after heard a person go down stairs; and that next morning Sykes told her that he could not find his clothes, and that he had put his waistcoat the wrong side out.

On her cross-examination she said, she had often talked over the matter with Mrs. Dyson, who said she could swear to three or four of the persons who were at her house. Witness is next door neighbour to Joseph Sykes.

This finished the case on the part of the prosecution.

The Prisoners being called upon for their defence left it to their Counsel.

The examination of Winpenny was then read by the permission of the Judge, on the part of the prisoners. The account given by him of the transactions of this night, varied very much from that given in Court; it was silent as to his being induced to go in consequence of intimidation, and of being frightened into it.

Kemp's examination was also read, but there was no material variation in it, from the evidence he gave in Court. Kemp being called up again by the prisoners' Counsel, stated that he remained with the party until the last. After the party had been to Dyson's they proceeded to the house of Sykes (one of the prisoners); witness did not see what passed, but the crowd said that neither Sykes nor his gun were in the house.

The four following witnesses were examined, to contradict various parts of the evidence of the wife of Clement Dyson.

*Mr. J. Robinson* lives at Honley; knows the wife of Clement Dyson, who is tenant to the witness; she was at his house on Wednesday, the 11th of June—his wife said unto her in his hearing, "You have had these people at your house I understand?"; she said they had. "Don't you know any of them?" rejoined his wife. Mrs. Dyson replied, "No, I do not know one of them—they were all strangers to me." Witness said the object of Mrs. Dyson was to ask if he had sent Sykes for a gun, which he had borrowed: he replied he had. He has known Sykes twenty years, who occasionally has been in his employment, and he always considered him as a very honest man. Witness also spoke favourably of Donkersley's character.

*Mr. George Holron* is a clothier; lives at Honley; deposed to a conversation with Dyson's wife, about Charles Charlesworth: she told the witness that he (Charlesworth) had taken up her son, for taking a hang lock from a gate; and that she had been that morning and told him that he was the man to whom she had given the gun upon the door steps, and that it was nobody else. Witness said, did not say that it was him, but that she had told him so. At another time she told the witness, that she thought she knew Sykes, Donkersley, and Shaw; and upon his asking her why she said before that she knew none of them, she replied, it was because she did not wish to have ill-will among her neighbours. He knows Sykes, Donkersley, and the two Oldhams, they have very good characters.

*Richard Littlewood* lives at Honley; conversed with Mrs. Dyson, the day after the robbery at their house; she said that she did not know any person that was there. He saw her again in the course of that week; she repeated, that she did not know any of them. Has known Sykes from a boy, and never heard any thing bad of him.

Cross-examined by Mr. Scarlett. Witness was not up that night (the 8th of June): did not hear of any thing until eight o'clock on the following morning: was not at all alarmed. He heard afterwards that there had been disturbances. Mrs. Dyson did not mention any thing of a man with his waistcoat inside out.

*George Boothroyd* is a clothier and lives at Honley; had a conversation with Mrs. Dyson about the robbery, on the Monday morning after it had taken place, between seven and eight o'clock; heard her say there had been some men at their house for a gun; and she said, the prisoner Sykes being present, she did not know one of them. Has known Sykes many years, never knew any thing bad of him.

Jonas Rowbottom, George Halliwell, William Mellor, Matthew Falkener, and James Winpenny, spoke to the characters of the different prisoners.

Mr. Scarlett proposed that Mr. Allen, one of the committing Magistrates, should be sworn to explain the examination of the witnesses, Winpenny and Kemp.

Mr. Baron Wood said he could not receive evidence to that effect. The examinations must speak for themselves.

His Lordship, in charging the Jury said, it was clear that very great outrages had occurred in the district where this offence was stated to have been committed: that there had been an assemblage at men armed with guns and other offensive weapons, was also clear, but for what purpose did not appear from the evidence, though there could be no doubt that it was for a purpose altogether illegal; it was equally clear that it was the duty of the Magistrates to suppress those outrages, and to endeavour to apprehend the persons engaged in them, and that this was an investigation and enquiry which it was highly proper for government to institute, It was, however, the duty of the Court and of the Jury to confine their attention to the case before them; nor should they suffer their minds to be prejudiced by any thing that had taken place, or that they might have heard out of Court. The offence must be brought home to the prisoners by legitimate evidence or they must be acquitted. The crime with which they stood charged was that of burglariously breaking into and stealing in a dwelling-house in the night time; and to render a person guilty of this offence, it was not necessary that he should be the person who actually entered the house or who received the goods; it was sufficient if he was present, or near enough to aid, comfort, and afford assistance to the persons engaged in the offence. No questions of law could arise in the case. If the prisoners were present at the time, and with the person who committed the robbery (being in the night time) they would be guilty of the offence imputed to them by the indictment. He should proceed to state the evidence which had been given by the Crown and for the prisoners. The testimony of Hannah Dyson, his Lordship observed, had been materially impeached by the witnesses for the prisoner. Her evidence was given in a manner which could not have escaped the notice of the Jury. It was a long time before she would give answer any to the questions put to her by the Counsel for the prisoners—she at first denied having had any conversation with Mr. Robinson upon the subject— then said she could not recollect—and at last admitted that she had held such a conversation—that he did ask a question, and that she answered that she did not know any of the men. She also denied having had any conversation with Littlewood and with George Boothroyd, in which also she was flatly contradicted. It was also a singular circumstance that she should take upon her to speak with so much certainty to Joseph Sykes having had his waistcoat on the wrong side, and yet should have taken so little notice as not to know what sort of a coat he had on, or whether he had any coat or not. She also represented the men who were at her door as ranged in ranks in regular order, but Winpenny expressly stated that they all crowded together. His Lordship, in commenting on the threatening language used by Mrs. Dyson towards Charles Charlesworth, said "what kind of a woman must she be to say, she could charge him with receiving the gun from her, when she stated on her oath, that she did not know to whom she gave it, it, *(sic)* and this because he had given her offence in taking up her son. She must be a bad women to use such a threat." With respect to the two witnesses for the Crown, Wimpenny and Kemp, they stood in the situation of accomplices, and as such, though competent witnesses were not entitled to credit unless materially confirmed—a confirmation which they could not receive from the evidence of the first witness, which itself required to be confirmed. In addition to this drawback arising from their situation as accomplices, the testimony of Winpenny was inconsistent with a prior account he had given upon oath of the particulars of his conduct with respect to the transactions of this night. In his testimony to-day, he had represented himself as engaging unwillingly in the burglary—as being threatened and frightened into it. In his examination before the magistrates there is not a word of all this; on the contrary it appears that he engaged voluntarily in it—that he was a member of the Society—that he contributed money to its support, and that he had previously agreed to go to the scene of depredation. On the evidence of Kemp, his Lordship said it was not inconsistent with his former examination. He did not mention Sykes as being present, and it would rather follow from his evidence that he was not supposed to be there by the party, because when they went to Sykes's house, it was said that neither he or his gun was in the house; and they would hardly have expected to find him there if he was with them at the time. After going through the whole of the evidence, his Lordship concluded his charge in nearly the following terms:—This, gentlemen, is the whole of the evidence on both sides; I have before stated the law upon the subject, and if you shall be satisfied from the evidence, that the prisoners, all of them, or any of them, were present when the door of Dyson's house was broken open as stated by the first witness, all of them, or such of them as were so present, will be guilty of the charge imputed to them by the present indictment. The question for your consideration then is, were the prisoners present when the robbery took place? The main witness in support of the charge, is Mrs. Dyson, you have heard the evidence she has given. and the manner in which she has given it, and the degree in which it has been contradicted. The evidence of the other two witnesses you will consider with reference to their situation as accomplices, and the inconsistency which I have stated in the evidence of the former with his previous depositions. These are the observations I have thought it right to make; to which I will add that the prisoners have had good characters given them. If, taking the whole of the case and the evidence into your consideration, you think that the charge is made out against the prisoners, and that the facts are established to your satisfaction, you will find the prisoners guilty. If the evidence should leave it as a matter of doubt, you will then suffer character to have its weight to turn the scale in their favour, and in that case you will acquit them.
  
The Jury turned round in their box for a few moments, and then pronounced all the prisoners NOT GUILTY.

SATURDAY JULY 26

TRIAL OF LOCKWOOD and OTHERS,  
*for Malicious Shooting.*

BENJAMIN LOCKWOOD, GEO. WOFFENDEN, JOHN WILSON and JOSEF JYSOP, were charged together with JOSEPH JYSOP and BENJAMIN DYSON, (not in custody) with aiding and abetting a certain person unknown, in firing a loaded gun or pistol with an intent to kill, maim, disable, or do some grievous bodily harm to David Alexander, on the night of the 8th of June last.

The following Gentlemen were sworn of the Jury: Thomas Barker. George Alder, George Stelling, John Nicholson, Willian Ronsley, George Addison, John Dinsley, John Carling, James Featherstone, Christopher Robinson, Joseph Smith, and Anthony Kitchen.

Counsel for the Prosecution— Messrs. TOPPING, RAINE, SCARLETT, and RICHARDSON.— Solicitor, Mr. LE BLANC.

Counsel for the Prisoners— Messrs. WILLIAMS and STARKIE.— Solicitor, Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. Richardson opened the indictment.

Mr. TOPPING addressed the Jury.—He said, whatever might be the issue of that trial, it was an investigation which it was the imperious duty of the government to institute: he did not enter into any general history of the discontents in this part of the West-Riding, nor did he assign any object for the armed assemblage the proceedings of which formed the subject of the present indictments. The following witnesses were called on the part of the prosecution.

*Captain John Armitage* is the commander of the Huddersfield yeomanry Cavalry; was at Huddersfield on the 8th of June; he was called up late at night, and had some information communicated to him, which induced him to go, accompanied by six privates of his corps and the constable (Whitehead) to a place called Engine Bridge (also called Folly-hall Bridge.) David Alexander and Shires were in the advance, and rode about fifty yards before the rest of the party, when they arrived near the bridge, witness had almost lost sight of Alexander, and immediately he heard some of the party say, they have halted. Witness then rode within a few yards of the advance, and found they were halted. Witness, on account of the darkness of the night, could not exactly say how far they were from the bridge; not more than a few yards. He heard Alexander say here they are; his attention was directed forwards, and he saw a party of persons assembled on the bridge; he could not distinguish that they had arms, except from the firing. Witness called out the constable from the rear, and directed him to go and speak to them; he came up; and as soon as he approached them, he saw a gun flash in the pan. He (the witness) heard a few words said by Whitehead before he saw this, but could not distinguish them, and he could not be quite positive. The flash proceeded from the party on the bridge; no report followed the flash. The next moment, several other guns were fired from the party assembled on the bridge; could see from the light made by the firing, that the guns were directed towards his party; twenty guns at least were fired; the firing was irregular; three or four appeared to be fired rather in a volley; on the whole, he should say the firing was irregular. We remained there (continued the witness) until ten shots were fired. He looked forward to see, by the light of the firing, what numbers were assembled; the party were rather on the fall of the bridge on the other side: could not see immediately over the heads of the men who were nearest him, so as to discover whether the space immediately behind them was occupied; but forty or fifty yards beyond the bridge, he saw a moving mass of people, but could not ascertain the number; if the whole space to the bridge was occupied, as he thought it was, the number must have been very considerable:— under these circumstances, he thought it improper to risk the lives of his small party, and they retired upon a larger force he had in the town of Huddersfield; but on his return with a more considerable force, the party had entirely dispersed. Mr. Alexander was mounted on a grey horse. Engine Bridge is about a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield.

*George Whitehead* is the deputy constable of Huddersfield; went with Captain Armitage and six privates on the night of the 8th of June last, to Engine Bridge; got there between twelve and one; when they arrived near the bridge, Captain Armitage ordered the party to halt, and desired the witness to go to the front and enquire what they wanted? By *they*, he understood the mob, who were assembled on the bridge. Witness could see a number of persons assembled on the bridge; he went within about ten yards from them: one of the persons presented his piece at him: by the flash of the pan he could see that it was a firelock. One of the party on the bridge called out, "Who comes there?" Witness answered "What are you doing there?" No answer was made by the mob, but a firing commenced from them immediately, without anything more being said. It came from the centre of the bridge; it was so dark, that he could not state what the direction of the firing was. Witness could not speak to any of the other pieces; five shots were fired before he turned his horse's head round to go back; all the firing was from the bridge. This witness was moving down in a straight line to the bridge, until he halted, when he was opposite to it at the foot. After he had commenced a retreat, other shots were fired. David Alexander was in the rear of the witness, and within a yard of his horse; he was coming in the same direction, until he halted; and the rest of the party were a little behind; there were upwards of *four hundred* persons assembled. The house of George Dawson was about 10 or 15 yards from the bridge; witness was within 10 yards of it; Dawson's house was behind him to the right, and descended from the road by a few steps; witness was nearly in a line with Dawson's house. The next morning he examined a house on the roadside, near the bridge, which appeared to him to have been struck by a bullet, part of the stone and lime having been driven off; it was the house adjoining Dawson's but nearer the bridge: the mark of the ball was nearly in the direction of it. Alexander was on his right hand, within about six or seven yards of the house.

Witness was cross-examined by Mr. Williams. He said he had made diligent search after the persons supposed to be assembled on the bridge, and he ascertained that from forty to fifty persons had absconded, for some of whom he was making search, and against whom he had grounds of suspicion. Witness might be ten yards from the bridge when the first firing took place; no obstruction between him and the bridge; he observed stone walls on each side the road as he advanced to the bridge; the width of the road was less than eight yards; there are some houses which form part of eight yards; there are some houses which form part of the line to the bridge. Witness rode a bay horse. Alexander's horse was a grey, which he supposed would be better to see in the dark than his horse, and that nothing was so likely to be seen by the party on the bridge. It was impossible to observe in what direction the firing was, or in what position the guns were pointed. Witness was the prosecutor in another indictment against the prisoners: was before the Grand Jury twice, once on a bill for shooting at himself, which was thrown out.

Witness was re-examined by Mr. Scarlett. Did not know whether the cavalry had their swords drawn, but they had their pistols out; witness could not say whether the persons on the bridge might have seen his party by the flash of the gun. The firing was after the conversation he had stated. The stone walls are only of the height of four or five feet, and are on lower ground than the road. Alexander's horse was as likely as anything to mark where his party was.

*David Alexander* is one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, was such on the 8th of June last, and was one of the party who went to Engine Bridge; had a pistol in his hand; rode a grey horse; was a little in advance of his party; and when he got within a few yards of the bridge he saw a number of men there, which induced him to halt—there appeared to be between sixty and seventy; none of them, he thought, were dressed in light-coloured clothes. Capt. Armitage ordered the constable to advance. Witness saw a piece presented, which flashed in the pan. They (the persons on the bridge) said, "Who comes there?" This was asked before the constable spoke; who said, "What do you want there?" The next thing that he saw was a flash; he could not tell whether it came from a gun or pistol. Another piece went off; it came from the end of the bridge where the mob were standing. Several more pieces were fired: his horse reeled backwards about the time the third shot was fired. After several shots had been fired, his party retreated. Witness went out again, after they got to Huddersfield; but on their arrival at Engine Bridge, the mob had dispersed.— Witness, on his return to Huddersfield the second time, examined his horse, and found that it was wounded in the forehead with a ball, which was extracted: it was a lead pistol ball, which witness produced, and was sworn to by the Court and Jury. He could not tell what it had been fired from. Witness, on the following day, examined the houses near the bridge, one of which had the appearance of being struck by a ball, a small piece of stone and lime having been knocked out: could see no appearance of the lead. This mark was two yards or eight feet above the level of the road: would be about the same height as his head when he was on horseback. At the time he observed his horse to reel his head was towards the bridge. When he examined his horse he found the blood running down his forehead: first knew that his horse was wounded after he got back the first time; saw the wound, and the ball which was taken out of its head. On his party retiring from Engine Bridge, there were some shots fired after them. The uniform is blue, turned up with buff.

Witness was cross-examined by Mr. STARKIE. He said he thought it was impossible for a stone to have produced the mark on the house near the bridge; a large stone would have made a greater hole, and a small stone could not have been thrown with sufficient force: the mark was also round. Witness was not the first to discover that his horse was wounded; it was pointed out to him. There was other firing that night, but it was at the distance of one mile and a half. Witness was not the first to discharge his pistol; did not fire it until the third shot: is sure that he did not fire first. He fired his pistol when he was at the distance of about twenty yards. His horse could not have been wounded from his own shot; he fired his pistol about the same time that he felt his horse to reel. His horse had been accustomed to stand fire. but had not been in action before. Witness was fired at between the bridge and Huddersfield.

In answer to a question from the Judge, he said he had been fired at before he went to Engine Bridge, between the bridge and Huddersfield. About a quarter past eleven o'clock he was going for his horse; he put the bridle on after that; is sure the horse was not wounded when he left Huddersfield.

*Nathan Taylor* lives at Well Green, a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield: is a married man and a householder. On Sunday, the 8th of June, he went to bed about ten o'clock, and was called up again about one o'clock by some men who were calling and making a noise at the door: they said if he did not get up immediately, they would break it open. Witness then got up and opened the door, and found two men standing there; they had each of them a gun; they insisted on the witness immediately dressing himself; they came into the inside of the house and told him he was to go with them; he asked them several times "Where to," but they would not tell him. His wife then asked them, and they said they were going to take him to Huddersfield; the witness did not ask for what purpose; he dressed himself, but did not go voluntarily; he went very much against his will; he accompanied these two men. Before they left the house, there was a call from Well Green; witness believes Benjamin Lockwood was one of the two persons. He went with them three-quarters of a mile, to a place called Knowl Hill; when he got to Knowl Lane, he found three or four persons in a field which lies between Yew Green and Engine Bridge. This field was about a quarter of a mile from the bridge, and lies near the road, on the left hand, between Lockwood and Huddersfield, and about a quarter of a mile from Engine Bridge; when he got there, between twelve and one o'clock, he went up to the men; one of them had a gun; he did not see any other guns; saw two scythes under a wall, about 12 yards from the men; they were not in the possession of any of them. William Crowther and witness made their escape, and he knows no more about the business.

Witness was cross-examined by Mr. STARKIE:— He said he could not safely swear that the prisoner, Lockwood, was one of the persons who came to his house, as it was dark.

Re-examined by Mr. TOPPING. - Walked with the two persons three quarters of a mile to Knowl Field. Being asked whether, on his examination, he had not spoken more positively, he said he had been told that Lockwood had confessed. In his evidence given today, he had said he *believed* that Lockwood was one of the men; he would not swear that he was one of them. "I think it is him; I cannot swear it is him." Lockwood was a cropper at Woodhouse; lives a quarter of a mile from the witness; has known him personally about a year; has seen Lockwood up and down in Woodhouse, and frequently at the tenters.— Witness is a shoemaker.

*George Armytage* examined by Mr. SCARLETT.— Is a shoemaker: knows Engine Bridge. On the 8th of June, witness had been to Lockwood "*a-courting*," and was returning to Huddersfield between twelve and one o'clock. When he came near Engine Bridge, he was stopped by two men who presented a gun at him; a young man (Charles Hearnshaw) was with him; two guns were presented at them; the men said, "come over into the field"; the other chap said, "what to do?" They answered that they wanted to see how many they could muster that night. Hearnshaw said to the witness, "Must we, Armytage?" The men then replied, "if you do not come over, we will shoot you"; they then forced witness and his companion over the wall and drove them up the field; it was then a quarter past twelve o'clock. They found a crowd of people; there were two handkerchiefs upon the wall, which appeared to have something in them; the people made answer and said, "you that have arms, come close to the wall"; saw some persons with arms; some had guns and some had pistols; cannot say how many, but he saw eight or nine guns and pistols; some of the people went to the wall; and he saw a man put his hand into a handkerchief and take out a square lump, which he gave to a man, who, when he came away, said, "He had got twelve rounds."

[This examination was interrupted by the Counsel for the prisoners, who contended that they could not enter into evidence of what was done at this place until they had proved the prisoners were there. The narrative was then suspended by examining the witness as to this fact, who said that he saw John Wilson, George Woffenden, Benjamin Lockwood, and the other prisoner, Jysop, whose name he did not then know, on the field or the bridge.] Witness proceeded, and repeated, that one man got a square lump, and said he had got twelve rounds. Did not see what was in the handkerchiefs; there was a lump as large as his hat in each of them; those who had arms went towards the wall: knows Joseph Croft. He was at the bridge:— when they had done in the field, some of them said they must go down to the other people, and they went down the hill to the bridge. Witness and Earnshaw wished to go away but were prevented, and they went to the bridge to pass over, but were stopped by two men who stood at the end of the bridge with scythes and guarded it to keep any person from going over. Jysop was one of the men who had scythes at the foot of the bridge. Joseph Croft appeared to have the command; he told them to kneel down, and the men who had arms were ranged on each side of the road, and they knelt on their right knee, opposite each other; this was upon the bridge, and their faces were turned towards Huddersfield. George Woffenden and Benjamin Lockwood had guns; John Wilson had something in his hand, but at first, he did not see what it was. When the men were kneeling, the cavalry came up; he heard the sound of the horses' feet. Croft called out, "Who comes there?" and then cried, fire.— Witness was not upon the bridge at that time; he heard the people say there were five of the cavalry; witness was then running away towards Lockwood; one single gun went off first, and then there were a great many fired. Woffenden and Wilson had each of them guns and were upon the bridge; Jysop had a scythe upon the bridge; he was there before the firing commenced; did not see Wilson have a pistol until the people were dispersing, about 25 yards from the bridge when a gun went off at the top of Taylor Hill. One of the party said, have you nothing to answer it with? on which, Wilson fired his pistol off; this was about five minutes after they had left the bridge. Witness said he returned to Lockwood, intending to go again to his sweetheart, but she would not open the door.— Witness lives at Huddersfield, but he did not like to go there that night.

Witness was cross-examined at great length by Mr. WILLIAMS; he said he was a shoemaker; knows Knowl-Hill, which is the field he has been mentioning: when he saw these four men, he did not see them in that field; saw John Wilson in the field, three of them he did not see that night until he went to the bridge; he was guarded down to it by a body of men and went against his will— he was going to Huddersfield, and when he got to the crown of the bridge, two men prevented him from going over; they made a guard upon it by two scythes. For anything that the witness knows, the four persons of whom he had spoken might have been compelled to join the people on the bridge, as well as the witness and his companion Earnshaw, who was also detained against his will. Earnshaw and himself have been together a good deal since that time, were in custody five weeks were a week in the Castle, witness has not had handcuffs on; both he and Earnshaw came out of the Castle that morning— he has had no conversation with Earnshaw on the subject— does not know whether the cavalry or the party on the bridge fired first, the single piece was first fired. *Witness never said to anyone that he knew none of the people in the field*, and never heard a word of the meeting until he was stopped upon the bridge: he remembers the 13th regiment of dragoons coming to Huddersfield, he did not go to look at them, but was there, at the corner of the market place. Witness does not know whether he saw Wm. Stanley on that occasion; but he did not say to him that day, "that he (the witness) was not there (at Engine Bridge);" said something about the grass in his father's field being trodden down—does not recollect any person saying to him "thou must have been there George," nor does he recollect saying "no" or "I was not there." After the question had been repeated several times he said he could not say whether he had said so or not. Being asked if he had not talked at Huddersfield about his father's field being trodden down, he said he could not answer that.Being asked if he did not say, "By G-d, I was not there— said he could not recollect saying such a word.— When much pressed he said he did not say, by G-d, and does not recollect saying the rest of the sentence: He however would not positively swear that he did not say it; he knows that there is a person named Blaydes at Huddersfield, but does not know him, nor that he said these words in his presence; if he did, they have slipped his memory; neither does he ever recollect saying them. Witness knows James Drake; he did tell him that he had been there, but he did not say he knew any man that was there, for he was afraid of being shot. He gave the information at last to the Magistrates because he always meant to tell of the people.

*Capt. Armitage* was again called and stated, that he was quite sure the first firing was from the party on the bridge.

This finished the evidence on the part of the Crown.

Mr. Baron Wood said this was the time for the prisoners to make their defence.

The prisoners said they left their defence to their counsel.

The following witnesses were then called on their behalf:–

*Mr. Wm. Stanley* lives at Huddersfield, is a shoe-maker; remembers the dragoons coming into Huddersfield, it rained at the time, and he retired into a passage for shelter; it was the day after the disturbances; Blaydes, and a publican of the name of Dunn, were there, and three other persons he did not know. The passage is near the market-place; he knows Geo. Armytage, (the last witness for the prosecution,) very well, and has known him from a child; whilst he was standing, Armytage came into the passage—there was some conversation about the disturbances the preceding day, and about the dragoons coming into the town; when Armytage said, "his father's field was trodden down, and there was hardly a blade of grass standing;" he said there were many hundreds upon it. Witness said to him, "George, did thou see them?" Armytage replied, "No I did not see them." and here the conversation ended with Armytage; and the witness then talked with the other persons.

*James Drake* stated that he was a cloth dresser at Huddersfield; had some conversation with George Armytage, on the Friday following the disturbances, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in Mr. Downing's stables; there was another young man present at the same time, who lives with Mr. Downing, of the name of Reynolds; they were talking about what had happened at Engine Bridge, when George Armytage said, *"he did not know one person that was there."*

Witness on his cross-examination said that he was a cloth-dresser, and lived at Huddersfield, was not intimate with Armytage; he told him he had been courting a young woman, and on coming back was forced into a field, and told him what he had seen; he said he turned back as soon as he could, and when he had got a distance from them, he heard a few pieces go off. Armytage told him this as a secret, and he was not to mention it to any one; he did not tell the witness his reason for keeping it a secret; he did not say it was for fear of being shot, or that he was afraid of being shot. Witness said he knew his reason, which was, that he was afraid of being taken up. Witness communicated this conversation to his father on the following day. Mr. Alexander, the attorney for the prisoner, sent for him the last Friday but one, and he then told him of it: he also told it to many persons besides his father. After Armytage was taken into custody, he knew he was to be a witness; knows John Wilson, has known him five or six years; supposes Wilson's father, or some other person, had heard what he could say, and had communicated it to Mr. Alexander.

Witness, on his re-examination, said he did not promise to keep it a secret, and that Armytage did not seem to be under any apprehension, and that he was quite hardened.

*John Blaydes* is a tailor, at Huddersfield; he lives at the bottom end of the town; saw Armytage in the market-place; was in the passage, remembers George Armytage coming in, 8 or 10 persons were taking shelter in it. The persons there were talking about the disturbances, witness took no part in the conversation; he heard Armytage say that he had been at his father's field, (which he supposes to be at Engine Bridge) he said they had made such work among the grass as was shameful to be seen; he said, he believed there had been between three or four hundred people in the field; witness said, upon hearing this, W. Stanley made a remark and asked him if he had been there, he said "no he would be d———d if he had been there;" he said nothing more that he knew of.

On being cross-examined, witness said he heard of Armytage being taken up, but does not recollect the time when he first heard of it; is sure that Wm. Stanley said, thou hast been there thyself George, and that his answer was that he had not been there.

*Mr. James Woodhouse* has known Benjamin Lockwood five years, his character was very good, he was 19 years of age, and was apprentice with the witness.

*Eli Dyson* lives at Well-Green, has known George Woffenden ten years and upwards; his general character has been very good; he was a sober young man, avoided had company, attended religious worship, paying due respect to his mother; his father being dead from his infancy. Being asked by the Counsel if his conduct had been good towards all others of his Majesty's subjects? he answered, it had— his general conduct had been good.

*Mr. John Thornton* had known George Woffenden ever since he was born, and during the whole time he always considered him as a good, honest, sober lad, very peaceable, and was never found in a fray before. Has served witness and his brother five or six years.

*Mr. Wm. Milnes* has also known the prisoner Woffenden ever since he was born, and he really deserves the character given him; he never knew him in an affray before.

*Edward Dixon* has known John Wilson ever since he was born, his character is good, has been dutiful from his childhood, and is a peacable, well-behaved young man.

*Mr. John Blaydes* has known Wilson since he was a child, has heard the character given him by the last witness, which he deserves and his general character was very good all through Huddersfield.

Mr. Baron WOOD proceeded to charge the Jury. He said this was an indictment against the prisoners charging them with aiding and abetting a person unknown in discharging a gun, or other fire-arms, at David Alexander, with intent to kill, maim, disable, or do some other grievous bodily harm to the said David Alexander. His Lordship said, it had been clearly proved that there had been some very grievous outrages committed on this occasion: that a great number of persons armed had collected together, at the place spoken to by the witnesses, for a purpose which had not been stated in evidence but which could not be otherwise than illegal; and he thought it was the duty of the government to institute a legal inquiry into these transactions. His Lordship also said, that he agreed in the law, as laid down by the Counsel for the prosecution, that it was not necessary to prove either that the prisoners were any of them the *(sic)* had that fired the gun, or that the person who fired it had an intention to shoot the individual named in the indictment. It was sufficient to establish the charge, if the prisoners were proved to be unlawfully assembled with the person that fired the gun; and, by that presence, were aiding and assisting the person so firing. And if it was fired with the intention of killing, or of doing any grievous bodily harm to any of his Majesty's subjects, it might be considered as being the intention to kill or disable the person named in the indictment. If a person wilfully discharged a gun among a body people, without singling out any one individual may be considered and laid as fired with an intent to kill, maim, or disable all or any of them. But deciding upon the case before the Jury, they would consider whether the prisoners were present on that occasion: and that was the main question the Jury would have to try; because if they were there voluntarily they must be considered as concurring in all the acts that were done at that assemblage. His Lordship then proceeded to detail the evidence, as given in the preceding statement; having concluded, he said, the tumultuous assemblage and the firing, were sufficiently proved; but there were only two witnesses who at all brought the charge home to any of the prisoners: the first of these, Taylor, spoke to the person of Benjamin Lockwood; but on his evidence it would be impossible for the Jury safely to rely with respect to this prisoner, because the witness would not take upon him to say positively that he was one of the persons who called upon him, and though the Counsel for the prosecution endeavoured to show, by cross-examination, that he must have well known the prisoner, still, if the Jury should be convinced that he did not speak the truth, when he said, he was not sure that he was the person— whose reliance could they place upon his saying, that he believed he was the person? If his testimony was false in the former case, it would be unworthy of credit in the latter. The whole of the case then against the prisoners rested upon the unsupported testimony of witness George Armytage, whose credit had been materially shaken by the evidence of respectable witnesses on the part of the prisoners. This witness had repeatedly denied having made certain declarations respecting this transaction, which he was clearly proved to have made, and of which he could not be ignorant: and this was the only evidence of the prisoners having been at Engine Bridge, where this meeting was held. It would be for the Jury to say whether they could convict the prisoners upon it. There was another circumstance deserving of the serious consideration of the Jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness: he had been in the custody of the prosecutors; he was then at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present and to have seen all the circumstances that he had asserted in evidence, and yet he is not produced. The Jury would draw their own inference from this strong fact. His Lordship thought it was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness. His Lordship further stated that if, in considering the evidence, the Jury thought it a matter of reasonable doubt, the good character given the prisoners should incline the scale in their favour. It was a case which deserved their serious consideration; and he had no doubt that their verdict would be such as the justice of the case required.

The Jury retired for about a quarter of an hour and, on their return into Court, pronounced all the prisoners— NOT GUILTY.

*The Judge*— "Prisoners at the bar, Take care of yourselves for the future. You have now had a very narrow estape, and if you persist in such practices as these, you may depend upon it you will bring yourselves to an untimely end. Have a care of your future Conduct."

*Prisoners*,— "We will, indeed."

*No Bills* being found against

Jonathan Baily, clothier, aged 25, Pog-Ing.  
Jonathan Brook, cloth dresser, 28, Meltham.  
John Kinder, cloth dresser, 41, Honley.  
Benjamin Taylor, fancy-weaver, 24, Honley.  
Benjamin Brook, weaver, 18, Salford, in Lockwood  
Joseph Beaumont, cloth dresser, 23, Lockwood.  
Wm. Crowther, shoe-taker, 17, Lockwood.  
Benjamin Green, cloth dresser, 22, Honley.  
Joseph Haigh, weaver, 20, Berrybrow, Almondbury.  
James Oldham, cloth dresser, 20, Berrybrow.  
John Oldfield, weaver, 32, Almondbury.  
Abraham Oldfield, weaver, 31, Almondbury.  
they were all discharged.

John Rhodes, against whom a Bill has been found for a misdemeanour only, having traversed to the next Assizes, is liberated on bail.

The Court was extremely crowded, and Earl Fitzwilliam, the Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding, was present.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817

### THE MERCURY.

The trials of the State prisoners, as they have been pompously called, closed at York last Saturday; and the four-and-twenty persons against whom the Government solicitor was instructed to institute prosecutions, ten have been pronounced not guilty; against eleven others no bills were found; and one has been liberated on bail; leaving only two in the whole number in Confinement, and those two unfortunate men have been detained, without trial, by a Secretary of State's warrant, under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Thus ends the Yorkshire plot!

The failure of these prosecutions has not been owing to any want of zeal, or deficiency of means, on the part of the Government. Some time before the trials came on, the Solicitor for the Crown was sent down into the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to collect evidence against the prisoners ;— in support of this evidence, a large portion of the weight and talent of the bar, on the northern circuit, was ranged on the side of the prosecution— and that nothing might be wanting to give importance to these proceedings, Mr. GURNEY was sent down from London, at the expense of Government, to take reports of the trials, for the perusal, we presume, of his Majesty's Ministers. Against all this weight of power and influence, seconded by the public purse, a few obscure men and boys, principally in the very lowest ranks in society, had to defend themselves. The odds were terrific; but with the zeal and intelligence of their professional advisers and advocates, and the presiding presence of a righteous Judge, who knows no distinction between the lofty and the humble, in the administration of justice, the trial by Jury obtained another distinguished triumph, and the prisoners, after a period of deep anxiety, were restored to their liberty and to their friends.

While we speak of the *zeal* manifested by the persons officially engaged in the trials of the prisoners, we cannot but regret that the Judge should have had occasion complain, in the presence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Haigh, the committing magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the magistrates required, till had made particular inquiry for them. The upright mind of Baron Wood, it was evident, felt wounded by this proceeding, and any thing like reluctance to give to the accused all the advantages any discrepancy between the original examination of a witness and his evidence before the Court, will always be viewed with suspicion by a people jealous of their privileges, and anxious in the highest degree to preserve the stream of public justice free from contamination. The apology made for this suspicious omission by Mr. Le Blanc, the solicitor for the Crown, must be felt by every lover of justice to be extremely unsatisfactory. Some of the examinations, he says, were not taken on oath: but that surely is no reason why the others should be withheld !—and why, we should be glad to know, were examinations involving the liberty and lives of many of our countrymen not taken in the usual and authorised way? Mr. Allison, the clerk to the Huddersfield magistrates, and the professional coadjutor of the Crown solicitor in these prosecutions, might have instructed Mr. Allen's inexperience. Though his modesty may not allow it, the people of Huddersfield, and the professional gentlemen of the county of York, well know that there are few gentlemen in their profession better acquainted with the duties of a magistrate's law-clerk, or who has had more experience in criminal matters, than Mr. Allison. If our memory does not fail us, this gentleman acted as law-clerk to Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Radcliffe, during the whole of the disturbances in 1812, when no fewer than 64 persons were committed to York-castle, and when 17 of that number were capitally convicted. Inexperience, therefore, is out of the question; but supposing this to have been the case, the public will naturally inquire, whether Mr. Le Blanc is also inexperienced? and why he who had the chief direction of the prosecution did not order the depositions to be laid before the Judge? These documents were, however tardily, at length produced, and the penetrating eye of Baron Wood soon discovered that Samuel Winpenny had sworn one thing before the magistrates, and another before the Court; and this contradiction on a point of essential importance was very properly deemed by his Lordship fatal to the witness's testimony.

As to the conduct of the Government, in instituting these prosecutions, if we had not substantial reason for believing that the crimes imputed to the prisoners were instigated by a spy agency, which first entraps and then betrays, we should have held the prosecutions to be extremely laudable. That nothing appeared on the trials to couple Mr. Oliver's name with these lawless transactions is true, and for the best possible reason— it was the policy and the interest of both parties to keep that pestiferous agent out of sight. The prosecutors would not, of course, introduce him to the notice of the Jury; and the counsel for the prisoners, while it was their duty to maintain that their clients were free from guilt, necessarily avoided the slightest mention of any union between the accused and the reputed instigator of the crimes with which they stood charged. The situation of both parties will, therefore, satisfactorily account for the perfect silence that prevailed respecting Mr. Oliver; but had it been necessary to show, by evidence, that this Spy had been in communication with the leaders of the sedition, and that he had "aided, counselled, and comforted" them, that evidence was at hand.

We readily admit that the offences clearly proved to have been committed in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th of June, called for legal investigation: but, while we deprecate popular tumult and violence, in every shape, and call for punishment upon the lawless, we shall always, in the benign spirit of the English law, claim for the accused candour and fair-dealing on the part of the public prosecutor. *Justice*, rather than *Conviction*, ought to be the object of the Government, and of all the persons acting under their directions and authority.

We have been led into these observations by a circumstance of a very extraordinary nature that has come to our knowledge, and which bears a striking affinity the case of McKinle, so recently before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh: but before we proceed to state the facts to which we allude, it may be proper, for the perfect understanding of the subject, to quote the words of Baron Wood, in his charge to the Jury, on the trial of Benjamin Lockwood and others, for maliciously, shooting at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield yeomanry cavalry, on the night the 8th of June. After adverting to the testimony George Armytage, one of the witnesses for the Crown, who had sworn that he and a person of the name of Earnshaw, or Hearnshaw, had been forced to join the rioters at Folly-hall-bridge, his Lordship said—— "There is another circumstance deserving the serious consideration of the jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness. He has been in the custody of the prosecutors; he is now at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present, and to have seen all the circumstances that Armytage has asserted in evidence; and yet he is not produced! The Jury will draw their own inferences from this strong fact. It was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness."

Upon this text of Mr. Baron Wood, the following declaration of Charles Hearnshaw, the witness referred to, furnishes the alarming comment: we publish the document, *verbatim*, as it has been sent to us, [with the exception of one word used sportively by the Grand Jury], chusing rather to retain even the grammatical inaccuracies, than to make any alterations in the paper itself:—

DECLARATION OF CHARLES HEARNSHAW

Transmitted for Publication from Huddersfield, on Thursday, the 31st of July, 1817:—

"I was examined, the 21st of June, by Mr. B. Allen, Magistrate, concerning the Folly-hall fight:— He asked if I could tell him who fir'd first? I told him the cavalry fir'd first, at the Folly Hall Bridge, on the 8th of June. Mr. Allen told me I was mistaken, it was a gun in Manchester-street that I heard. I told him it was not a gun Manchester-street, it was the gentlemen cavalry: I was certain of it: but they would not put that in my examination. When I was going to be examined by the grand jury, at York, Mr. Thomas Atkinson came to me, and asked me, if would do him a favour? I asked him what it was? He said, he could wish me to say the mob fir'd first and bought a shilling's worth of oranges; and he told me if did not say the mob fired first, I should have four or five evidences against me, namely, Mr. T. Atkinson, Mr. David Alexander, Mr. Allen the magistrate, and George Whitehead the constable. I told the grand jury the truth; I told them the cavalry fired first, and I told them the ball wiz'd close by my head.—They asked me if I was not afraid: I told them I was not. I told them, then, there was about eight or nine of the mob fired, and immediately the cavalry galloped off. The Grand Jury said, they was——, and laugh'd. Saturday, the 26th, a gentleman from London sent for me, Mr. Liblong, Solicitor for the Crown, I think they call'd him, and he asked me what I meant to say when I got into the Court? I told him I meant to speak the truth; I told him I meant to say that the cavalry fir'd first. He told me I was a damned lieing rascal, and said I had had conversation with Buckley, and he had persuaded me to say so. He asked me if I could not as well say the mob fir'd first, say the cavalry fir'd first. Mr. Atkinson likewise told me Buckley had been talking to me, and had persuaded me to say the cavalry fir'd first; and, because I would not say as they wanted, I was never brought up to give my evidence in the Court; and when I made application to Mr. Allinson, the attorney, for something to carry me home, he said he had orders to give me nothing; and Matthew Bradley, clerk to Mr. Allen, said I should be pillor'd, before the 3 months' end, if I did not mind what I was about. And this is the real truth; I am ready to attest it before any man in England.  
CHARLES HEARNSHAW."

We have no hesitation in making the above declaration public. Of CHARLES HEARNSHAW we know nothing. We never saw the declarant in our life, nor ever held any communication with him till the information, contained in the above paper, was transmitted to us for insertion. All we know of the matter is, that it appears, from the Crown Calendar, that the magistrates, in making out the commitments, acted principally upon his information; and if it were proper that a number of our countrymen should be sent to the county gaol, and put upon their trials for their lives, on the testimony of this witness, there can be no impropriety in giving his own account of the nature of that testimony. If the assertions of this witness for the Crown are to be relied upon, he was first tampered with, then insulted, and lastly, withheld from the witness-box, because he did not choose to fashion his evidence according to the dictation of the prosecutors!

...

LEEDS Saturday, Aug. 2

They write from Huddersfield that the reign of terror is at an end, and that in addition to the prisoners liberated from York, the eighteen men said to have been confined in a temporary prison at that place, either as rioters or witnesses, have all been liberated. On Sunday, the men and boys, amounting to twenty-two in number, who had been acquitted at York, or discharged for want of sufficient evidence to put them on their trial, were met on their approach to Huddersfield by an immense number of men, women, and children, who hailed their safe return. The scenes which were exhibited between the men and their families and the boys and their parents, at this happy meeting, we shall not pretend to describe. Whatever might be the disposition of any of the accused before they went to York, it was evident that they had availed themselves of the advice of the "righteous judge," as they style Baron Wood, for even in this moment of exultation, there was not the least indication of tumult and excess. As to the prisoners, we are bound by the laws of our country to consider them innocent of the crimes laid to their charge, but that there has been very unjustifiable excesses in the neighbourhood must not be denied, and we hope that the persons engaged in them, will, from this moment, discard from their minds any rankling feelings of revenge or resentment for the events of past years, and conduct themselves peaceably and as becomes good subjects in time to come. If severity produced or aggravated animosity and heart-burnings which every good man must deplore, let clemency extinguish these dispositions, and cast the mantle of oblivion over scenes that ought long since to have been forgotten. Not that we would advise any portion of our countrymen to sink into a state of apathy and indifference to their rights and privileges as Englishmen. They are their birth-right, and we hope they will always be ready to assert and maintain them. All we wish is, that they should, in every question connected with public affairs, act publicly, for no truth can be more clear than that where secrecy begins safety ends. We are persuaded that no circumstance could have occurred of a more tranquillizing nature than the acquittals at York. From this time we hope to date a cordial and friendly disposition between the different classes of society in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. The people will, there is little doubt, become obedient to the laws, and we hope the Magistrates will meet this disposition by ruling in wisdom and moderation. The local military force can only act under their authority, and we hope they will make it their concern to repress, rather than to encourage, any disposition in the Yeomanry force to consider their countrymen as their foes. Military men ought not to be ardent politicians, it is their duty rather to watch over the peace of society, than to interfere with the political creed of their neighbours.

In the progress of the trials at York, it became clear that violent outrages had been committed, or rather had been meditated, in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th of June; but it was at the same time perfectly manifest, that this local sedition had been greatly exaggerated, and that all the sinister attempts to give to the riotous proceedings at Folly-Hall Bridge, and the collection of arms in the village of Honley, the character of an insurrection, calculated to endanger the safety of the state, was a gross attempt to practise on the public credulity. The infamous picture of the disturbances drawn by a paper in this place, and copied into the London Treasury Journals, on the eve of the assizes, had, to be sure, the semblance of a likeness, but it was a hideous caricature, and the story about an intended "massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent," proved to be the creature of a distempered imagination, unsupported on the trials by a single tittle of evidence. If the writer of that inflammatory article has not interred all sense of shame in the gulph of his party prejudices, his face must be suffused with blushes, when he compares his paper of the 14th of July, with the report of the trials contained in the same paper of the 28th. Well might Baron Wood, after such a flagrant attempt had been made to mislead the public, caution the jury against suffering their minds to be prejudiced by anything they had heard out of Court. It was agreed on all hands, that the rioters were little more than an unorganized rabble; and it was stated by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was shot, that the insurgent army, assembled at Folly Hall Bridge, amounted only to between 60 and 70 men. Mr. Whitehead, the constable, who looked, it should seem, through a glass of *multiplying* powers, stated the numbers to be upwards of 400.

The Assizes at York will terminate this evening.

We are informed that the Derby calendar contains a great number of criminals, and among them 23 for high treason. The Judge (Mr. J. Holroyd) in his charge to the Grand Jury, commented with great precision and perspicuity upon the Treason Act, 25th of Edward III., the 36th of the King, and the 57th, which made the two former applicable to the Prince Regent. True bills are returned against the other prisoners, of whom six have been convicted. Nothing remarkable has occurred in the case of any of them.

## Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 09 August 1817

*This is an abridged form of the article that appeared in the Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817.*

### TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS.

In reference to the Trials the Yorkshire Rioters, published in our last paper, the Leeds' Mercury contains, among other matter, the following remarks:—

"The trials of the State prisoners, as they have been pompously called, closed at York last Saturday; and the four-and-twenty persons against whom the Government solicitor was instructed to institute prosecutions, ten have been pronounced not guilty; against eleven others no bills were found; and one has been liberated on bail; leaving only two in the whole number in Confinement, and those two unfortunate men have been detained, without trial, by a Secretary of State's warrant, under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Thus ends the Yorkshire plot!

"The failure of these prosecutions has not been owing to any want of zeal, or deficiency of means, on the part of the Government.

"While we speak of the *zeal* manifested by the persons officially engaged in the trials of the prisoners, we cannot but regret that the Judge should have had occasion complain, in the presence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Haigh, the committing magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the magistrates required, till had made particular inquiry for them. The upright mind of Baron Wood, it was evident, felt wounded by this proceeding, and any thing like reluctance to give to the accused all the advantages any discrepancy between the original examination of a witness and his evidence before the Court, will always be viewed with suspicion by a people jealous of their privileges, and anxious in the highest degree to preserve the stream of public justice free from contamination. The apology made for this suspicious omission by Mr. Le Blanc, the solicitor for the Crown, must be felt by every lover of justice to be extremely unsatisfactory. Some of the examinations, he says, were not taken on oath: but that surely is no reason why the others should be withheld!—and why, we should be glad to know, were examinations involving the liberty and lives of many of our countrymen not taken in the usual and authorised way? Mr. Allison, the clerk to the Huddersfield magistrates, and the professional coadjutor of the Crown solicitor in these prosecutions, might have instructed Mr. Allen's inexperience. Though his modesty may not allow it, the people of Huddersfield, and the professional gentlemen of the county of York, well know that there are few gentlemen in their profession better acquainted with the duties of a magistrate's law-clerk, or who has had more experience in criminal matters, than Mr. Allison. If our memory does not fail us, this gentleman acted as law-clerk to Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Radcliffe, during the whole of the disturbances in 1812, when no fewer than 64 persons were committed to York-castle, and when 17 of that number were capitally convicted. Inexperience, therefore, is out of the question; but supposing this to have been the case, the public will naturally inquire, whether Mr. Le Blanc is also inexperienced? and why he who had the chief direction of the prosecution did not order the depositions to be laid before the Judge? These documents were, however tardily, at length produced, and the penetrating eye of Baron Wood soon discovered that Samuel Winpenny had sworn one thing before the magistrates, and another before the Court; and this contradiction on a point of essential importance was very properly deemed by his Lordship fatal to the Witness's testimony.

"We have been led into these observations by a circumstance of a very extraordinary nature that has come to our knowledge, and which bears a striking affinity the case of McKinle, so recently before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh: but before we proceed to state the facts to which we allude, it may be proper, for the perfect understanding of the subject, to quote the words of Baron Wood, in his charge to the Jury, on the trial of Benjamin Lockwood and others, for maliciously, shooting at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield yeomanry cavalry, on the night the 8th of June. After adverting to the testimony George Armytage, one of the witnesses for the Crown, who had sworn that he and a person of the name of Earnshaw, or Hearnshaw, had been forced to join the rioters at Folly-hall-bridge, his Lordship said—— "There is another circumstance deserving the serious consideration of the jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness. He has been in the custody of the prosecutors; he is now at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present, and to have seen all the circumstances that Armytage has asserted in evidence; and yet he is not produced! The Jury will draw their own inferences from this strong fact. It was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness."

"Upon this text of Mr. Baron Wood, the following declaration of Charles Hearnshaw, the witness referred to, furnishes the alarming comment: we publish the document, *verbatim*, as it has been sent to us, [with the exception of one word used sportively by the Grand Jury], chusing rather to retain even the grammatical inaccuracies, than to make any alterations in the paper itself:—

"DECLARATION CHARLES HEARNSHAW.

"Transmitted for publication form Huddersfield, o  
"Thursday, the 31st of July, 1817.

"I was examined, the 21st of June, by Mr. B. Allen, Magistrate, concerning the Folly-hall fight:— He asked if I could tell him who fir'd first? I told him the cavalry fir'd first, at the Folly Hall Bridge, on the 8th of June. Mr. Allen told me I was mistaken, it was a gun in Manchester-street that I heard. I told him it was not a gun Manchester-street, it was the gentlemen cavalry: I was certain of it: but they would not put that in my examination. When I was going to be examined by the grand jury, at York, Mr. Thomas Atkinson came to me, and asked me, if would do him a favour? I asked him what it was? He said, he could wish me to say the mob fir'd first and bought a shilling's worth of oranges; and he told me if did not say the mob fired first, I should have four or five evidences against me, namely, Mr. T. Atkinson, Mr. David Alexander, Mr. Allen the magistrate, and George Whitehead the constable. I told the grand jury the truth; I told them the cavalry fired first, and I told them the ball wiz'd close by my head.—They asked me if I was not afraid: I told them I was not. I told them, then, there was about eight or nine of the mob fired, and immediately the cavalry galloped off. The Grand Jury said, they was——, and laugh'd. Saturday, the 26th, a gentleman from London sent for me, Mr. Liblong, Solicitor for the Crown, I think they call'd him, and he asked me what I meant to say when I got into the Court? I told him I meant to speak the truth; I told him I meant to say that the cavalry fir'd first. He told me I was a damned lieing rascal, and said I had had conversation with Buckley, and he had persuaded me to say so. He asked me if I could not as well say the mob fir'd first, say the cavalry fir'd first. Mr. Atkinson likewise told me Buckley had been talking to me, and had persuaded me to say the cavalry fir'd first; and, because I would not say as they wanted, I was never brought up to give my evidence in the Court; and when I made application to Mr. Allinson, the attorney, for something to carry me home, he said he had orders to give me nothing; and Matthew Bradley, clerk to Mr. Allen, said I should be pillor'd, before the 3 months' end, if I did not mind what I was about. And this is the real truth; I am ready to attest it before any man in England. CHARLES HEARNSHAW."

This same writer also says, that if nothing came out about Oliver on the trials, it was not for want proof that he had meddled: "had it been necessary to prove that this spy had been in communication with the leaders of the sedition, and that he had 'aided, counselled, and comforted' them, that evidence was at hand." This, however, rests on the Editor of the Mercury's *ipse dixit*: we copy the following extracts from another Leeds paper which will soon show how much his statement is to be depended upon.

"*To the Editor of the, Leeds Intelligencer.*

Sir, —From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the *Leeds Mercury*, of Saturday, August 2nd, I think myself called upon to DENY, MOST POSITIVELY, that any Conversation passed, in my Presence, of the Nature alluded to in the Declaration signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW." Your Insertion of this, in your *Intelligencer*, will much oblige. Sir, Your obedient Servant, B. HAIGH ALLEN.  
"Greenhead, 2nd August, 1817."

"We were so much occupied with the details of the late important trials of the Huddersfield rioters, that we had not room, in our last, for remarks. They furnish, however, independently of the villainous attempts which have in consequence been made to attach the vilest imputation's upon the Magistracy and others who were active in bringing the insurgents to trial, abundant matter for serious reflection, and for the exercise of the strictest vigilance, in guarding against the future designs of the disaffected in that and other quarters. What we are about to state is of the deepest importance; and though it is difficult to restrain the boiling indignation occasioned by the ceaseless perversions of an unprincipled and seditious press, we shall endeavour to treat the subject with that temper and moderation which its solemn importance demands. From motives of the purest delicacy, and of respect for the upright and learned Judge who presided at these trials, we intended to have carefully abstained from all notice of fatal misunderstanding, under which he laboured respecting the *examinations* of some of the witnesses, taken in the earlier stages of the proceedings, by the Committing Magistrates. And the *friends* of the prisoners, we should have imagined, resting satisfied with the verdict of their acquittal, would have been more anxious to enjoy that *triumph* in silent satisfaction, than to recur for the insolent purpose of insulting the Magistracy and the Government, to that slippery ground from which the prisoners made, in the words of the Judge, so "*narrow an escape*" with whole necks. As they have, however, affected, in the midst of their real joy, "regret that the Judge had occasion to complain, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the Magistrates required, till he had made particular inquiry for them,"—we feel ourselves bound to complete the history of that unfortunate misunderstanding, *part of which*, and the most important part, has been *wilfully suppressed*, by the individuals who have been so imprudent as to bring all before the public. The Judge then, not only *complained*, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates; he distinctly imputed to them, not only in their own presence, but in that of the Jury, and in open Court, IMPROPER MOTIVES, and an ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE THE JUDGE! We know not what were the feelings of the active and honourable Magistrates at that moment. Those of our Reporter trembled for them, and for the character of the Magisterial jurisprudence of the country. But his fears were instantly dissipated by the open and prompt conduct of the Magistrates. The parties who have brought this circumstance before the public well know (for they were present in Court during the time) that the Committing Magistrates immediately offered to give explanations ON OATH, which would have satisfactorily accounted not only for any apparent irregularity in the production of the examinations, but would have also accounted for the seeming "discrepancy" between the examinations and the evidence. One of the Magistrates Mr. Allen, was actually sworn, and was about to reply to some interrogatories of the Counsel,—when— *The Judge PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO HEAR HIM!* In laying this important fact before the public we repeat that we have not the intention of imputing the slightest blame to the learned Judge, who, we firmly believe, being under a misunderstanding, did that, and that only, which his conscience, and a high sense of his duty, dictated. Though it is our opinion, therefore, that his refusal to hear the Magistrates had a fatal effect upon the prosecution, we submitted in respectful silence to the verdict, rather than the conscientious conduct of a Judge and Jury should be called in question. With an indecent and imprudent eagerness, however, the occurrence has been dragged, in partial and distorted shape, before the public, by those who ought to been for ever silent on the circumstances of the late trials, from which their friends made so narrow an escape; and we can have no hesitation in saying that *their* motives, in concealing the fact that the offer of the Magistrates to explain was rejected, are base and designing and wicked, as has been their whole conduct, first in inciting the deluded classes of the people to outrage, and afterwards in labouring incessantly to forward their projects by active assistance; by denying the existence of those projects while denial was possible and by palliating them when they could no longer be concealed.

"Thus far from our own knowledge. We have authority, upon which we can rely, for stating further that the Judge (too late, unfortunately, for public justice) was, after the trial, satisfied that he had been mistaken and SENT AN APOLOGY TO MR. ALLEN, *one of the Committing Magistrates*, for the expressions he had used. The mistake was perhaps natural, and was at all events on the side of mercy, as was another error into which he fell with respect to the testimony, on a material point, of the witness Winpenny. In spite of the assurances of the Counsel for the prosecution, his Lordship persisted in this mistake, till Mr. Gurney handed him an extract of the evidence, *verbatim*, from his notes.

"The infamous trumped up paper, published in the last Mercury, and entitled the "*Declaration of Charles Hearnshaw*" in which Mr. Allen, Mr. Thomas Atkinson, and Mr. Le Blanc, are most foully and libellously charged with having endeavoured to bribe or threaten Hearnshaw to give false evidence, and with having actually falsified his deposition, we pronounce at once to be entirely destitute of truth. So far as Mr. Allen is concerned, we already present the Public (see his letter above) with that Gentleman's unqualified contradiction. And, if the other parties libelled do not in the mean time determine on vindicating their names in another place, we shall be prepared with the proofs of their honour also in our next. We happened to learn, on the very day of the trial, the real reason that Hearnshaw was not called to give his evidence. It was ascertained that he had been closetted, for a considerable time, with one of the gentlemen employed for the prisoners; and his *Declaration* proves not only how aptly he had imbibed his lesson, but how accurately the Counsel for the Crown had calculated the effect of the conference, when they declined to place him in the witness box.—This fellow's Declaration, y-the-bye, except that he *now* maintains the cavalry fired first, and not the insurgents, goes only to prove the main facts of the outrage, and that he himself was present, thus *confirming*, the Reader will not fail to observe, *the evidence of George Armitage*. That the insurgents fired first, is indisputably established, by the unquestionable and positive testimony of Capt. Armytage and Mr. Alexander, as well as by that of Mr. Whitehead the Constable, and of George Armitage. IF the Leeds Mercury, therefore, in his eagerness to fabricate falsehood, and to give currency to every falsehood which is generated in the lowest dregs of his party, had not been blinded to all perception of truth, as well as dead to all sense of shame, he might have discovered, at a glance, before he so grossly committed himself, and so flagrantly abused the liberty of the press, by publishing so atrocious a libel, that Hearnshaw's story contains internal evidence of utter falsehood,— the principal drift of it being, (next to that of libelling the parties named in it,) to make it appear that the first shot was fired by the *cavalry*, though the contrary has been irrefragably established.

"Just as our Paper was going to Press, we received the following Communication from Mr. Atkinson, of Colne Bridge, addressed

"*To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury.*  
Sir—I have seen a Declaration, in your Paper of this Day, signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW," which I should deem unworthy of Notice, but from your insinuation that I had tampered with him.—I feel it a Duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make Oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate; and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least Insinuation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any "Favour" of, or "tampered" with him in any way. I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my Examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry had fired first, and I then observed, that he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he. The paltry circumstance about the *Orange Bribe* arose from the Complaints of George Armitage and himself being detained long without Dinner, whilst waiting upon the Grand Jury; a Gentleman, hearing them complain, gave them a Biscuit, and I gave them a Shilling for Oranges. These *Bribes* were given in the most public Manner, as many Persons then present can testify. The Public will judge the Falsehood of Hearnshaw's Declaration, from his Statement that I said I should contradict him, when it was a well-known Fact that I was Three Miles from the Bridge at the Time of the Firing. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,  
"THOMAS ATKINSON,  
Colne Bridge, August 2nd, 1817."

We should not enter into this discussion did we not observe that there are Editors in this part of the country who copy all charges similar to those contained in the Leeds Mercury, without laying before their readers a single line in the way of explanation, tho' well aware of the existence of such matter. And yet these are the exclusive truth-tellers!

### THE PROSECUTION OF THE HUDDERSFIELD RIOTERS AND THEIR WITNESSES

IN another part of our publication of this day, will be found a letter from MR. R. HAIGH ALLEN, Esq. one of the Huddersfield Magistrates, denying, in positive terms, that any conversation of the nature referred to in CHARLES HEARNSHAW's Declaration, inserted in our last week's paper, took place in his presence. This disclaimer of Mr. ALLEN is followed by a letter from Mr. THOMAS ATKINSON, in which he asserts that he asked no *favour* of CHARLES HEARNSHAW as stated in his Declaration, but admits that he had a conversation with him in the anti-room, previous to the examination of Hearnshaw before the Grand Jury, and that he combated the evidence which Hearnshaw stated that it was his intention to give, respecting the first fire at Folly-hall-Bridge, on the night of the 8th of June, and endeavoured to influence his mind contrary to the witness's avowed impressions of the facts to which he was about to swear. Mr. Atkinson adds, that he did indeed give Armitage and Hearnshaw a shilling's worth of oranges, because they had been so long detained from their dinner,—but that this "bribe," as Mr. Atkinson calls it, was given in the most public manner.

Upon the appearance of these counter-statements, we felt it to be our duty to write to a tradesman in Huddersfield, requesting that he would see Hearnshaw, the declarant, and inquire into the truth of his Declaration; adding, that if he had, either from design or inadvertency, stated any thing that was false, to the disadvantage of Mr. Allen or Mr. Atkinson, or any of the other persons mentioned in his publication, it was as much his duty to make a public retraction of those statements, (if erroneous) as it was to persist in them if true. In reply to this letter, Hearnshaw himself came over to Leeds, and waited upon the Printer of this Paper, when he re-asserted, in the presence of a gentleman of the town, all the facts he had stated in his Declaration, and added, that he was ready to verify them, upon oath, before any Magistrate in the kingdom.

It is no part of our duty to reconcile the conflicting testimony of Mr. Allen and Mr. Thomas Atkinson with that of Charles Hearnshaw. They are, indeed, irreconcileable. It is assertion against assertion. We have merely inserted the papers as they have reached us, without feeling either responsibility or anxiety about the truth of any of them. The conflict, it will be observed, is between the parties in the prosecution and one of their principal witnesses, and it is impossible to imagine any thing that could be more gratifying to the feelings of the State prisoners, so lately acquitted or discharged, for want of evidence to put them upon their trial, than to find the committing Magistrate and one of the witnesses, on whose testimony they were committed to York Castle, impeaching each other's veracity. The prosecutors, in these State trials, are, to be sure, placed in a most curious predicament, with respect to their witnesses —those they did produce the Court would not believe, and those they did not produce they will not believe themselves !

There is, however, one part of Hearnshaw's evidence, and that the most material part of it, which stands uncontradicted, and which, we understand, is unquestionable, namely, that he was examined before the Grand Jury, and that, because his testimony did not square with the wishes of the prosecutors for conviction, he was not produced on the trial, though as the learned Judge observed, "it was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness." BARON WOOD added, that the Jury would draw their own inferences from this strong fact.

The characteristic feature of these prosecutions was *suppression*. In the first place, the depositions of the witnesses, taken by the committing magistrates, were withheld, contrary to the usual practice, till the Judge made particular inquiries for them:— in the second, the evidence of a principal witness was suppressed, though he had been kept a month in confinement in order to be prepared to give that evidence:— and, in the third and last place, if we are rightly informed. the depositions taken before the Magistrates at Wakefield, during their inquiry into this business, on the 9th of June, though containing, we have reason to believe, important matter to the prisoners, was also suppressed. In the emphatic words of BARON WOOD, the public "will draw their own inferences" from these "strong facts."

POSTSCRIPT

...

It is a fact deserving of observation, that in both the reports of the trial of the persons charged with stealing arms and with tumultuous proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, inserted in the Intelligencer, the editor of that paper *suppressed* the Judge's charges *in toto*. But in order to compensate his readers for the omission, he has presented them this week with a *proscription* list, and has actually had the extreme folly to hold up certain Gentlemen by name as the intended objects of assassination. For ourselves we believe this list to be the fabrication of some Government informer, with whom probably this Government scribe is in communication. As nothing came out upon the trial respecting the announced "massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage to fearful extent," we are told that this exposure is reserved till a future period, and that *when* the trials of the persons sent to York Castle and detained on a charge of high treason come on, *then* the whole of these horrors will appear. This is probably true; *when* those trials do come on, strange sights will be seen. If we recollect right, the public were assured, on precisely the same authority as that on which the proscription list rests, that at the assizes which have just passed, a number of the prisoners were to be tried for *high treason*, but this proved to be "an unaccountable mistake!" This renowned proscription will, we have no doubt, prove to be "an unaccountable mistake" also, and we hope the proscribed and her families will have too much good sense to make themselves uneasy about the danger of the assassin, which we believe, like Macbeth's dagger, is purely *aerial*— "a dagger of the mind."

In reading the *Intelligencer* of the present week, one is puzzled to discover whether Baron Wood or the Printer of the Leeds Mercury is most to *blame* for the acquittal of the State prisoners at York, and for the *fatal* consequences of that acquittal, though we think, on the whole, the Judge has it. If, however, the very *impartial* Editor has been a little too severe upon the judge and upon the Printer, he has been sufficiently indulgent towards the prosecutors, for he has very obligingly forborne from saying a single word in condemnation of those omissions and commissions at which the humane feelings of the whole Court were revolted. Upon the prisoners he bears unmercifully, directing his condemnation indiscriminately against those who were acquitted, and those who, after having been immured in prison for several weeks, were sent home, because there was not sufficient evidence even to put them upon their trials. They, poor souls, have nothing to give, but the Magistrates and the yeomanry, who have favours to bestow, he lauds to the skies. The maxim of this *Sir Pertimax Mac Sycophant* is to bless every man possess'd of aught to give.

"And oh! in Downing Street should old Nick revel  
"England's prime minister, he'd bless the Devil."

[TH: TO DO - what was the declaration in "last week's paper"?]

[TH: what was in the Intelligencer???]

To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury

Sir,— From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the *Leeds Mercury*, of Saturday, August 2d, I think myself called upon, *to deny, most positively*, that any conversation passed, in my presence, of the nature alluded to in the declaration signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW". Your insertion of this, in your paper, will much oblige, Sir,

Your obedient servant,  
B. HAIGH ALLEN  
Greenhead, 2d Aug. 1817

To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury

Sir,— I have seen a Declaration, in your Paper of this Day, signed "CHARLES HEARNSHAW," which I should deem unworthy of my notice, but for your insinuation that I had tampered with him. I feel it is a duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate;  and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least intimation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any "favour" of or "tampered" with him in any way. I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting-Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry fired first, and I then observed he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he.

The paltry circumstance about the *Orange-Bribe*, arose from the complaints of George Armitage and himself being detained so long without dinner, whilst waiting upon the Grand Jury; a gentleman, on hearing them complain, gave them a biscuit, and I gave them a shilling for oranges. These *Bribes* were given in the most public manner, as many persons then present can testify.

The Public will judge of the falsehood of Hearnshaw's Declaration, from his statement that I said, I should contradict him. when it was a well known fact that I was three miles from the Bridge at the time of the firing.

I am, Sir,  
Your obedient Servant,  
THOMAS AKINSON  
Colne-Bridge, Aug. 2d, 1817.

## Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 11 August 1817

We had intended, by a future examination of the falsehoods respecting Oliver, to have shewn still more clearly the abominable and fraudulent artifices resorted to, in order to impose on the public, respecting the proceedings of that individual; but, on more mature consideration, we think his innocence has already been so irrefutably established, that all further discussion on the subject can only serve to give importance to the often-told tales of his enemies.—We shall only, therefore, give a word or two of advice to his accusers, which will put their sincerity to the test, and even this, after all that has passed, would be unnecessary, were it not that there are so many persons who are determined to adhere to falsehood in the face of conviction,

If they are so satisfied, as they pretend to be, of Oliver's guilt, why do they not have him apprehended? The man, we believe, is in London; and, no doubt, if a moderate reward be offered for taking him, they may have him lodged in safe custody within a few days after they shall have taken the proper steps for laying hold of him. Surely the Faction are not reduced so wretchedly low, that they cannot raise a sufficient sum, by subscription, to carry on a prosecution against a single individual, whom they can clearly convict, they say, of the most enormous guilt— of having laboured, as much as he could, to overthrow the security and happiness of the country, and the safety of individuals.

*Is their patriotism come to this?* They talk loudly of the sacrifices they would make for Country (though, by the way, it has so happened that they have never yet discerned a single opportunity for making any sacrifice); and yet, if we believe their own assertions, the liberty, security, and peace, of the country, are to be overthrown with impunity by Mr. Oliver, rather than a few of them will subscribe a guinea a piece to bring him to punishment! They clamour, it is true, for Government to institute proceedings against him; but, the cunning rogues know that Government are satisfied of his innocence; and that, with all their condescension, that are not quite so complaisant as to subject an innocent man to the trouble, anxiety, and inconvenience of a trial, merely for the purpose of *pleasing them!* Let them either, therefore, drop the name of Oliver for ever, or let them subject him at once, and in a manly manner, to the operation of the law.—Let them lay information against him on oath—find persons to prosecute—and the necessary funds for carrying the prosecution on; and let them offer so small a reward its TEN GUINEAS for his apprehension; and we will stake our character for foresight on the issue, if Mr. Oliver is not taken by the neck within ten days after the reward is publicly advertised. We offer them the use of the Intelligencer for the Advertisement, if they think proper to adopt the plan recommended.

By the way, we can state, from authority, that the two Magistrates who once doubted Oliver's innocence, and who examined him, in consequence, at the Secretary of State's Office, investigated the charges against him, with the most scrupulous care, not less than two hours, before they declared themselves completely satisfied of the utter falsehood of all the fabrications against him. As the name of one of these Magistrates (perhaps without his concurrence) was employed to give some colour to the falsehoods, we have rather anxiously indulged a hope that he would come forward, and officially acknowledge he had been satisfied of Oliver's innocence. We think this is an act of Justice (though we presume not to assert it is imperative on the party in question) due to Mr. Oliver, and not only to him, but to the public at large. There is one falsehood connected with the use made of this Magistrate's name, which we ourselves are enabled to contradict. The party by whom the whole tale was tromped up, had the temerity not merely to insinuate, but directly to assert, that the Magistrate in question, at the first impulse of disgust, had some intention of throwing up his commission.— Though the "Getter-up-of-the-Plot," however, had so far imposed upon him as to succeed in making him doubt the innocence of Oliver, the idea of throwing up his commission never entered his mind, and is altogether the creation of those who fabricated so many other little circumstances, for the purpose of exciting a *great sensation* in Parliament and in the country.

But, if there are reasons sufficiently strong to induce to waive further discussion respecting Oliver, after the Public have been satisfied of his innocence, there are more weighty and powerful reasons against prolonging a controversy which involves, in some degree, the almost sacred character of a British Judge, and the purity and honour of a British Magistrate. The Magistrate has already unequivocally refuted the abominable calumny directed against him by the villainous master and tool of the vilest dregs of disaffection is this district; and, for a moment to balance "his assertion" against the "assertion of Charles Hearnshaw," and of Edward Baines, even though there were not so many other conclusive proofs that the charge was utterly false, would be offering an insult to the public sense and to public decency, and a greater outrage on the honour and feeling of Mr. Allen, as a man, a magistrate, and a gentleman, than any to which the upright discharge of his public duties has yet subjected him. The futile attempt to fix a stigma upon his name, by those whose avocation is to traduce everything truly good, and great, and virtuous, is a proof of the meritorious zeal with which he has exerted himself in the public service, and can only serve to place those exertions in the most conspicuous light; while the abhorrent indignation of every good man is directed against his traducers.

Another of the gentlemen libelled, Mr. Thomas Atkin.on, also vindicated his name, in our last, from the foul aspersion cast upon it; though his letter was received so late, that we could not allude to it at the same time with Mr. Allen's; and it may therefore have escaped the notice of some of our Readers. The third party libelled, Mr. Le Blanc, we find had left Yorkshire before the slander was published; and has either not yet had time to repel it, or (though the Libeller, struck with terror at the probable consequences of his temerity, now affects to say he published the calumny, "without feeling either anxiety or responsibility about its truth,") Mr. Le Blanc may very properly have determined on calling the aggressor to account before a more solemn tribunal than that which he is afforded by the column of a newspaper.

As for the conduct of the Judge, and the history of the examination, we do most solemnly assure the Public, that what we stated in our last (to which we beg leave to refer) was the truth, and nothing but the truth. As that statement, also contained the WHOLE TRUTH, we have no new facts to communicate on the subject; and, though it would be an easy matter to dissipate the sophistry, and to clear up the misstatements, of those who have had the audacity to pervert the facts for the vilest purposes, we entered, last week, with too much reluctance and caution upon so delicate a discussion, not to feel inclined to abstain from all unnecessary prolongation of it. It is not so with the factious agitators of this unpleasant affair. It is their object and business, to lessen, by all possible means, whether fair or foul, that just respect which is due to persons in authority. Whether they succeed or fail, therefore, in establishing a calumny, their end is partly accomplished, if they can only manage to keep the imputation for any of length of time before the public, and familiarise the minds of the lowest of the people to imputations that make them think and speak of their superiors with suspicion and disrespect. In the present instances, it would be all one to them whether the character of the Judge, or of the Magistrate, or of both, suffered by the controversy, so as *mischief* is any how produced. They perceive we are aware of their system; and that we are not, of course, to be betrayed by the warmth of our feelings (indignant as they are) into the furtherance of their insidious designs.
  
We are not amongst those who are inclined to attach unworthy motives to any man in the discharge of his duties; but there is a circumstance connected with this affair which is rather curious, and which clearly proves that all the perverse statements of the incendiary demagogues who labour incessantly to agitate the public mind, ought to he viewed with the greatest distrust.
  
The Mercury states, that "Mr. Allison, solicitor, of Huddersfield, (who acted as Clerk to the Magistrates  when the prisoners were committed,) said to the Judge" on the day after the misunderstanding, "My Lord, no fault whatever is imputable to Mr. Allen on account of the depositions not having been regularly laid before your Lordship; if there be any fault, it is solely attributable to myself; and my Lord, as I have not been in the habit of acting as a Magistrates' Clerk, I trust your Lordship will impute any irregularity that may have occurred, to my ignorance of what ought to have been done in this respect."
  
In this report of what was said by Mr. Allison, there is, as usual, a mixture of truth and falsehood. That gentleman did not admit that the depositions had not been laid regularly before the Judge.— He merely said, that *if* any thing was wrong, or *if* there had been any mistake, he alone, on account of his inexperience, had been to blame; and he concluded with a just tribute of respect to Mr. Allen, than whom, he said, there was not a more active or upright Magistrate in the county.
  
But, this perversion is, comparatively, of little moment. On the Mercury's own showing, Mr. Allison admitted himself to be *wholely and solely blameable for any irregularity which might have occurred*.
  
Yet, (and let the Reader mark this carefully) the Mercury *wholly and solely* attributes the blame, coupled with an imputation of the *vilest intentions*, not to Mr. Allison, but, *to the Magistrates!*—and, being secretly grateful to Mr. Allison, for any (supposed) mistake, which tended materially to defeat the ends of public justice, the Mercury, instead of *blaming* him, to whom alone, if there was any blame at all, that blame is due, warmly eulogises Mr. Allison for his professional abilities, compliments him on his modesty, and particularly praises him for his skill and experience as a Magistrate's Clerk!!!
  
Not one word more, we are satisfied, is necessary to make the blood of every honest man boil with indignation at the systematic and villainous attempts which are made to excite hatred of the Magistracy and of the laws, amongst the people.
  
Further, however, it is well known that Mr. Allison is of *Whig principles!* The Committing Magistrates, happily, are not of his party! The foul mind of the Mercury, if a similar event had occurred under other circumstances—if a *Tory* Magistrates' Clerk had committed a mistake as favourable to *Tory* prisoners before a *Whig* tribunal—in such a case, we say, the Mercury would not have hesitated to assert, or at least to insinuate, that the mistake had been purposely *committed, in order prejudice the Judge and Jury against the prosecution, and against the conduct and motives of the Prosecutors!*
  
Though this certainly was *the fatal effect of the misunderstanding in question*, we would spurn, with as much indignation as Mr. Allison himself, at so base and unworthy a suspicion. He discharged his duty, *we are not the slightest doubt*, to the best of his ability, and with perfect integrity;—and we have put the preceding case, merely for the purpose of exposing to him, and *to all other respectable men of his party*, the extreme danger of giving credit to, or at all countenancing, the slanderous imputations of any low, despicable, and seditious demagogue, conscientiously discharging public official duties.— Let them not be flattered into becoming the instruments of such men,— lest they be *judged by their own judgement*.
  
> In reading of the Trials at the late Assizes in various parts of the kingdom, we have been very much disgusted to observe the flippancy which several of the Gentlemen of the Bar appear to have conducted themselves.—"There be of them that will themselves launch, to set on some quantity of barren? spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the *suit* be then to be considered; that's villainous; and shows a most pitiful ambition in him who uses it." It is a practice that ought to be generally discountenanced; for can any thing be more intolerable than that when the character and property of any man, however humble, are at stake in a Court of Justice, his counsel, instead of evincing the anxiety which would become him on such an occasion, is to be occupied in racking his memory for a stale joke, or availing himself of any passing occurrence to vent some miserable pun;  in order, as he perhaps conceives, to show his country auditor what a smart man a London barrister is. This is one of those offences against good sense and decency, which we think it behoves every public writer to visit with marked reprobation; and in saying his we are sure that credit will be given to us for entertaining towards the legal profession all the respect to which it is justly entitled when the duties of that profession are discharged,—as, happily, in most instances, the are discharged,—with fidelity and dignity.—*Courier*
  
The preceding judicious observations of the *Courier*, apply so well to the treatment of Mr. David Alexander, that we adopt them at once in alluding to the very unhandsome manner in which one of the Counsel for the prisoners attempted to show off his wit, at Mr. A.'s expense, during the trial of Lockwood, Woffendan, &c. at our late assizes.
  
Besides resorting to every artifice of the law, in favour of their clients (with which we do not mean to find any fault), and exerting themselves in every possible manner to prejudice the minds of the Jury against the prosecution, and in favour of the prisoners, one of the Counsel thought fit to single out Mr. Alexander as a mark for his wit, levelling at him the coarsest and most indecorous sarcasms, while he was giving his evidence, though he had the mortification of failing to excite a single risible expression on the countenances of the persons present.
  
Mr. Alexander had been, on two occasions, in the discharge of his duty, not as an ordinary soldier, but as an armed citizen, exposing himself for the protection of his neighbours, and the preservation of the public peace, *fired at in one night*. Some cowardly ruffian shot at him, under cover of the night, while he was on foot, going for his horse; and he was afterwards exposed, in front, to the fire of the insurgents at Folly-hall-bridge, where his horse was severely wounded under him. He had displayed a spirit and intrepidity which entitle him to respect, and which must receive the approbation and thanks of every man who is disposed to appreciate those qualities when exhibited in a good cause; and, the only return which was made him for having twice exposed his life to imminent hazard, for the protection of those who were quietly and comfortably asleep in their beds, was to be held up as an object of ridicule to the Court of Justice in which he was called upon to perform another service to the public, by giving his evidence on a case of flagrant public outrage;— to be jeered at about the "sanguinary battle of Folly-hall-bridge in which he had been *engaged*"— *rigged* as the term is, about his "military tactics"—and ironically asked if he had obtained his martial skill and courage at *Waterloo!*

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 09 March 1818

In the House of Commons, on Thursday, there was another long debate, in which Lords Lascelles and Milton took part, respecting the proceedings of Ministers under the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, the employment and character of Oliver, and the allegations of the different persons who have been recently discharged from imprisonment.

Want of room to give even an intelligible abstract of the discussion, compels us merely to state, that the numerous fabrications and falsehoods of the party were again triumphantly refuted—that all the facts and reasoning on those subjects, which have appeared in this paper, during the past twelve months, were fully confirmed,—and that the characters and assertions of the *innocent gentlemen* who have been recently let loose again upon the Public, from Mitchell down to his friend Ben Scholes, of Wakefield, were placed in their proper colours before the House.

THOMAS RILEY.—From a feeling of repugnance to dragging the character of this wretched man, after his suicide, before the Public, we abstained from alluding to his case, till it had been so strangely brought under the notice of Parliament by Lord Milton. And as there have been some gross misrepresentations, it becomes a duty to put the Public in possession of accurate information respecting them.

If Mr. Michael Stocks had taken the trouble to apply to his own respectable relative, who resides near to the house which was occupied by Riley, he could not, with *truth*, have asserted to Lord Milton that he believed Riley was a respectable and loyal subject. On the contrary, he would have been convinced, like all to whom Riley was known, that he was one of the greatest firebrands in the whole neighbourhood.

Some time previous to the atrocious outrages of the Luddites, he had been admitted a Member of the High-street Chapel (in the Methodist Connection) Huddersfield. During his connection with this body, he became Treasurer and Secretary to the *Luddites*, in that district, and in other respects so notorious a character, that the Members of the Chapel waited on their Minister, and wished him to expel Riley from their Society. This the Minister declined to do, until some more formal accusation were brought against him, and supported by such proofs as would justify the measure.

Riley, hearing of this circumstance, went himself to thank the Minister for his favourable treatment; and, in the course of the conversation, admitted that he *did* fill the offices of Treasurer and Secretary to the Luddites, and that he was a *leader*,—attempting, however, at the same time, to justify his conduct, by stating that he did not coincide with those misguided men in principles, but that he was taking care of himself, by appropriating as much of their funds as he could to his own purposes!

Upon this avowal of consummate villany, the Minister no longer hesitated, and ordered him instantly to quit his house. Riley never afterwards attended the Chapel, as a Member.

These facts having been well known, and the man distinguishing himself, on all occasions, by the most malignant Jacobinism, he was, about the time the recent disturbances broke out, strongly suspected. After the affair at Folly-hall Bridge, near Huddersfield, he was apprehended in consequence of information upon oath; and being taken before the magistrates, he confessed where he himself had deposited a quantity of lead and a bullet mould. These were found, by persons sent for the purpose, in the spot Riley described, near a well, in a plantation belonging to Sir John Lister Kaye. He further stated, that he had the mould, &c. about his person, on the morning of the Sunday on which the rising took place—that he was in Huddersfield, waiting for the Manchester coach, by which he expected a Delegate, who was to come from that town to meet him—that while he was waiting for the coach, he saw Whitehead the constable, and was greatly alarmed, lest he should be then taken, and searched.—He further confessed, that they had made it up to murder Whitehead the constable, as well as several gentlemen, against none of whom, he allowed, he entertained any personal animosity.

Whitehead had observed his great agitation, when he saw him waiting for the coach, and watched him, till he saw him go into the Methodist chapel.

While in custody, he declared that if he were hung, he should be right served, as his conduct well deserved it.

Under these feelings of conscious guilt, and the horrible anticipation of a public execution, the wretched man, before he was taken from Huddersfield, suspended himself from his bedstead, and was nearly dead when found in that situation.

A medical gentleman, of Huddersfield, of the first respectability, attended the examination of Riley before the Magistrates, and pronounced him to be of perfectly sound mind.

But the torments of his guilty conscience could not be endured; and, in York Castle, with a razor purloined from a fellow prisoner, he accomplished the dreadful act of self-destruction, which he had failed to effect at Huddersfield.

We are in possession of many facts respecting his past life, but we wish not to rake up more than are sufficient to shew the kind of grounds on which Mr. Michael Stocks can prevail on Lord Milton to obtrude  upon Parliament causeless complaints of the conduct of Ministers.

The fellow-prisoner of Riley, Richard Lee, has lived to send up a string of misrepresentations as to his own treatment. The following documents, being his position, the deposition of Richard Carlson, observations, &c. unveil another of the vile outrages offered to the dignity and good sense of the Legislature.

HOUSE OF COMMONS

[Appendix.] No.48

*Mercurii 25 die Februarii, 1818.*

A petition of Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, in the parish of Kirkburton, and County of York, was presented and read; setting forth, that the Petitioner is by trade a clothier, and hath never committed any crimes against the laws and country, being in every case a true subject of His Majesty King George; that on 13th June 1817, a number of men entered his house, with one *Matthew Bradley* at their head, while the Petitioner was at his work; and the said *M. Bradley* said, in a very insulting manner to the Petitioner, "You must go along with us;" the Petitioner replied, "Very well, but you will let me wash and clean myself first;" when the Petitioner had so done, the said *Matthew Bradley* drew a pistol out of his pocket, and said he would blow the Petitioner's brains out; they then took the Petitioner to an inn near his own house, where he begged to speak to his wife respecting his affairs; but, when she came for that purpose, the said *Bradley* said, the Petitioner must go immediately to Huddersfield, as they were ready and would not wait, and that she, meaning the Petitioner's wife, might follow the Petitioner to Huddersfield if they had any thing to say together; to which town they dragged the Petitioner, guarded by a number of ?? soldiers, and lodged him in a stinking dungeon without a bed or fire, although the Petitioner was wet through; that when the Petitioner's wife came afterwards to see the petitioner next day to Huddersfield, at great charge and hazard, in her situation, being then unwell with a complaint in her breast, which was afterwards cut for a cancer; she was not allowed to see the Petitioner at all; that on the next morning, in this uncomfortable state of mind and body, ill at ease on account of his family, he was brought some refreshment, but he could not eat, and about noon he was taken before a Magistrate, *Mr. B. H. Allen*, who said that the Petitioner was charged with High Treason, and must be hanged; whereupon the Petitioner said, "You make my case very black, it is time to be prepared I think;" he replied, "Yes it is:" about the hour of seven o'clock in the evening, the Petitioner said, "Is't not dinner time?" to this *Mr Thomas Atkinson*, who was present, said, "You shall have your dinner in my room, and sleep in it also:" the Petitioner replied that would be very acceptable, as he had no sleep the last night, but the said *Atkinson* then said, "You must make a man of yourself, and tell me all you know;" to which the Petitioner replied, as the truth was, "I know nothing;" that the said B. H. Allen then called the said Atkinson aside, and said, as the Petitioner could hear, "We must tow?er Lee again;" so, about eight o'clock, the Petitioner was remanded to the dungeon again, and about ten o'clock they came and began searching him while he was fast asleep, owing to his fatigue and want of rest: but being awoke by the search, the Petitioner asked, "What are you about?" but no answer was given to him, and they returned to him a three-shilling piece they had taken from his pocket just as he awoke, and kept him in this offensive dungeon five successive nights, and would not permit his wife to speak to him during that time, nor was he allowed to see her for three weeks afterwards: that the Petitioner was afterwards put into an empty room, where he remained six days without any bed or bedding, save only a handful of straw to lie upon, but no covering of any sort whatsoever but his own clothes that he had on: that on the 16th of July he was removed to York Castle like a felon, and ironed, in which state he was kept during the whole of his confinement, being twenty weeks and two days, five days of which time he was obliged to live in the same place, and sleep in the same room and bed with a man charged and afterwards executed for murder, with no other allowance than that of the prison, namely, bread and sixpence per week for nine weeks: that one *Thomas Riley*, confined in the same cell with the Petitioner, on a similar charge of a suspicion of High Treason, no doubt in a fit of derangement of mind, brought on by his confinement, cut his throat in the said prison, and on the day following, the Petitioner and another prisoner whom the Petitioner understood to be a convicted felon, were removed unto the very same cell in which the said *Riley* cut his throat, while the blood of the said *Riley* was still lying all over the floor, in a hard and congealed state: and the Petitioner and the said other prisoner were compelled to clean the same out with only a mop and broom, which, not being sufficient to remove the said blood, the Petitioner was obliged to scrape and take it up with his hands: that by this treatment his affairs and health are very much injured: to remedy things as far as he was able, he signed on the 5th of December a paper called a recognisance, although unconscious of any offence: wherefore, the Petitioner's circumstances being in a ruined state, and his health declining, he is led to pray for such relief as to the wisdom of the House shall seem meet: and that the House will cause inquiry to be made into the conduct of those by whom the Petitioner has been so cruelly treated, and will not pass any Bill of Indemnity to screen them from answering at Law for such unjust treatment of the Petitioner."

In the matter of the Petition of *Richard Lee*, late a prisoner in His Majesty's Gaol. the Castle of York.

*Richard Carlton*, of Full Sutton, in the East Riding of the County of York, late a prisoner under *sentence of confinement* in the Castle of York aforesaid, *maketh oath and saith*, that he was confined in the same room, along with, the above named *Richard Lee* and one *Thomas Riley*, now deceased, and had been so confined with them for the period of three weeks, previous to the time of the said *Thomas Riley* putting a period to his existence by cutting his throat: and this deponent also saith, that when he, *this deponent*, and the said *Richard Lee*, discovered what had taken place, which might to about *five* o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, the *seventh day of October* now last past. He, this deponent, called to the *watchmen*, who immediately called the *turnkey* and the *deputy gaoler*, all of whom came to the room, where he, *this deponent*, and the said *Richard Lee* and *Thomas Riley were confined*, when* Mr. Samuel Wilson*, deputy to *Mr. William Staveley*, the gaoler or keeper of the said castle, desired this deponent to lay the said *Thomas Riley* in a straight position on the bed, in which he was then laying, and undressed, which request he, this deponent, *immediately complied with*, that the said *Samuel Wilson*, *William Mentoft[?], the Turnkey*, and the *Watchman*, then withdrew, in order, as this deponent believes, to *send for the surgeon*: that the said *William Mentoft* returned to them in about ten minutes after or a quarter of an hour, and *conducted this deponent and the said Richard Lee* to another apartment, nearly adjoining to the room, in which they were then confined; that the said *William Mentoft* then left them, and again returned in about ten minutes more, when he asked the deponent, if he would have the goodness to clean up the blood in the room, in which the said Thomas Riley was then laying, previous to the Coroner and Jury being brought in: at the same time, saying that he, this deponent, should be recompensed for his trouble, and this deponent further saith, that he, this deponent, accordingly cleaned up the blood himself, without any assistance from the said Richard Lee, or an other person or persons whomsoever. And that the said Richard Lee did not assist, nor to this deponent's knowledge and belief, was ever required to assist in any way whatever to clean the room, or to do any other thing about the said Thomas Riley.

(Signed) RICHARD CARLTON.  
Sworn before me, Thomas C. R. Read, one of the visiting Magistrates at the Castle, at York, March 4th, 1818.

Observations by Mr. Allis, Clerk to the Magistrates, at Huddersfield, on the first part of Richard Lee's Petition.

Bradley, and Blythe, the Holmfirth Constable, went together: Blythe left Bradley to take care of Lee; no insult or abuse happened, but after Blythe went away, Lee said to Bradley, "you need not be afraid of my running away." Bradley replied, "No, you had better not attempt it, for if you do I will blow your brains out," or something to that effect.—"Bradley told this, because when Blythe was gone, he had no assistance, and was himself lame, having lost a foot.

Lee and his wife did talk about Lee's business and affairs, and he gave many directions about his business, and Bradley waited for a quarter of an hour. When Lee had changed his clothes, and arranged with his wife about his affairs, he told her that she might follow him to Huddersfield, either that day or the day following, and then they set off; he was not hurried away.

He was lodged in the best prison, which Huddersfield affords (which certainly is not the best or largest in the world). There was clean fresh straw every day, and it was daily washed, and watered by the constable. It was very hot weather at the time, and no one could be cold. His wife was told, that she could not see him without a magistrate's order. She afterwards applied to the magistrate, and did see him often.

Lee offered repeatedly to tell all he knew, if he might be permitted to be admitted as evidence, but he was told, that no promise could be made to him.

The place was not offensive, but clean and dry. As soon as ever a place of better accommodation could be found for the numerous prisoners, viz. in three or four days time, a house was taken, and Lee was then put into the best front bed room, with a chest of drawers, and a four post flock bed. He refused to have a bed, and wished for some straw. Straw was given him, and he put it upon his bed, and threw two quilts over it, and so crept in between them, because the weather was so intensely warm. All this was his own choice, and he repeatedly declared, that he was, and had been, more comfortable than at home, and had been much better attended to, and fed.

Observations by the Gaoler, at York, on Lee's Petition.

*Richard Lee*, whilst confined in York Castle, by his good and regular conduct, induced the gaoler to recommend him to Lord Sidmouth for his release. The gaoler was then led to believe Lee possessed some contrition in his mind for the offences which he had so frequently confessed to him, of his guilt, against the laws of his country: and under the faithful ?? of reformation, the gaoler was induced to petition Lord Sidmouth, in Lee's behalf.

On the day Lee left the castle, he addressed the Rev. Wm. Dealtry, one of the visiting magistrates, and expressed himself highly satisfied with the treatment he had received during his confinement, which he never failed to do whatever the Jailer conversed with him.

Both Riley and Lee were visited by the Grand Jury, on their inspection of the gaol, and no complaints were made. They had at all times access to their friends and relations. Their attendance at chapel was five times a week.

During the time Lee was confined, viz. twenty weeks, he had a single iron upon his right ancle, for the security of his person, weighing about five pounds, which is the usual practice of the gaol, and highly necessary in that part of the prison where Lee was confined.

His allowance (as directed by the Magistrates), was 1 1/2 pound loaf of good standard wheaten bread, *every morning*, with 6d. every Saturday to purchase some potatoes with. Coals found by the county, and in addition to the above allowance, 7s. 6d. per week, with which he frequently expressed himself well satisfied and thankful. He had every opportunity to obtain any other comfort he pleased (except liquor) of which one pint or bottle of ale was allowed. On his first arrival he was confined in the first yard, where only persons convicted of *small crimes and misdemeanors* are confined.

He was afterwards removed into a large room with Riley.—Wm. King was also confined in it, charged with the murder of his wife, and attended by two confiners, (not felons) who were well informed persons, and who, by the chaplain's direction, read good books to him. *King* was only *five* days in *Lee's* company, and no other felon was put in the same room with *Lee* during his confinement. He was allowed to walk, whenever he desired, in the yard allotted to prisoners in execution for small fines.

The room occupied by Riley and Lee, is 23ft. long, 13 1/2 f. wide, 15ft. high, and a fire place in the centre, so that the prisoner may have a fire day and night if he wished it. The day-room adjoining, is a long passage, 27f. long, 6f. wide, and 15f. high, and well ventilated.

Lee looked extremely well when he was discharged.

*Benjamin Whitely*, another of the band of *Patriots* who intended for us so many blessings, is the subject of the following letter:—

*To the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer*  
Holmfirth, 2d March 1818

Holmfirth, 2d March 1818.

Sir,—I am surprized, not a little, to find that our neighbour, Whitely, has been handing a Petition to the House of Commons, thro' the medium of the Hon. Mr. Bennett, for redress of grievances &c. and complaining of ill treatment during his confinement under the suspension act—'tis a pity but Mr. Bennett or any other Hon. Member would make themselves acquainted with the merit or demerit of any case, before such arrant trash as a petition from characters like Benj. Whitely, should be forced upon the notice of the House of Commons.

It is a fact generally known here, that during his confinement, Whitely in his letters to his wife, frequently boasted of kind treatment—to my certain knowledge, in one letter, dated Worcester, after stating what passed when he had an *interview* with Lord Sidmouth, &c. he goes on to say—I am now as happy as I could wish, if I had but your company—I have tea or coffee for breakfast—fresh dressed meat every day for dinner, with ale or porter at my option, an excellent bed, comfortable room, yard to walk in, &c. he further says, that as he is treated like a gentleman, he wishes to appear as such, and requests his wife to send him his best cloaths—All this he has confirmed since his return, adding that he had three pounds or guineas given him when he started to convey him home—and I am sure, if one may judge from his appearance, he has done well.

I apprehend, many of the complaints we hear of, are as ill-founded as this; and I think it right the Country should be properly informed. If this communication is of any service, I shall be glad, and, tho' you will omit noticing the author, I shall at any time be ready to offer most satisfactory proofs of its authenticity, if required.

+++

Amongst our authentic anecdotes of the late treasonable outrages, and our authentic narrative of the whole progress of the conspiracy, it will be remembered, we stated that Mr. Denman, Counsel for the prisoners, alluded to Old Tom Bacon, (one of the conspirators), and not to Oliver, in those observations in which he seemed to call upon the Attorney General to bring forth the principal agitator whose machinations had disturbed the peace of the country, and brought so many unfortunate men to trial for their lives. For this fact, we immediately had the dogs of sedition in full yell upon us. The Leicester Chronicle gave us the lie direct. The Leeds Mercury both denounced us as liars and demanded our authority. We are not in the practice of giving the names of persons furnishing information, especially to please those who are not to be convinced. But, as Mr. Bennett, in one of his recent speeches on the state of the country, confirmed the fact, he may, perhaps, feel more disposed to gratify the jacobin press than we are, by communicating the author of his information.

Mr. Bennett said, "if Bacon had been tried first, Oliver would have been a most important witness. He (Mr. Bennett) knew that Bacon's trial would have had a most important effect on those of the other prisoners, and that was the reason why that master traitor had been kept back altogether."

While we thank Mr. Bennett for this proof, that it was Bacon whom the Counsel for the prisoners wished to be brought forward, and for his admission that Bacon (one of the *innocent victims* to Oliver) was a *"master traitor,"* we beg leave to set him right in some particulars. Bacon was not kept back altogether. He pleaded *guilty*—was *convicted*—and in common with some others who thus threw themselves on the mercy of the Crown, was sentenced to *transportation for life*.

The Solicitor General and others, in the course of the same debate, clearly proved that Oliver had nothing to do with the prisoners, and that his production could have been of no advantage to them. And, the reason Bacon was called for so often by the Counsel for the prisoners, was, not that they thought they could have availed themselves of Oliver during his trial; but because they imagined the Attorney-General was keeping Bacon back, for the purpose of using him as an evidence in some further proceedings.

We believe the chief reason that Brandreth, Ludlam, Turner, and Weightman, were put on their trials before Bacon, was, that though Bacon was certainly one of the *"master traitors,"* the legal proofs were not quite so strong against him as against some of the others—and this very circumstance was a further motive for the prisoners' Counsel to wish him to be tried *first*. If the *master traitor* Bacon had been tried
first, and, from any defect of evidence, had been acquitted, it would have had a most *important*, and *glorious*, and *ever-to-be-rejoiced-at* effect on the trials of the *other traitors*—certainly.—The Attorney General, happily, *knew his business better*.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 30 March 1818

The inhabitants of this town were struck with astonishment, when they saw, from the Parliamentary reports, that *one hundred petitions*, signed by twenty persons each, praying for Reform, had been presented to the House of Commons, in the beginning of this month, *from the town of Leeds*! We have purposely abstained from making any remark on the circumstance, until it had produced, unaided, its full effect on the minds of our townsmen, and until we could dispassionately appeal to their reason, after they should have recovered from their surprise. We have not yet been able to learn that any one person, excepting the alleged petitioners themselves, knew these petitions were in progress in the town, or heard of them, until they were presented to the House! Petitions, signed by *two thousand persons*, if the signatures had been fairly and publicly obtained, must have made, one would think, noise enough in a place, however populous. One of two alarming facts, therefore, is the case. Either the petitions were signed by *two thousand* men, who are so closely *confederated*, and are bound to each other by such ties of *secresy*, that they could unite in this measure, and carry it into execution, without the knowledge of their fellow-townsmen, —or, supposing the signatures to have been chiefly surreptitious, there are a few persons in Leeds, who are daring and unprincipled enough to fabricate petitions, for the purpose of imposing upon Parliament and the country! In the former case, what security have we, that these *two thousand men*, who have proved that they can act *with secresy* and *in concert*, may not, in the prosecution of their wild and desperate projects, combine for purposes neither so lawful nor so peaceable as those of petitioning? In the latter case, it is evident that we have within the town, a band of close conspiring villains, whose readiness to adopt any daring and desperate measure, is proved by the unprincipled conduct they have already pursued.

It behoves the Public, and the Constituted Authorities, to be vigilant. As a local circumstance, we have no hesitation in saying, that the manner in which these petitions have been obtained, is one of the most seriopus facts that have occurred in the whole progress of the existing disaffection— one of the most serious indication, that the disaffected, or *reformers*, if they like it better, are in truth separated from the great body of the people—that they view their fellow subjects with hatred and distrust—and that they are prosecuting, or preparing to prosecute their schemes, not only without the concurrency of the country, but without its knowledge—in suspicious secresy and by falsehood and fraud.

We are not certain our information on another point is correct; but we have at the same time no reason for doubting its accuracy. We have been informed that Delegates have lately been sent from Huddersfield to London, for the purpose of renewing the machinations of last year. Should another concourse of these scoundrels from different parts of the kingdom, be now forming in the Metropolis, it will be rather curious to observe, while the disaffected writers and ??ators are still labouring to induce a belief that neither treason nor sedition exist in the country, that the Seditious, so soon as the Suspension Act has expired, are already resuming their unallowed labours.

From what we have shewn has so recently occurred in the town of Leeds, it is at least clear that they may be embarked in many projects of which the Public know nothing, and against which it will be well for Government and the Public to be on their guard.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 25 April 1818

TO THE EDITOR OF THE LEEDS MERCURY

Holmfirth, April 22, 1818

MR. EDITOR,-- In the multitude of evils which the unjust persecution I have endured has brought upon me, it is not one of the least to be forced into a correspondence of this nature; but justice to my own character requires it, and I submit to the task in the best manner I am able. In Mr. Staveley's letter, inserted in the Leeds Mercury of last week, he gives, *from memory*, the substance of a report made by the Committee of Magistrates deputed to inquire into his conduct towards me; but why publish this second-hand testimony of the party implicated in the inquiry which will satisfy nobody, and without the report itself, and the evidence on which it is founded, which might, if faithfully reported, satisfy every body. I have said, and I now repeat it, that I made no complaint in particular against Mr. Staveley, though I did complain of the measure of severity that was dealt towards me while in York Castle. I have reason to suppose that he acted by orders from above; and it is against his betters, and not against him, that my complaints are directed. He cannot deny, indeed he has admitted it repeatedly, that my behaviour during my confinement, was orderly and correct; and yet while I was confined in the "Gentleman's Room," about which he flourished before the Committee, I was held in fetters of iron, while my bed-fellow, who was charged with murder, was un-ironed, except by the chain which bound him to me. Poor Riley too, was chained to a criminal, and loaded with fetters, while our wretched companions in the "Gentleman's Room" were without manacles. Was our security more necessary than that of thieves and murderers? And how can Mr. Staveley justify himself for such treatment towards state prisoners, except by producing the instructions under which he acted? Was this treatment meant to drive me, as the treatment of poor Riley drove him to desperation; and was the horrid scene of cleansing the blood of this m————d man from the floor of our dungeon, meant to complete, what the chains and the company could not effect? Thank Him who strengthened me in the hour of trial for his preserving grace; and who has bid the innocent not to fear what men can do unto them. As to any parliamentary inquiry, I rather court than fear it— if it be not a *green bag* inquiry, where only *one side is heard*. Such an investigation, will neither satisfy me nor the country; but if parliament will go fairly and freely into the matter, secrets of the "prison house" will be disclosed, at which the basest tool of corruption will shudder, and every word contained in my petition, I will support by the oath of an innocent man, who had integrity enough to withstand the temptations held out previous to his committal, to allure him into the crooked paths of crime and infamy.

To Mr. Staveley's second Letter in the Intelligencer (a sight of which paper, can only be procured in our neighbourhood with extreme difficulty) I have only to say, that I appeal to the examinations themselves, taken before the Committee of Magistrates for the *substantial* accuracy of the report given by me of the examinations taken before them. To talk of "errors and falsehoods" "without entering into particulars," Mr. Staveley must know, is nothing better than to attempt to throw dust into the eyes of the public, who are too clear sighted to be imposed upon by such artifices. As to the postscript to my letter, he has either wilfully or unintentionally preverted *(sic)* its meaning. I did not say, nor did I insinuate, that Mr. Staveley had not applied to government for my liberation: what I said was, that I had not made any "confessions of guilt against the laws of my country," and that this could not be his reason for petitioning for my liberation. Let any man of common sense read my postscript, and Mr. Staveley's last letter, and say whether he has not grossly perverted the plain and intelligible language of that postscript. This is the more extraordinary, seeing that he is so *learned* a man as to feel himself at liberty to comment on my ignorance, which he says, is so gross, that he believes I could neither write nor even read the letters bearing my signature. Neither Mr. Staveley nor myself, have any great reason to reflect upon each other for want of learning. We are neither of us very eminent scholars; but I beg leave to inform him, that I can both read and write *almost* as well as the Governor of York Castle, and he might perhaps have made a little better figure in this correspondence had he got some "kind hearted friend" to be be *his* Amanuensis. Towards Mr. Staveley, I again repeat, that I have no hostility; he has complimented me upon my general good conduct—and I can with equal truth compliment him upon his general humane character. The severity practised towards me and the other innocent man, with whom I was committed to York Castle, while we were in his keeping, I impute to others, and not to him. He is only a servant, and acted no doubt, according to his masters' orders.

In taking leave of this subject for the present I beg leave to say, that the persecution I have suffered, is considerably diminished in its horrors upon my mind by the reflection that I have lived to justify my own character—that my enemies, and the enemies of their country, knowing my innocence, have not dared to bring me to trial, either on the charge for which I was originally committed, or for that on which I was afterwards unjustly detained—that to every unprejudiced mind it is made clear, that all I asserted in my petition to the House of Commons is true—and that the omnipotency of truth and innocency has enabled a humble individual like myself, to triumph over all the machinations of one of the most malignant and powerful conspiracies that ever assailed the lives and liberties of Englishmen.

I am, Sir, with great regard, yours,
RICHARD LEE.

P.S. It may not be amiss, in order to show the manner in which justice was administered in this neighbourhood during the reign of terror, to state, that my commitment to York Castle was signed by Joseph Haigh, Esq. although I had never been examined before that Magistrate.
