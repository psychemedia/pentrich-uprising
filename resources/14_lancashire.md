# Lancashire Ludds

Maybe more akin to current situation. Cotton mill industry was a new one, fed by cotton from the colonies and America, driven by machines from the start.

Lancashire Luddites were not preserving a tradition, they were trying to establish a tradition within a newly emerging industry.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 28 April 1812

 It is one the most painful duties our province to observe and record the desperate excesses as those of our countrymen who have so far machinations of triumph their good sense and every principle rectitude, to prompt them to acts which reduce them comparison with uncultured barbarians—with the very Goths and Vandals of antiquity. Let our artisans enquire of the aged, what were the numbers by fed our different branches of manufacture, before our machinery had acquired such perfection (for in most districts it is yet within the recollection of many), and they will soon be satisfied that the accumulation of goods in our warehouses is to be ascribed to the present deranged state of commerce throughout Europe, and not the multiplying power of machinery.

 On Tuesday evening, some the glass in Mr. Knowles's windows, of the Crown md Kettle, was broken, and on the following day the whole of the panes were demolished; since when we have heard of no farther outrage in this town, and we fervently hope it is the last we have to notice. There are several persons in confinement charged with being concerned in the several disturbances; many of whom are committed to Lancaster Castle.

 Monday, (as noticed in our last) the weaving mill of Messrs. Burton's, at Middleton, was attacked by an infatuated mob, who had assembled in immense numbers at a distance, from various quarters. They came nearly in one body instantly up to the building, fired a pistol, and then suddenly threw a shower of stones, which was so violent, that those who defended the place, began directly to fire over the heads of the rioter, in hopes they would desist; when the protectors of the Mill found the resistance that would be made, they continued to do so for some time, but finding their expectations disappointed, and the assault continued with desperate fury, and loud cries of "break in and murder them," they were obliged for preservation of their lives, to fire upon the mob, till in consequence of three men being killed and several wounded, two of whom afterwards died, they withdrew from, the factory.—They continued in the town destroying the furniture belonging to Messrs. Burton's servants, and threatening their lives, till a troop of Cavalry arrived from Manchester to their assistance. A Company of the Cumberland Militia arrived in the evening, and protected the Mill during the night. On Tuesday it was guarded by about fifty of the Militia, the mob, however, assembled in the course of the day, in still greater numbers, and proceeded to attack the house of Emanuel Burton, aster ransacking and dividing the spoil, they set fire to the house, barn, stables, &c., which consumed the whole, with the furnitures, valuables, fixtures, &c. The damage is supposed to be upwards of £2000. A troop of Cavalry arrived in the afternoon, who with great exertions, assisted by part of the Militia who had been detached from the Wearing Mill, and aster considerable firing, dispersed the multitude; three men were killed, with a  considerable number wounded. Since then, the town has been more peaceable, but the consequent has been, that about four hundred persons are thrown out of work, and reduced to great distress, and many of the workmen have been obliged to fly with their families frGm the town. The conduct of the Military has been highly praise-worthy. The number of the wounded is, we understand 27, nine of whom very severely.

 Early Monday week, the Market day at Rochdale, great crowds from the neighbourhood of Oldham, Royton, Heywood, and places adjacent, flocked in for the avowed purpose of lowering the prices of provisions, it having been previously intimated(?) by the evil-deposed persons that such an illegal act would then be effected. The parties placed themselves in groups of about fifty or sixty in different parts of the town, and each group endeavoured to collect around them the inhabitants of the town and country, by using inflammatory language, but much to the credit of the latter, few, if any, seemed disposed to join them. The military being directly called out, and aster the riot act had been read by Mr. Horton, the rioters were soon dispersed, without any other damage being done, and about eleven o'clock good order was restored. —Much praise is due to the Magistrates, for their timely and precautionary measures, and to the Military for their prompt attention to the civil power, and the readiness with which they quelled the disturbers of the public peace.

 A large Factory, at Westhoughton, near Bolton, was burnt down on Friday by about ?? incendiaries, but no material mischief has been about(?) the town. Several suspected persons are apprehended, and it was quiet at the date of our advices.

 A woman and two men were apprehended at Middleton yesterday morning, and safely lodged our New Bayley prison, for being concerned in the late riot there; the wotnau for heading up the party who J-.et fire to the work-people's furniture, &c. and the two men for assailing the factory windows, See 1 with stones. are deeply concerned to have to state that in 1 the neighbourhoods of Bolton, Chowbent, Leigh, and Tyldesley, secret system of riot and organ- : rebellion had been carried on for some time to an alarming extent: and on Friday the 21th ult. the rioters succeeded but too well in burning the ground a large weaving factory at • belonging to Messrs Wroe and Duncuft, of this town. It was known that many other factor!"* and mills were to meet toe same fate, and also the lives c»l many respectable persons were threatened. However, well-conceived project, most j-j li- ' executed, their secret meetings were dashed into—their private signals obtained—and a patient and persevering duty detachments of the Bolton Local Militia, their diabolical nocturnal assemblies were put confusion, their papers seized, ' and very Large number of their ring-leaders (together with a person they called General (the grand of impious rebellious oaths) have been secured, sent Lancaster Gaol. Amongst the, papers seized is a roll, containing list of names of great numbers implicated, all of whom the . punishment of their country awaits. The Magistrates are indefatigable. Much praise is due to and to his troop—to Capt. of the Greys, and his troop, who-e services have been eminent—but that which feel particular pleasure in promulgating is the steady, loyal, and conduct of the Bolton Regiment Local Militia, who upon every occasion act like veterans. A most wanton and wicked outrage was committed the night of Thursday week, the property Mr. John Drinkwater, respectable farmer, of Bugsworth, in •lie parish of.Glossop, the county of Derby. His wife, who occasionally acts a midwife, was called up at midnight, to attend a woman who was named her; but she had sooner opened the door than she was beset a number of ruffians who presented pistols and demanded hundred pounds of her. She said there was very little money in the house, but what there was they take. Upon this they rushed in, having their faces disfigured, and she opened to them all the drawers and cupboards, from which they took what they liked, including, twenty pounds in money, tell cheeses, twenty pair of shoes, blankets, pillow cases, &c. for six beds, besides all her husband's and children's cloaths. The ale and liquors in the cellars they drank or spilled on the place, brake pickle and preserve pois, scattering and trampling their con- » tents, together with a quantity of butter, crcam and other provisions on die Hoor. All this time a fellow stood over the husband he lay lied, brandishing a sword, and threatening him with instant death if he stirren. The honest m lay still, & he had a mod , reason lor doing, besides the sword chat "littered over his head, for under it was a case containing two hundred pounds in money, and the writings of his lit- i tie freehold. These the robbers did not find. When they had done tbeir.work, one who seemed to be the Captain called over their numbers front 1 to'lC and all having ".swered, they went away, carrying with t,;cm > or property lo .r ~ , I .£l5O. During robbery tv.., ' " guard the dojr of small' . , the only habitation near Mr. ; . v j' h , detachment from thelioyal !10, ..

Mr. llor.faM distinctly saw two them, but late guard offilu-Ir ctfrrf.—Mr. H. left Huddersfield with a manufacturer the name of Eastwood, the# together almost ;.> the fatal spot, wbetX,*' l.Vt^r stopped to give his horse some water, Mr. H. ,i n leisurely forwards.—At time the villains fired and the contents of their four pieces in the left side the unfortunate gentleman: instantly !■■ i " " rf distance the stirn; i ' very much. Several passengers, both | »»• -r-ebacic ami f >ot, soon •rani'? to the spot, aft disentangling him from the stirrup, conveyed the Warrener Inn, which is hard by the conf.i and alarm consequent such • lamentable occasion, no one had mind purs-tie the murderers: they escaped into Dungeon Wood, undiscovered. Nor was any pursuit or j search 1. after them till the arrival of a party of the Bays from Huddersfield. Mr. at first seamed much exhausted the great loss of blood. The best medical aid was obtained, and three shots out of the four were pronounced slight; but the fourth, from a musket-ball, had inflicted a mortal wound. —On Wednesday some faint hopes very were entertained, but in the course the a took thc became considerably swollen and had the appearance of ratification, and Thursday morning between 8 and 9 o'clock, death ensued. During the agonies such a state, there was some conflation that this public-spirited and humane man retained the perfect possession of his faculties. This one the most lamentable events that has ever been recorded our columns. The perpetration it has evinced a spirit, with which we had hoped, Englishman could have been actuated.—Mr hat! a most extensive manufactory Marsden, and employed near work-people; for the last seven years had worked shearing-frames in part of the premises and had brought them great perfection.—lie had been most active too, in endeavouring bring justice nocturnal assailants at RaWfolds.— lis property was too well defended for them to ri-k an attack; and therefore the villains sacrificed a valuable life means well worthy of Italian Bravo, but which must embitter trie remainder their days with sufferings ten thousand times more acute than they were able inflict, even if they should escape that end which the injured laws their country demand. The Luddites Nottingham, hear, have relliu|u.v,hed their system of frame-breaking to com-nit acts of much greater atrocity : Letters from thence communicate outrage perpetrated these men hardly to equalled for wantonness cruelty. On Monday night t, about o'clock, Mr. Trentham, of the house Trcntba:n, and Morton, in the weaving trade, was way-laid his return home by two and just he was about step his door, one them placed himself before him, and preheating a pistol, sl»ot him through the left breast, and then made his escape. The report of fire-arms having brought the neighbours the spot, surgical assistance v.as immediately procured, and the ball was extracted from the back, little below the left shoulder. Air. (though not entirely out of danger) is a fair way of recovery; years age. 

...

In the House Commons, Friday night, the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave notice, that Monday he would move for leave to bring Bill to extend the provisions of the Riot Act (which present were confined dwelling-houses) mills, manufactories, &c. Recent occurrences rendering this a very important consideration.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 09 June 1812

TO DO

SPECIAL COMMISSION.

CHESTER.

The following is Judge Dallas's most excellent charge to the Grand Jury; which, at their request his Lordship has permitted to be published:

*Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,*

It is not my practice, as you well know, to address any thing to you, on ordinary occasions, in the way of formal charge. The cases which are generally, in the Calendar, being of common occurrence, seldom require any particular remark, and, with the exception a single instance, which being of a special nature demanded special observation: I have never detained you beyond a few moments, from giving immediate attention to the business to be submitted to your inquiry. The service, however, which we are now called upon to perform, is of a more extensive and complicated nature, and may become, in many respects, both of fact and of law, of some nicety and delicacy execution.

Of their magnitude and importance, it scarcely necessary for me to speak, nor to inform you that we are now assembled, not in the common course of public duty, but under a Commission: which, on behalf his Majesty, his Royal Highness, the Prince Regent has thought fit to direct, for the general delivery of the gaol of this county, but which at present is confined to the respective trials the prisoners now in custody, under charges having been concerned in the several riotous and felonious practices that have of late taken place; and which, tending to the subversion of all order and Government, demand early enquiry, and if the result should render unfortunately necessary, early example.
  
  And, Gentlemen, tracing the outline the duty discharged, from the Calendar, with which am furnished, I lament to observe, that it is not only grievous in respect to the number of commitments, but equally so, in the modes and varieties offence, comprising almost every sort crime which guilt, diversified into all its forms and shapes can present, and calling for the application of numerous common law and statuary provisions; with to some of which, connected with the bills indictment, to be submitted you, it may proper that I should make a few observations. The least and lowest the list, though the root and origin from which all the others appear spring, is the charge of riotous and tumultuous assembling : taken simply, and itself, it is a misdemeanor only ; but it is the peculiar property of this even | when the least criminal, in its conception, soon to change its original cast and character: and what ' fsrst was, perhaps, bet a disorderly meeting, more for the purpose clamour and complaint, than for any serious, and still less felonious mischief, branches out, as it proceeds, into every species of crime, j running thr.-ugh the ranee capital offences, and often terminating the guilt high treason itself. Confining, however, our present consideration ! the charge riot, an offence at common law, : more or less criminal, according the circumstances of the particular case, can do better than give you the description, it to found books of authority. "â¢A Riot, says Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, seems tc a tumultuous disturbance of the peace three 41 person* or mere Assembling together their own " authority,-with,ao iutcr.t mutually to assist one 44 another, against any who shall oppose them in 44 the execution of some enterprise of a private na-44 lure, and after wards actually executing the same " in violent and turbulent manner, to the terror ** the people, the act intended were of itself lawful or unlawful.' It not necessary to follow the detail into which he afterwards proceeds; but for the purpose of immediate utility, one or two points enly need further slated. 44 seems, says, to lie certain, that if a person 14 seeing other*, actually engaged in a riot, join 44 himself with them, and assist them therein, is 44 much rioter he had with them at 44 first, for the same purpose." And as the degree of violence or terror which the intended enterprise must executed, it appears, addsâ 44 To be clearly agreed, that in every riot there must be some circumstances either actual force and viott or at least an apparent tendency thereto, .. aS nat Â»rally apt strike a terror into i- Â«e, as the shew of armour, threatening " s^ erf,t i . turbulent gestures, for every sucli " tho l" 1 " T" '' l: l ' ollc to 'lie terror of the people: and this fini .hes what I have to say you the subject of mUdemeanon. are r tho C e^Â» 'i CaWS, which 1 ha aJTCtt, arc tlio,e of felonies, not capital. PuWic"'and'nf ' forem ? st m P o!nt of danger to the ' â¢ a " d . of Proportionate guilt the individuals Utrmca Â° f Â« administering treasonJÂ£Â» r e "? Sement, which may ' 9 according the circumstances the particular ease, but wl.idi, d, wi come before you in the shape felony only. Considered in th;s light, iÂ«; offence a particular fttult, and ipplin descriptions personsthose taking an unlaw! oath or obligation, and imposing it; both whom are put upon same footing in port criminality âsuch conduct, instance, beÂ«' declared to felony, and subject, sit t'nediscrcti of t'ne Court, to transportation for -.even years. With respect the nature of the oath or engagement, it appears me that the best direction I give you be, lo refer to the the evidence before you with the description it co tains; and I sav the evidence, for it not the express words the oath should state in ? indictment, the statute providing that it shall sufficient set fjith the purport, some mater part thereof. And a-; what shall can ide. taking the oath or cement, here, you w be relieved from all difficulty, for itÂ»Â¦Â» declared, tt any engagement or obligation whatever, in ture oath, shall deemed octli, intent and meaning of the Act, whatever form manner the shall i, ar J it shail administered any person, any oti person, tfcken without any administration, by s, person himself. Nor will it be any justiiicadi should the fact so, that the oath was compulsion, unless the party taking within four days, if not prevented sickness, actual force, have declared the fame, and the win of his knowledge respecting it, the manner Act points out. This, of course, generally sped, matter defence to come from the ac'M ! ed but I mention it along, as the circumstance of compulsion, might, by possibility, app< j in some such case, and leave you at a loss for its 1 operation and effect, unless the provision of 1 j statute were flut. And here again, Cent men, finally quitting this subject, 1 of you consider whatever falls from me, as intended to direct you the sources of legal in!" mation, than as stating with exactness and pre.. ' ! what the law is: will therefore be more saf.M" me, ar.d more profitable to yourselves, shot any case 3 difficulty occur, refer the letter the law, which, of course, von will have before yÂ« ' and if any doubt arises upon the meaning or c. ' struction, to apply lo the Court. I now conic to offences of a capital nature, and those the case robbery: that tdcing from the p son by violence or putting in fear, will require y particular attention. To constitute the crime of robbery, there must a taking from the person force, or by putting fear, which supplie; the place of force; and there? in common cases, this evidence easily understood and easily established, for man can doubt is force or violence: and the threat of violence self putting fear. I*i the common ins*ancethe fore, of a highway robbery, difficulty â¢" arising upon the truth of the story told, the ic titv of the accused. The eases which will become before you, may, many respects, not prove of so plain and character, and therefore it is necessary I should few leading principles, as to be found in the bo. of criminal law, Cr settled cases a similar description. I say, nothing to actual violence, for that r perty obtained, will amount to robbery, is i! which precludes the possibility of doubt. The ficulty (if any) will arise upon what is putting fear. And it clear that a threat of violence, such as lo induce man of common firmness to ascertain apprehension for his safety, in law, putti in fcai. On the threat of violence therefore, as actual violence itself, no difficulty is likely occur. But the difficulty (if any) can only be ci ed the consideration of hat in law is a threat, as to constitute putting fear. Now. with rc'pcct to this, it clear that thr need not threat words, for even request terms, meant only a cover for a threat, intended to operate a threat, and accompan < circumstances to live that operation, a . thereby excite fear, will much putting fear, (tired kÃmre, .r.e dim - all such will a mere enquiry 'act, pending upon the precise circumstv.ees the particular case; was the a pretence, and notli more ? But not leave this too much large, Â£c ; ing uncertainty, from any or | sta;e;uent on part, will mention you , substance of leading case, applicable the your best guide this occasion. 1 During the Riots in London, the 17 boy, with a cockade his ha', knocked at the door of the pro mentor, who opened it; , 1 boy said, 'Â¦ God bless you! remember the p mob;" the prosecutor told go -along, , ; which he said, 41 then I will go and fetch my C ; tain j"âlie went, and the mob, the amount PlO3, armed with sticks, and what else they co [ i get, soon after came, headed by man he: I back, having his horse Jed the same boy; their coming up, the byc-standers said, 14 you give them money, ' r.n the boy said, 44 no.v brought my Captain " Some the mob .i 4Â£ this gentleman always generous." The pro I cuter then .cd the prisoner how much ? who "haifacrown, Sir;" on which the pio the prisoner half a crown, and this Â» to robbery. One other circumstance may, however, p per to mention, and which is, that sufficien 1 the property be taken the presence of the ' it need not be taken immediately from his per* so that there be violence his person or put ' him fear.âAnd further add, threat to property, will have the sameeil with threat of personal violence, to destroy ui.i house, and cases of a similar description, Beyond this, I have also to point your attention to a different description .a.-, of which I ft i there are many the calendar, and that is, i compelling a party, under pretence buying, part with property for less than it is worth: tula . clearly robbery. It is not necessary (indeed it might other* than useful) pursue any of those subjects m into detail Whenever the principle of law suit from matter of fact, slight circumstances make the distinction between guilt and innooc legally considered ; and therefore, the it general illustration, no safe or steady li can allbrded. the remaining I am not v that particular remark will necessary. Beginning pull down, or to demolish house, fire it, burglary, stealing a dwelling-house amount of shillings, setting lire to mill, these are capital offences, but V'U depend for th investigation, merely upon in proof; will also another set of cases, bv the 22 C. 41, are made capital that the stroyiugany .ilk cotton manufacture the 100 any tools or utensils employed in the them, or during the day or night breaking Into & house or shop with such intent. And, now Gentlemen, I have adverted a / neral way, more at length than inclinati would have led me do. but obedience to wl I feel my duty, the several ofTenccs, which in form of bills of indictment, are likely to fore you. With this general exposition, rati allusion to what the law is, the task havÂ« unpo upon myself brought to close ; end beyond line and limit of judicial duty, I neither nor do I tliink it proper advance a single s what circumstances these disorders what may have been the remote, and w,Mt P ximate causes, have no precise knowle Jge, nor t means of forming anv very satisfactory coujectur ami certainly much lJÂ« Â», 'ban r siding upon the spot. That oi the multitacles sembled upon so many different occasions, there m not have been many induced to it by the pressure 

 ... tiws; Â»!ut there iTmy not others e..l example the moment, it would not only >kj table, but unjust to suppose. But I fear there reason to apprehend, that much the (Character of these dreadful outrages is different description: the printed hand-bills, which have circulated some time past; the discourses which have been held; the doctrines which have been published ; the hopes held out the disaffected; and the threats made use of to the well-disposed; and lastly, and aliove aTI that which was before surmised, but will now distinctly appear, at least in point of existence, though not of extent, the secret binding equally the commission arid concealment of crime : this cement and consolidation of ell conspiracy; this stamp and treason itself! All these, put together, denote, and too plainly, for prudence to disregard; the instrumentality wicked instigation working to the production of something more than local or partial mischief.

The High Sheriff, Edward Greaves, Esq. arrived here on Saturday, and, in the afternoon, proceeded to meet the Judges, the Hon. Baron Thomson and Sir Simon Le Blanc, who arrived here soon after six in the evening, and opened the Court at the Castle. The next morning, they attended divine service at St. Mary's Church, where an excellent discourse was delivered, by the Rev. Dr. Smith, the Sheriff's Chaplain, from Proverbs xxiv 21 —On Monday morning, the Grand Jury were sworn in whose names are as follow:

Joseph Radciiffe, of Royton, Esq. Foreman,

Edmund Rigby, of Ellel Grange,  
Benjamin Rawson, of Darley,  
Miles Sandys, of Graithwaite,  
John Silvester, of Chorley, and  
John Simpson, of Hope, Esquire.

An admirable Charge was given to them, by Baron Thomson, in which he stated the law which applied to the different cases which would come before them. Persons breaking into warehouses, mills, or shops, and setting fire to them, or stealing or destroying any goods therein, were guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy. Persons guilty of administering or aiding and consenting to the administering of unlawful oaths, were liable to seven years transportation. He concluded with exhorting them to use their utmost endeavours, in their respective neighbourhoods, to restore and promote the public tranquillity.

The Court adjourned soon after the Charge was delivered, till eight o'clock on Tuesday morning, when twelve men and two women were put to the bar, for setting fire to (or aiding and assisting therein) the weaving-mill, warehouse, and loom-shop, of Thos. Rowe and Thos. Duncough, of Westhoughton. Their trial lasted till eight at night, when the Jury retired for upwards of an hour, and brought in a verdict of *Guilty* against Abraham Charlton (aged 16) Job Fletcher (34) Thos Kerfoot (26) and James Smith (31) — and *Acquitted* John Bromilow, Wm. Kay, Bold Haworth, John Shuttleworth, John Charlson, Mary Cannon, Lydia Molyneux, Samuel Radcliffe, Robert Woodward, and Adam Bullough. The Court then adjourned till Wednesday morning, at nine, when twelve prisoners were put to the bar, charged with aiding and consenting to the administering an unlawful oath to Holland Bowden, a Serjeant in the Bolton Regiment of Lancashire Local Militia. Their trial lasted till near seven o'clock, when the Jury retired for above half an hour, and brought in a verdict of *Guilty* against Christopher Medcalf (41), James Brierley (30), Henry Thwaite (24), Thomas Pickup (51), John Hurst (37), Samuel Radcliffe (35), who was acquitted yesterday of setting fire to the factory at Westhoughton, and Joseph Greenhalch (22) — and *Acquitted* Joseph Clement, William ifford, John Hays, Peter Topping, and James Knowles; when the Court adjourned till eight o'clock on Thursday morning, when five men and one woman were put to the bar, charged with riotously assembling, with many other persons, at the house of John Holland, Deansgate, Manchester, and breaking the door and windows, and stealing a large quantity of bread, cheese, and potatoes; — when John Howarth (30) John Lee (46) and Thomas Hoyle (27) were found *Guilty*, and Henry Ashton, Richard Southern, and Phebe Smith, were *Acquitted*. After which, John Kenyon (40) Abraham Ogden (21) Paul Greenwood (26) Robert Ogden (24) John Scholes *alias* Wragg (19) and James Taylor (25) were tried for being concerned in a riot at Middleton, during which riot the house and stable of Mr Emanuel Button were feloniously set on fire; and were all *Acquitted*.

Yesterday, Thomas Brookes (27) was *Acquitted* of having, with upwards of 100 persons, entered the house of John Cooke, of Pendleburv, and obtained two Bank one pound notes, by putting him in fear. — Hannah Smith (54) was found *Guilty* of highway robbery, in stealing butter out of a cart, at Ardwick, Manchester.—She was afterwards found *Guilty* of larceny, in stealing a quantity of potatoes, at Bank Top, Manchester, the property of James Radcliffe. — Ann Butterworth, daughter of Robert (19) Samuel Howarth (17) Alice Partington (42) Millicent Stoddard (28) Ann Butterworth, daughter of William (19) and Ann Dean (20) were also found *Guilty* of being concerned in the riots ai Middleton.— The Court then adjourned till this morning.

A true bill for a misdemeanor, in being concerned in the late riots at Middleton; having been found against the six prisoners who were acquitted on Thursday of setting fire to Mr. Burton's house, they were brought up yesterday, and traversed till next Assizes. They were ordered to find bail for their appearance, themselves in 200*l.* each, and two sureties in 100*l.* each; and Mr. Burton, and two witnesses, were bound over to prosecute and give evidence.

Counsel for the prosecutions, Mr. Park (Attorney-General for the county) and Messrs. Topping, Walton, and Holroyd; and for the prisoners, Messrs Raincock and Addison, jun. No other Counsel have attended here during the week.

The Grand Jury, on leaving the Court yesterday, were informed by the Judge, that they must not consider themselves as formally discharged, as their services might be wanted again before the next Assizes, which, however, he hoped would not be the case.

There are three prisoners for rioting, one for burning a hovel, and seven for aiding in administering unlawful oaths, yet to take their trials.—*Further particulars in our next.

Hurst, who was convicted on Wednesday, was the man who went by the appellation of General Ludd; — and Smith, capitally convicted on Tuesday, is a lame man, walking with a crutch.

On Monday last, the Hon, R. Dallas and F. Burton arrived at Chester, and opened the Special Commission for the trial of the rioters, &c. in the Castle there, which were 42 in number, charged with rioting, settinp fire to a house, others with administering and taking an unlawful oath, also with breaking into mills, houses, warehouses, &c. and others with breaking machinery.

At the Special Sessions, held at Preston, on Thursday last, it was ordered that the Watch and Ward Act should be put in force in this and most of the other parishes in the hundred of Lonsdale, and several parishes in other hundreds.— *See the advertisement.*

Lancaster Gazette - Saturday 06 June 1812

TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS, &c. AT LANCASTER CASTLE,

*Before the Hon Baron Thompson and Sir Simon Le Blanc. — Concluded from our last.*

On Saturday, the following prisoners were found *Guilty*, viz. John Hope (aged 33) and Samuel Crossley (28) for rioting at Worsley, and stealing a large quantity of grain and flour out of a mill; Ann Hame (43) for a similar offence at Barton-upon-Irwell; John Burney (49) for aiding and assisting in administering an unlawful oath to Isaac Clayton, a private in the Royal Cumberland Militia; and James Knowles (21) who had been acquitted on another indictment on Wednesday, and John Fisher (21)) for taking an unlawful oath, at Bolton.

On Monday, Thomas Holden (20) was found *Guilty* of taking an unlawful oath, at Bolton; and Peter Smith (46) and Thomas Shelton (19) were *Acquitted* of a similar offence. Smith and Shelton were again brought to the bar, with Arthur Holden (33) James Holden (20) Wm. Holden (17) and James Itherwood (26) charged with riotously assembling together, but the indictment omitting to state that it was for an unlawful purpose, the Attorney-General gave up the prosecution, and they were of course *Acquitted*.

Baron Thompson then, in a most solemn manner, proceeded to pass sentence upon those prisoners who had been convicted, in nearly the following terms:

"John Hurst, Christopher Medcalfe, James Brierley, Henry Thwaite, Joseph Greenhalgh, Samuel Radcliffe, Thomas Pickup, John Burney, James Knowles, John Fisher, and Thomas Holden.—The country has been engaged in a most serious enquiry into the causes and into the consequences of the most outrageous disturbances that have ever been observed, and the consequence of that enquiry has been the conviction of several who were concerned in them; some of you who now stand at the bar have been found guilty of administering, or aiding and consenting thereto, and others of taking, unlawful oaths, not to discover or reveal certain persons who were engaged in such practices, and binding yourselves to be associate with them. It is but too probable that many of the offences which have disgraced this county have been committed in consequence ot the administering of such oath. We have heard repeated a part of the terms used in it, and they are such as to make one shudder. You have been engaged deeply in these transactions, you have assembled with others in a large body, and have enrolled all those who were willing or desirous to join you. The greater part of you stand convicted ot having administered the oath to an innocent person, not willing to take it, and whom you apprehended to be a spy; I mean those in the case of Holland Bowden. You had been attending that unlawful assembly upon the moor, and upon your road from it, it was the misfortune of this man to meet with you; under the threat and terror of being shot, you compelled him to take the oath. It is extremely probable, that at this time, on the 17th April, you had planned the destruction of the West Houghton mill and warehouse, for it was in evidence upon your trial, that conversation about the mill had been held, that delegates were sent to see in what state it then was, and how it was guarded; it was also mentioned, in the course of that conversation, that a feint would be made, to endeavour to deceive the military; and too well did these intentions succeed, for upon the 24th that mill was destroyed, which appeared to have been the object of your lawless vengeance for some time. This is the name of the crime of which you, the seven first prisoners, are now at the bar. You, John Burney, are not charged with being present at that time, but with having been present and consenting to the administration of an unlawful oath to one Isaac Clayton, who was a soldier in the militia, the purport of which was similar to the other. Though it was not actually administered by you, yet it was in your hearing, and with your consent; for so the Jury have very wisely determined, by their verdict. The effect intended by the administration of this oath was of the most alarming nature; no less than the overthrow of Government. You, John Fisher, James Knowles, and Thomas Holden, have been found guilty of taking the like unlawful oath. It was urged in your behalf that you went to this meeting merely out of curiosity, and to see what was to be done. But when you went, you could not but know that it was met for an unlawful purpose; the watchword was given, and it was hoped that none were there who did not know the object of the meeting; and after the full knowledge you had of it, you, the three prisoners, did actually, without hesitation, take the oath which was required of you. You, James Knowles, too well observed the nature and purport of the oath, for you were one of those present when Holland Bowden was compelled to take it, and you were indicted for assisting in that act. The offence for which you and the other prisoners are now at the bar has been provided against by an Act passed eleven years ago, and unhappily there is now occasion for it to be called into force. The wisdom of the Legislature has decreed, and the judgment of the Court is, that you be severally transported to some part beyond the seas for the term of seven years.

"James Smith, Thomas Kerfoot, Job Fletcher, Abraham Charlson, John Howarth, John Lee, Thomas Hoyle, and Hannah Smith. — The awful moment has now arrived in which you are to receive that sentence which the laws of your country have awarded against those atrocities of which you have been guilty, and for the which your lives are forfeited. The result of the investigation into the several charges against you is, that you have all been guilty of these acts of violence and outrage, riotously and tumultuously assembling together, and committing depredations against the property of those who have been the objects of year unlicensed attacks. Four of you have been convicted of burning the mill at West Houghton, and destroying machinery the most useful. At that scene of despair you were seen conducting yourselves with circumstances productive of the utmost terror, and particularly active in forwarding its destruction; and you must atone for it with your lives. Three others of you have been convicted of breaking and entering the house and shop of a man, wno was in it, together with his family, at the time, and of stealing bread, potatoes, and several other articles, in short, plundering him of nearly the whole contents of the shop. It was beset with great numbers, and became the object ot your fury, because the owner had refused to accede to your exorbitant demands. It is highly necessary that this should be punished severely. You, Hannah Smith, have been found guilty of a robbery on the highway of a large quantity of butter, seizing the prosecutor's cart, and assisting in carrying away nearly the whole of the contents, without him having been paid any price for it; you have also been convicted of stealing a quantity of potatoes. This circumstance seems to prove that you were one of the most determined enemies to good order, and it is fit to be understood, that sex is not entitled to any mitigation of punishment, when the crime is of such a nature as to deserve it. In the awful state in which you stand, who are now before me, and who must shortly leave this world for another, I feel it my bounden duty to exhort you to consider your situation, to make yourselves sensible of your crimes, to confess your sins before God, and to implore his mercy; and may all within these walls, and without, wherever these tidings may reach, take warning from your example, and observe, that they cannot, with impunity, conspire to disturb the public tranquillity; for whatever they may think, though they may suppose themselves to be beyond the reach ot the law, justice may overtake them; and though you may not have intended to go the lengths you have, yet who can say, "thus far will I go and no further?"— Suffer me to exhort you to set about the great work of repentance, that you may obtain that mercy hereafter, which cannot be shewn you here. It now only remains for me to pronounce that sentence which the law has adjudged. Hear that sentence. This Court does adjudge, that you, the several prisoners at the bar, be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there to be hung by the necks till you are dead; and may the Lord have mercy upon your souls!"

Of the foregoing eleven prisoners, sentenced to be transported, Holden, Knowles, and Fisher, were for taking an unlawful oath, at Bolton; and the remainder for aiding and assisting in the administering of unlawful oaths, at Bolton.

Of the eight prisoners condemned, Hannah Smith, was for rioting and highway robbery, at Manchester; Charlson, Fletcher, Kerfoot, and Smith, for rioting and burning the mill, at West Houghton; and Haworth, Lee, and Hoyle, for rioting and breaking into a house, and stealing provisions, at Manchester.

John Hope and Samuel Crossley, for rioting and stealing at Worsley, were also sentenced to seven years transportation.

Ann Hamer, for rioting and stealing flour, at Bolton-upon-Irwell, was fined 1s and sentenced to six months hard labour in the House of Correction, at Preston.

Ann Butterworth, Samuel Howarth, Alice Partington, Ann Butterworth, Millicent Stoddard, and Ann Dean, for rioting, at Middleton, were sentenced to six months imprisonment.

The Judges presided alternately at the trials of the prisoners. They left this town, for London, on Tuesday morning.— The eight capital convicts are left for execution, which we are informed is to take place on Saturday next, the 13th inst.

At Chester Special Assizes, which ended on Saturday last, fourteen prisoners received sentence of *Death*, viz. Collin Lindon (aged 45) James Wilson, alias Roach (23) Poller Roach (18) James Bennet (21) Richard Wood (27) and William Thompson (23) for unlawfully assembling in Edge Etchels, and by numbers and intimidation, feloniously obtaining from John Parker, Esq. the sum of seven shillings— Richard Lowndes (40) James Torkington (18) and John Kenshall (28) tor a riot, and obtaining divers sums of money from several of the inhabitants of Pownall, Fee, and Styall. — William Greenhough (48) for rioting at Tintwistle, and unlawfully entering the shop of Elice Berry, and taking away a quantity of flour — Joseph Thompson (24) for stealing a silver soup ladle, a quantity of silver spoons, and other articles, the property of John Goodair, of Edgeley — John Temples (27) for riotously assembling at Adlington, and stealing a quantity of silver spoons and wearing apparel, the property of Samuel Wagstaff— James Crossland (49) and John Heywood (18) tor breaking and destroying machinery, at Tintwistle.— Lowndes, Thompson, Greenhough, Temples, and Heywood, are left for *execution*.

John Ellis, capitally convicted of destroying machinery, ar Tintwistle, *sentence respited*.

John Jackson, William Stubbs, and Thomas Livesley, tor rioting at Macclesfield; Jackson and Stubbs *to be imprisoned three years*, and Livesley *one do. in common gaol* — Charles Hulme and John Nield, for rioting at Cheadle Bulkeley, *imprisoned one year in common gaol*. — John Hamlet, Thomas Chadwick, William Woodhall, John Graham, Peter Leigh, and William Hancock, for rioting at Baguley, *pleaded guilty, and entered into recognisances in 10l. each, for keeping the peace for one year* — Samuel Lees, Thomas Burgess, Thomas Brunt, *alias* Etchels, and James Radcliffe, for riotously assembling and entering the mill of Joseph Clay, at Bradbury, and taking away and destroying a quantity of flour; William Walker, for inciting the mob to acts of tumult and disorder, at Gee Cross; and Edward Redfern, for entering, with others, the corn mill of the proprietors of the Huddersfield canal, at Staley Bridge, *to be transported seven years, and pay a fine of 1s* —Nancy Hurst, for stealing flour at Staley Bridge, *imprisoned one year in the House of Correction* — Thomas Whittaker, for administering an unlawful oath, at Etchels, and John Bradshaw, for taking the same, to be *transported for seven years* — James Renshaw, indicted on two bills for rioting at Etchels, acquitted on one, pleaded guilty to the other, and *discharged on his own recognizance*. — William Lomax, William Moles, and Joseph Shofield, for rioting at Cheadle Bulkeley, *entered into recognizance for their appearance when called upon*.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 07 July 1812

CHESTER CIRCUIT. *Robert Dallas, Esq.* — *Francis Barton, Esq.*

*Cheshire.*—Wednesday, August 19, at Chester.

It was expected that Parliament would be prorogued about the 10th of July, in order to afford Members the opportunity of attending the Assizes in their respective counties; but from the quantity of business yet to be transacted, it is probable this expectation will not be realised.

Potatoes have this year been planted an unusual extent throughout the country.

On Friday, a *Luddite* of the name Barrowclough, charged with the atrocious crime of twisting-in, was brought from the edge of Yorkshire to the New Bayley Prison, in a post chaise, escorted by a party of Dragoons.

The *Sheffield Mercury* of Saturday last furnished us with the following information; probably the man in the preceding paragraph is the person alluded to:

"At a late hour last night we received highly important and very gratifying intelligence to every friend of peace and good order. It states that two Bow Street Officers have been in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield for nearly three weeks past and that they had been *Twisted in*, or in other words had taken the oath of the Luddites. By this means they have learned the proceedings and ways of these infatuated persons, and have obtained the knowledge of the depot where their arms were concealed. Warrants were yesterday (Friday) issued for the apprehension of Fifty of the ringleaders and in the course of the day a great number of them were taken into custody. The actual Murderer of Mr. Horsfall was discovered in a house about eight miles from Huddersfield, and is committed to Lancaster Castle to be tried for the barbarous deed. He was seized yesterday morning about two o'clock within the county of Lancaster. The Queen's Bays were on duty during thew hole of Thursday night and yesterday morning; and the Scotch Greys have arrived from Manchester to assist them in this business. LET THE GUILTY FEAR AND TREMBLE.

James Oldroyd, of Dewsbury, clothier, was committed last week to York Castle, charged upon oath with having on the night of Monday the 22d June ult. at the Sign of the Black-Bull, in Mirfield, confessed that he was at Rawfold's Mill on the night it was attacked, that he was engaged in that attack and that he was near to his fellow-creature when he fell.

A short time before the execution of Thompson, at Chester, he acknowledged, that a regular organization of disaffected manufacturers had existed some time in Cheshire, Lancashire, the Northern Counties, and in Scotland—that there are concealed depots of arms—and that this confederacy owes its origin to the intrigues of men of EXALTED RANK, but whose names he was unacquainted with. Those engaged in this conspiracy have taken the diabolical oath, which has before appeared in this paper—with the tenor of which Thompson was well acquainted, having been sworn of the compact. This was not ascertained on his trial. We had nearly omitted mentioning, that the avowed object of this infernal association is to overturn the government, and establish on its ruins a Commonwealth, 'similar to that under Oliver Cromwell!' On this disclosure we leave the reader to his own reflection!

TO DO

 At Chester, the Special Commission to try the Cheshire offenders sat during the last week of May `[See Manchester Mercury, June 9, 1812; and H,O. 42. 123, May 30. See p. 274 above.]` Mr. Justice Dallas and Mr. Justice Burton were the Judges. Forty-four prisoners awaited trial, but of these, one was admitted evidence, three were acquitted, and twelve, most of them charged with rioting, were let off on their own recognisances, leaving twenty-eight to receive sentence. Of these twenty-eight no fewer than fourteen received the death sentence, but though five of these fourteen were reserved for execution, in the end only two were hung, Joseph Thompson, a weaver of thirty-four, who had stolen some silver and set fire to a house at Edgeley, and John Temples, a weaver of twenty-seven, who had stolen silver spoons and clothes at Adlington. Of the other twelve sentenced to death and respited, only three were convicted of attacks on machinery : these were James Grassland, a shoemaker of forty-five, John Heywood, a carder of eighteen, and John Ellis, occupation not stated. They were found guilty of breaking machinery at Tintwistle. The other capital convictions were for riots and obtaining money or flour at various places. In addition to the capital convictions, eight men were sentenced to transportation for seven years, six of them for stealing flour at corn mills, and two for illegal oaths. These last two were John Bradshaw and Thomas Whittaker,3 the latter a ' man of superior ability

and education,' for whose conviction the prosecution were particularly urgent.1

 The case against these men and against three others who were acquitted or not proceeded against rested on the sole evidence of one John Parnell.2 Mr. Lloyd of Stockport had gone out, in his capacity of captain of the local militia, on April 1,5 to disperse an assembly, and in the course of proceedings John Parnell was caught. Afterwards, under Mr. Lloyd's care, he confessed that he had on April 6 received an illegal oath from Thomas Whittaker. ' None of the persons in custody sworn at the same time are inclined to corroborate the Testimony of Parnell, because it is evident they are so ignorant as to conceive themselves under the obligation imposed by the diabolical oath not to tell of one another.' Mr. Lloyd, however, managed to scrape up corroborating evidence of ' various minute circumstances ' and Whittaker's conviction was secured. Six more prisoners, one of them a woman, were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of one or three years for rioting or stealing flour. Of the various prisoners, it may be noticed that a good many were colliers, one of whom, William Walker, who had incited a mob to disorder and tumult at Gee's Cross, was dignified by the name of General Ludd. Thompson and Temples were not executed till June 21. Thompson gladdened the hearts of the authorities by making a rambling dying confession, declaring that a rebellion existed and that things were to be like Oliver Cromwell's time.3

 The trials for offences in Lancashire took place before a Special Commission at the end of May and beginning of June 1812. The Judges were Baron Thomson and Mr. Justice Le Blanc. It seems possible that their selection was one of Perceval's last acts before his assassination. ' Mr. Perceval,' he wrote on May 6,4 in a private letter to the Home Secretary who had written to him on the subject of the Special Commission for Lancashire, c does not conceive that it is or can be his official Duty to select the Judges, as would appear to be implied by the terms of Mr. Ryder's letter.' He adds, however, that if on inquiry he finds that he ought to do so he will make the selection. Whoever was responsible for the selection

made sure that the rioters in Lancashire should not meet with the leniency for which Mr. Justice Bayley had been blamed elsewhere.

  The question of the necessity of using the evidence of spies to convict the prisoners from the Bolton district had much exercised Colonel Fletcher. ' We are shy of bringing these Witnesses forward,' he wrote on April 30,1 'being desirous to cover over our Intelligence even with a Shadow rather than exhibit the Sources to open Day' A week later it was decided to use evidence from what might be termed the piecework spies, in contrast to Stones and his father who were employed on a time-work system.2 By May 21, however, it was evident that the testimony of the ' main Informants ' would be necessary, but the informers themselves had fallen under suspicion. ' His ' [that is John Stones'] ' Father, Simon Stones,' wrote Colonel Fletcher,3 * who was the Leader of those Ten Men — amongst whom some others of our Confidents were introduced to the Meeting of the 19th April — has since the Committals to Lancaster become suspected, and the suspicion has been extended also to his son — who as he resided in one of the most seditious parts of this Neighbourhood has requested to have his Family removed to a Place of greater Safety— which has been promised on our part and will be carried into Effect during his absence at the Assizes.' He adds that they have requested the solicitors for the prosecution to make as little use of Stones as possible, and that it is hoped the Government will think him deserving of some remuneration, even if the fact of his giving open testimony makes him useless for the future.

The prosecutions before the Lancashire Special Commission 4 can be divided into four main categories: (1) those for the food riots at Manchester, (2) those for arson at Middleton, (3) those for arson at West Houghton, (4) those for illegal oaths. In addition there were some minor charges for various riots and one for arson at Bolton.5 For the first category, the food riots at Manchester, eight persons were tried, six men, two women : four were acquitted and four were found guilty and received the death sentence. Of the four condemned, three — John Howarth, John Lee, and Thomas Hoyle —

 were found guilty of riotously assembling at John Holland's house in Deansgate, breaking his door and windows open, and stealing bread, cheese, and potatoes. The fourth, Hannah Smith, a woman of fifty-four, had played a violent part in the riots.1 When the mob had seized ten bushels of potatoes and decreed to sell them at 8d. a score, Hannah Smith was heard to say, ' damn them we will have them for nothing,' and she afterwards helped to shovel them out, filling her own apron. She had also headed another mob and forced George Lomas to sell his potatoes at a loss, and here too her language was violent ; ' we will not be satisfied with Potatoes,' she cried, and 4 she threatened to stop Butter Carts and horses bringing Milk to Town, she would have Butter at Is. per Ib. and Milk at 2d. per Quart and if the Owners would not take that price she would have both Butter and Milk for nothing.' She carried out her threat about the butter, and the charge for which she was tried first and condemned to death was for jumping on a butter cart at Ardwick and selling twenty pounds of butter, worth 36s., at Is. the pound.

 The rioters at Burton's at Middleton, charged with arson, had a more fortunate fate than the Manchester rioters. Six men were tried for setting fire to Burton's house. There was no evidence to prove that they were concerned in the actual arson, but it was pretty clear that they had been in the mob, and Mr. Justice Le Blanc charged the jury, that even if the prisoners were not guilty of actually setting fire to the house, yet, if they were guilty of a riot alone, they were guilty of the whole charge.2 What happened is best told in the words of the prosecuting counsel, Mr. J. A. Park, Attorney- General for the County Palatine, in his description of the proceedings to the Home Office : 3 ' There were six others acquitted of the clearest case of Arson, to the utter dissatisfaction of the whole Court, Mr. Ewart, a Merchant of Liverpool, the foreman of the Jury, and the sole cause of the Mischief, having kept the Jury out an hour, before he could bring them over to his opinion. But I immediately to the great satisfaction of the Sheriff and Grand Jury, presented a fresh Bill against them for the Misdemeanour of rioting, etc., and would have proceeded instantly to try and openly said so. But when brought up they chose to traverse — however the Judges

3 H.O., 42, 124, June 2.

 equired two sureties for every Prisoner in £100 each, which bail they probably will not obtain, so that there has not been the triumph expected 1 — and Mr. Ewart was so looked down upon, that he never was seen in Court or at Lancaster afterwards.' It does not occur to Mr. Park that Mr. Ewart, having saved six persons from the hangman, might shake the dust of the Lancaster Special Commission off his feet for other reasons.

 For arson in the successful attack on the West Houghton factory, thirteen prisoners were tried — nine were men, two were boys of fifteen and sixteen, two were girls of fifteen and nineteen. It was not necessary to bring forward the evidence of any ' confidants,' as the prisoners could be identified by persons from the mill. Outside the Brief are scribbled some notes that show the lines of the prosecution : 2 ' Lowness of wages — and dearness of provisions — the ground for the objection — Will of Providence — Is the [word illegible] mended by destroying property — one hundred people thrown out of employment. The Means of Charity destroyed — Never was so charitable a country. The Poor shall never cease out of the land- — The poor ye shall have always with you,' etc. It is satisfactory to learn from the Minutes of the trial that the prosecuting counsel, Mr. Park, after pointing out that ' provisions being scarce was the dispensation of God,' alluded to the girl and boy prisoners ' with feeling,' but added 4 neither the tender sex of the one or the youth of the other could excuse them.' The evidence for the defence consisted of rather weak alibis or of testimony to character. The jury deliberated for an hour, and found only four out of the thirteen prisoners guilty. They seem to have made a selection of those whom they thought most deserved hanging. Clearly the ' tender sex ' of the two girls, Mary and Lydia Molyneux, saved them from death, for they had played an active part ' with Muck Hooks and Coal Picks in their Hands breaking the Windows of the Building and swearing and cursing the souls of those that worked in the Factory,' 3 while John Brownlow, the boy of fifteen, was saved by his mother, whom two witnesses described as having pulled him away against his will. The four who

 were found guilty were condemned to death. Their names were Job Fletcher, Thomas Kerfoot, James Smith, and Abraham Charlson, aged sixteen. Abraham Charlson, who had three soldier brothers, had played the soldier to his own undoing. He had acted as sentinel, pacing up and down with a scythe, and calling out encouraging remarks.

  For the fourth category of offences, namely, administering, receiving, or being present at the administration of illegal oaths, fifteen men and boys were sentenced to seven years' transportation. The question of the Luddite oath is discussed elsewhere ; 1 it is enough to mention here that six of these men 2 were sentenced on the evidence of Holland Bowden, who could not identify the prisoners, and of nine spies, for the oath to Sergeant Holland Bowden on the famous Dean Moor evening, April 19. 3 The rest 4 were sentenced in connection with the administration of oaths to Isaac Crompton and others at Bolton Moor, mainly on the evidence of Isaac Crompton himself, who purchased immunity by disclosing what had passed. In the notes for the case 6 the sinister fact is mentioned that the only corroborative evidence comes from John Stones.

 Two more men were sentenced to seven years' transportation for breaking into a mill at Worsley, and stealing grain and flour, and six women and girls and one man received the light punishment of six months' imprisonment for rioting at Middleton or elsewhere. The result of the trials was briefly
