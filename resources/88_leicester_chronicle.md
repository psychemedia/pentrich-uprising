Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 10 January 1818

Benjamin Scholes, the publican at Wakefield, whose evidence before the Magisrates at that place, was instrumental in exposing the artifices of *Oliver* and causing a number of poor mea who had been apprehended near Leeds to be set at liberty, passed through this town the beginning of the week, on his return home, after having been confined upwards of six months in Cambridge Castle, by order of Lord Sidmouth. We understand that the whole of the State Prisoners, committed since the suspension the Habeas Corpus Act, have been liberated from confinement upon their own recognizances, with the exception of the Messrs. Evans (father and son), and Benbow, who insist on being brought to trial, or discharged *unconditionally*. Mr. Knight, of Manchester, arrived in that place, on Friday last, from Reading Gaol.

TO DO

Our exertions to trace the connxion between the Agents of the worthless Ministry that is suffered to rule with arbitrary sway over the nation, and the circumstances that took place Derbyshire in June last, we have reason to believe, have had a considerable effect in leading the public mind to a correct opinion respecting the real causes of what have been termed the "legal murders" which have stained the annals of the country during the past year. The evidence of Bradley himself, who, it will be recollected, was the co-adjutor with *Oliver* in the Spy System; with the corroborative facts lately published in our paper, form a body of evidence to which reasonable man can refute his assent, and completely establish the conclusion so discreditable to the Government, that not a vestage of Treason would have existed in the country, but for the agency of their own Spies.
 In addition these the evidence of Benjamin Scholes, who wa* a few days ago liberated from the dungcott.in which wa* confined *tx month* for otfier crime but that discovering Oliver's plot againat the People, confirms the fact of the connexion.— This person, who then kept public housu at Wakefield, which Oliver frequented, ready to state upon oath, if required, that Bacon met Oliver at his home teveral times previous lb the Pentridge riot.* The real truth then appears to be, that Treason was wauled in certain quarter to cover designs far more treasonable against the liberties Britain; and if could not already found amongst a People almost urged to despair the dreadful effect?? the misconduct of their rulers, t*u*l brought into existence by *el wretches hired for the thi* we owe the bloody spectacle exhibited the very day after the nation bad been bereaved of an illustrious Princess which, notwithstanding the sneers of the Editor of the Journal, and though the sacrifice Wat performed with all imaginable solemnity, the farce was predominant over the tragedy, and a nation blushed the execution of what was already called national justice!” We again call upon the Editor to disprove our statements if can. let him he asaured the public ill not rest satisfied with impudent cavils, of wilful slanders, respecting a pretended difference between the Prisoners' Counsel and Attorneys, or a misapplication of money said be collected, while evidence rebut the main fact of the plot originating with Oliver cannot produced. But to shew the Public what credit it be attached to the confident assertions the Journalist even minor Joints, we below specimen of the numerous falsehoods lie has foisted upon his readers. and lint* consign him and his coadjutors the Observer, and Intelligencer, that merited indignity, which their attempts to delude the public justly deserve! * Some of our readers may probably enquire what became of the Leicestershire treason, which made so considerable figure in the first Green Bag. assure that some the hortmimble fraternity endeavoured patch plot in this neighbourhood. A respectable Tradesman Leicester received an anonymous letter, telling him to prepare his gunpowder and shot, as it would be wanted in few days. This letter was very properly given up the Magistrates, and the receiver thus escaped the snare which was laid for him. Can any person inform us, if the writing was compared with that of Oliver, or whether any means were made use of tu find out the unthnr } ♦ It may remarked here, what high ideas nf morality one nor county Members must have, who took upon himself eulogize Oliver the Spy as a moral man &v.— hope wad trust that at the next election the Freeholders of Leicestershire will inform that gentleman that they are determined not to bwgooir Use disciples of tisa Professor of new moral Philosophy Mr Stoughton Grange College 1 
 
 STATE TRIALS AT DERBY. To the EDITOR - LEICESTER CHRONICLE It that the Editor of the Leiceeter Journal was not the Author of the tiring of falsehoods which have appeared in his paper relative to the State trials at Derby, but that copied them from the Leeds Intelligencer and then adopted them as Ml own.

TO DO

HOUSE OF COMMONS. { ffedneiday, Feb. ID PROCEEDINGS RESPECTING SPIES, &C. Vr. Fazakerley dueled, Ih&t in the Report of the Secret Committee of b«t fetaion, it was stated, that the langaage and conduct of certain penuni, who had keen employed to watch the moTemenls of the disaffected, might have contributed to encourage the practices which was the object of Government to suppress. He wished therefore to ask, whether any steps had been been taken to bring the persons alluded to to justice?—(Hear, hear!) During the Suspension Laws, the jails were crowded the victims of these Spies and Informers, and itinerant Stale Prisoners were paraded about the country. exhibiting a* strange a miaUire of strong and weak measures as had ever distinguished any Administration,—<(hear, hear!)—Mutlitnde* had been taken and then dismissed without trial, and cauie whatever appeared for such conduct. Inquiry was therefore in every way necessary. The Hon. Member concluded moving, That instructions be given the Secret Committee, examine and report, whether any and what measures had been taken detect and bring to justice alt any of those persons who had been described in the Secret Report of June 1817. a* Having been in manner the eaavo of the disturbances which look place lust year,” Mr. C. Bathurst said. Ihe Hon. Gentleman wa* mistaken in imagining Hut the Report had designated the Spies as Ihe cause the disaffection« the Report said no such thing, though it admitted that Ihe conduct of certain individuals sent to procure information, was calculated to encourage disaffection. Those persons were not the authors of the disturbances which had taken place, though they must of course have seemed to encourage the disaffection it was meant put down. Before Oliver went among them, meetings had been held. When persons were detected in their guilt, it was common fur them to turn round and accuse of guilt those who had delected them—(Hear l>—ld fact, not one individual had been arrested on the iuformation of Oliver, nor was it on his evidence that the Habeas Corpus Act had been suspended (Hear, hear !) —Under all the circumstances, he saw no reason why Government should be called upon to-proceed against persons who had only procured proper information, and be should oppose the motion. Lord Millon observed, that if ever should become a Spy, he would not wish a better master than the Right Hon. Gentleman—(Laughter)—for he should be sure of being defended him any thing be should do. The House, however, would not ill duly nnleu it entered on a diligent inquiry, It was too much to hear the conduct of Spies treated with so little esteem in that House(Hear, hear!)—instead of viewing with proper indignation. Mr. C, Grant, jun. argued that it was the duty of Government to art the information of agents t and as no extraordinary ground had been shown for interference, he should oppose the motion. Mr. Bennett said, that if a case could be made out, the country would he satisfied that this was one of the grossest juggle* that any Ministers had ventured to impose the people. He did not wish to give any general opinion on the employment Spies < but he knew that they were edgetools which were very dangerous to be handled.— Some wretched individuals at Manchester and other places had been induced to accept the sanguinary employment of spies a small addition to their weakly eafniogt. held in bis hand pamphlet published by Capt. Raines, of the Militia, in which the author stated Ihql he bad procured persons to join Luddites, and take a horrid oath, for the purpose of breaking it and betraying other* who took it. The Right Hun. Gentleman had given a sort of challenge respecting the character of the persons lately employed, which he would meet. To begin with Castles—he was a bully, an ulterer of forged notes, and had been Spy before under the Transport Office. Another, Oliver, had began his career by being guilty of bigamy, and the rest of bit character was equally bad: he owed to the mercy of benefactor, he had basely injured, the infamous life which be now held. On the 84lh of April, Oliver set out for Liverpool.— He afterwards went to Leeds Manchester, where he called on mutt respectable persons.— Wherever he went he insisted on the absolute necessity of physical force, and the uselessness of petitioning. Atone meeting on the 6th of May. when there were ten delegates present, Oliver had desired person to write down and sign a list of (he number of those who would Join, which he (Mr. Bennett) firmly believed was the origin of (he assertion in the Report of the Secret Committee, that lists of men and arms had been prepared « and he believed that Oliver had been at Derby. The 

Hon. Gentleman then read an affidavit, which gave an account of Oliver's proceedings Derby, his having attended a meeting there, where he said, that ail the rest of the country was ready to rise, and that 60,000 proclamations had been printed by Mr. Wooler. &c. It further stated, that h»(Oliver)., saw Braridreth on the I6lh. He read a pari of Braodrclh’asiwn statement, made to his Solicitor in confidence, which confessed the acts lh had been accused of but had been instigated: it mentioned his meeting with Oliver, who repeated the same story that he had every where told.— Oliver then went to Nottingham and Birmingham with the same mischievous intent. One very material fad was, that tranquillity was restored the very day that Oliver ceased his employ meal Great distress had existed, of which some factious men had taken advantage, but their designs could have inspired fear, had not Oliver been preseut to stimulate and direct them.—U bad keen said, that if Oliver had instigated the men at Derby, he might have been called at evidence; he was certainly on the spot, ready to purchase the bloodmoney of Brandreth; but to ?are called him would have proved the very guilt which they denied. This argument was a disgrace—(Load cries of hear, hear!) disgrace to the justice of the country. He was prepared prove the truth of hit assertions oaths and credible-witnesses(Hear, heart) —most credible witnesses; and - he challenged the Hon. and Learned Gentleman to show they were not—(Hear, hear!) —The Noble Lord might erv hear, heart and deny Ihe motion in that House ; but that would not do with the country before which they stood, and verdict would be such the enormity of the case deserved I Mr. fFUbe/forte objected to the motion, it was founded on a false assumption. He did not mean to say that nothing of the disturbance was to attributed to Oliver; but what had just been stated came also from a doubtful source; and he should like to hear what Oliver would say to the charges against him.—(Hear, hear!) —If they were true, it would be service to the public bring him to justice. With respect to the employment of Spies, it was certainly not allowable in religious view. The God of Truth abhorred falsehood and deceit; and evan in a politicalpoTut, though their employment might at tiroes produce temporary advantages, yet, when he considered alt the distrust which such system roust occasion—when he considered the temptations to false information of every description—the suspicions and disaffection that most be excited against the Government itself, and the general confusion such system would excite—he was opinion that their employment false policy.—[Hear, hear !] —He for one condemned the practice; the country and the Government would lose more than thev gained them. But, notwithstanding all that had been said by the disaffected, and notwithstanding all Ihe real sufferings of the people in season of distress, this country enjoyed a greater share of liberty, than had been ever possessed in any age or by any other nation—there never was a more prosperous, a moral, happier nation! Still, the use of soch agents, Ihe people would have (heir principles perverted and their sympathies turned in favour of their worst enemies. No; the British nation did not stand in need of the assistance of such base associates—(Loud cries of hear!)—He most say, however, he was against the motion itself, (Hear, and laughter) because it involved an inquiry which could not be carried on in the Committee. The Solicitor General denied that the postage in the Report would bear the cooitructinn now pot upon it; it in fuel imputed nothing that could be the foundation of a criminal indictment. The Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Beonet) had not given the names of the periontfrom whom he derived bit information! but he had mentioned the name of Mitchell, and this was a clue to the rest. That person had been charged with treason, and was therefore to thought proper witness depreciate the characters of those who had been employed to detect his designs Then there was Pendril and Stephen, who had fled to America, and they might have furnished the information. Did a charge of treason increase the credibility of the persons so charged [Hear!] He knew that, now days, persons who had been brought hefore Court of Justice were deemed proper objects the bounty and patronage of the public. raising a cry against Oliver and the Spies, they thought they could shift from themlelves load of criminality, and impute the whole Government conspiracy—(Hear, hcarl) Oliver, forsooth, had done all the mischief! The Hon. Gentleman had said, that Oliver was ready to be produced at Derby sell the blood the prisoners: but he could not have been produced as a witness, fur he was not on the list furnished to the prisoners. He allowed, tlial had Oliver been called the prisoners, his testimony must have gone convict them: but if they could have proved that they had been deluded him iuto crime, it would have operated their favour when (hey were called for judgment. Nothing had been proved which tended shew that Oliver had arranged Ibe conspiracy. He had now shown that the motion was unnecessary, it was founded a mistake of the meaning of the Report- Sir S. Romilly remarked, that after the charges brought by his Hon. Friend, which he had substantiate on oath, he thought the House should uot date to resist inquiry into Ibe truth. But the Learned Gentleman suspected that the information Came from what he termed a polluted source.— Mitchell, had been arrested, —no mailer what evidence,—had heen imprisoned,and therefore his evidence was inadmissible! Thus a new expedient had been discovered by one the first Law Officers of the Crown, for disqualifying evidence that might be brought against Ministers. According to this new plan. Government bad only to throw an obnoxious individual into prison, and then his testimony would become incredible I(Hear, hear !) —The moment be was taken up, he would lotb both his liberty and his character I

THE LEEDS PLOT.

*(From the Leeds Mercury.)*

While the country was smoothing itself with the hope that the conspiracies against the State, of which they had heard so much, and seen so little. were all at an end; and while even the Argus-eyed vigilance of his Majesty's Ministers slept; a most awful discovery of a plot in which two thousand conspirators are engaged has been made in Leeds! It seems "that one hundred petitions, signed by twenty persons each praying for Reform, were presented ot the House of Commons, in the beginning of this month, from the town of Leeds;" and so profound was the secrecy with which these Petitions were got up, that the Printer of the *Leeds Intelligencer*, whose sagacity is almost equal to his moderation, "has not been able to learn that any one person, except the alleged Petitioners themselves, knew these Petitions were in Progress in the town, or had heard of them until they were presented to the House." The conspiring mind implied in the obtaining of these two thousand signatures, without the knowledge of a soul but the alleged Petitioners, is announced as one of the most alarming facts that has occurred in the whole progress of the existing disaffection— and the persons engaged in the plot, are denounced as "a band of close conspiring villains." To add to the horrors of this discovery, the Printer of the *Intelligencer* has heard, but he does not know how truly, that delegates have lately been sent from Huddersfield to London, for the purpose of renewing the machinations of last year; and, in conclusion, it is intimated, that it is necessary again to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, to prevent the congregating of another "concourse of these scoundrels in the Metropolis." The *Courier*, who is a fellow labourer in the vocation of alarm creating, has copied part of the *Intelligencer's news*; but the terms villains and scoundrels were too gross even for the columns of that Paper, and the Editor has very properly omitted such outrageous epithets.

We believe that there are very few persons upon whom this political hoax is calculated to impose, but it may notwithstanding, be necessary in order to calm the tremulous nerves of those who are prone to be alarmed by phantoms, to say, that so far from any secresy prevailing on the subject of the Petitions a letter from Major Cartwright, recommending petitioning by twenties, was inserted in is this paper before the petitions were set on foot— that many of the signatures were obtained upon a table, placed for successive market-days near the Market Cross *(within about lieo hundred yards of the Leeds Intelligencer Office)* —and that, so far from a knowledge of the Petitions being confined to two thousand persons though that is a pretty round number, ten thousand of the inhabitants at least were in the secret. The history of the transaction we find on enquiry, to be this:— a numbe of men, principally, if not altogether in the labouring classes, thinking it proper to renew their Petitions for Annual Parliaments and Universal Suffrage, handed about each a sheet of paper, with a short form of Petition inscribed upon the head of it; and we believe there are very few workshops or manufactories in the town, in which the petitions were not openly displayed as they were upon the tables in the open the public market.
