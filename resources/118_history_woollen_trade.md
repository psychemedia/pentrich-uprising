Notwithstanding the extensive improvement introduced in manufactures, it was extremely difficult to bring them into operation, from the fears and excitement which prevailed amongst the labouring classes; for a system was pursued in Nottinghamshire, in the years 1810 and 1811, to destroy frames used in the manufacture of lace; and the spirit which there had its rise, extended to the larger manufacturing districts, and the destruction of all machinery, which, as they thought, interfered with hand labour, was contemplated.

Riots commenced in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the year 1812, the chief object being the destruction of gig mills used for raising the wool on blankets, coatings, baize, and on cloth in the process of finishing. The men were regularly organised and trained. After demolishing the works of Mr. Foster, of Horbury, in Yorkshire, their leader ordered them into a field, and their numbers (each man having a number to conceal his name) being called over, he dismissed them by the word of command, — "the work is done, disperse!" The time occupied in the business of mustering, destruction, and dispersing did not exceed twenty minutes. They had the appellation of Luddites. Detachments were sent round the country, who searched the houses for arms, and their depredations were not checked, till a most respectable manufacturer at Huddersfield, Mr. Horsfall, was shot near his own house. A reward of £2,000 was offered for the detection of the murderers, one of whom turned king's evidence, and three were tried and convicted by a special commission, in January, 1813, and were executed at York; and fourteen, who were severally convicted of participating in an attack on Mr. Cartwright'a mill, and other mills, were all executed on one day; and however revolting the destruction of so many lives is to the feelings, it was considered absolutely necessary in order to stop the ravages which were daily committed. It put an end to those disorders, and at the assizes which took place at York, in the April following, Mr. Parke, king's counsel, publicly declared, that however sanguinary it had appeared, in the execution of so many deluded wretches, leaving twelve widows and fifty-seven orphan children, Luddism was then extinct, and government declined to prosecute the other prisoners, having been only determined to restore tranquillity and good order.

Though the exertions made by public men, and by the leading agriculturists of the kingdom, to introduce the spanish merino sheep had been so great, they found it impossible to produce that quality of wool which was required by the manufacturers of superfine cloth; and when they brought their wool to market, meeting the competition of spanish wool, and of saxony wool, the fineness of which now became known, they were greatly disappointed at the prices they were able to obtain, attributing them to what they considered the prejudices of the manufacturers, and they pressed upon Government their grand specific for all distresses, taxation on foreign wool, as their only protection against the evils of which they complained. The agriculturists of England were, however, divided into two parties, — those whose possessions were on the light soils, the downs and the heaths, with fine herbage, and those whose property consisted of rich, loamy, clay, and fen lands. The former were disappointed in the improvement they anticipated in their fleeces from the introduction of the merino sheep; and at their head were Lord somerville, the Earl of sheffield, sir John sinclair, Mr. Western, Mr. Burrell, Mr. Holme sumner, &c. &c.; while those who encouraged the

*Woollen Manufacture, Process of.* In an early part of this work, under the article CLOTH, we have given a general view of the process of cloth-making, furnished by a principal manufacturer in the west of England. In the present article, we shall confine our account chiefly to those improvements in the processes which have since been introduced, and shall add a description of the machines which were only slightly noticed in the article *Cloth*, and give references to the plates. The processes of the woollen manufacture may be classed under two heads; those by which wool is prepared for the weaver, and those by which the cloth is finished after it is taken out of the loom. The sorting of wool has already been referred to under the article *Wool*. English wool is supposed to be sufficiently cleaned from pitch marks or other extraneous substances by the wool-sorter, and left by him in a proper state to commence the process of cloth-making. spanish wool in the bale has generally some part of the pitch employed to mark the sheep still adhering to it, which must be carefully cut off. It was till recently the practice to beat the wool with rods, in order to shake out the dust and open the staples; but this is now principally done by an opening machine with long coarse teeth, called a devil, or wool-mill. spanish wool is frequently so hardly pressed together in the bag, that it requires to be opened out by beating, to prepare it for the further processes.

In the west of England, wool is generally scoured before it is dyed or carded; but in Yorkshire this is seldom practised on wool intended for white cloths, and among the smaller, manufacturers who dye their own wool, it is frequently put into the dyeing-vat unscoured; a practice which injures the brightness of the colours, but which enables the manufacturer to make a greater weight of cloth with the same quantity of wool. There is also some saving of labour and expence; but this is more than counter-balanced by the increased quantity of oil per pack required for unscoured wool, which is at least one-third more than would be necessary if the wool were scoured. In the west of England, where the wool is scoured previously to its manufacture, the process is carried on with a degree of neatness and cleanliness, which form a perfect contrast with the horrid stench and disgusting filthiness of the woollen factories in Yorkshire. For fine cloths, olive-oil, called Gallipoli, from the part where it was supposed to be sent, is principally used; and for the coarser cloths rape-oil. Where attention to colour is not required in very coarse goode, fish-oil is sometimes employed; but if the latter remain in the wool or cloth, it turns it brown, undergoing a degree of fermentation injurious to the cloth, and which sometimes occasions spontaneous combustion. To lessen the expence of oil for coarse cloths, some manufacturers in Yorkshire make use of a mixture of soap and water with oil, which answers very well in moist weather, if the wool be immediately carded and spun; but if it remain some time unwashed, or the weather be very hot, the mixture evaporates. It has been attempted to work wool without any oil whatever, but without success. The use of oil is to cover the surface of the fibres, and enable them to slide easily over each other in carding or spinning. What we have before said of the structure of the surface of wool or hair, under the article *Wool*, will suffice to shew the advantage that must result from oiling. The wool is sprinkled with oil as evenly as possible. In Yorkshire the proportion on fine wool is about six gallons per pack, and this is more equally distributed over it by the wool-mill, through which it passes previous to the process called scribbling. This process is a kind of coarse carding, and is performed on a machine similar to that used for scribbling cotton, but larger, and with coarser cards, the principle being similar to that of the carding-machine, hereafter to be described. By this engine the longer fibres are broken down, and they are all laid straight and nearly parallel to each other. The wool leaves the roller of the scribbling-mill in one thin undivided sheet, and the more clear, even, and transparent it appears when held between the eye and the light, the more perfectly has the operation been performed. On the carding-engine, the operation is repeated on finer cards; but instead of leaving the machine in one continued sheet, it is finally divided into separate portions, which by a fluted roller are formed into separate round pieces about one inch in diameter, and two feet three inches in length. The fibres are now arranged so as more easily to slide over and twist round each other in the next process, which is a kind of coarse spinning called slubbing, performed with the slubbing-machine, which will be described. On this machine each of the rolls from the carding-machine are joined together, and drawn out into a loosely-twisted thread, and wound round a spindle, forming what is technically called a *slubbing*. These slubbings being taken to the spinning jenny, which will also be described, are twisted in an opposite direction, and drawn out into threads of yarn of the requisite length. For very fine yarn used in shawls, a machine called the mule is sometimes employed, nearly similar to the cotton mule (see *Manufacture of Cotton*), the slubbing passing through rollers which assist in drawing out the thread smaller and more regular. The yarn is now prepared for winding, sizing, warping, and weaving. (see *Cloth*.) since the article *CLOTH* was written, broad-cloth is almost universally woven by one person only in a loom, making use of the fly-shuttle. (see *Weaving*.) The next process is scouring and burling, already described under the articles *CLOTH* and *Fulling*. The cloth is then sent to the fulling-mill; the finer kinds are prepared for fulling by a mixture of soap and water; in sparse kinds, fuller's-earth supplies the place of soap. (see *Fulling-Mill*, and a farther description at the end of the article.) The principle on which the felting depends has been described under the article *Wool*. By the process of fulling, the cloth becomes shortened in length and breadth, and the fibres are incorporated and intimately united with each other. In the best manufactured cloths, this incorporation is so complete, that the separate threads can scarcely be distinguished, the bottom of the cloth appearing to form one even continuous substance. An improvement in this respect has recently been made at Leeds, by spinning the wool much softer and thicker than has usually been the practice, and uniting the threads in the fulling-mill, and then working the substance of the cloth down to a requisite degree of thinness by the gig-mill, hereafter to be described. At the end of the process, the face or surface of the cloth is much softer, and greatly superior in appearance to cloth manufactured in the common process. A pack of wool of 240 lbs. will make when milled about one hundred and twenty yards of mixed or coloured cloth from fifty to sixty inches in breadth, according to the quality and fineness of the wool. The process of raising, shearing, and pressing, have been mentioned under the article *Cloth*, and will be more fully described when an account is given of the gig-mill and shearing-machine. The object of these processes is to cover the thread with a soft pile, consisting of the fibres of the wool, cut down to an even surface over the whole piece.

There are various kinds of woollen goods worked on the same principle as cloth, and made with both the warp and the weft of carded wool, but which being unmilled, or finished in a different manner, receive different names.

....

From the most remote period of the woollen manufacture until the latter end of the last century, or about the year 1780, very few, if any, mechanical improvements had been introduced into it. During the whole time the various processes were carried on nearly in the same manner, but with greater or less skill, and were employed upon materials more or less valuable. The carding and spinning of wool, and the weaving and finishing of cloth, in the early part of the reign of George III,, were effected by the same machines as in the time of Edward III., which probably were similar to those of the ancient Romans, but more rude in their construction. In an art which had seen so many centuries roll on without any change, it did not appear possible to the manufacturer that any improvement could be effected; and had not the genius of Hargreaves and Arkwright changed entirely the modes of carding and spinning cotton, the woollen manufacture would probably have remained at this day what it was in the earliest ages of civilized society. That it would have been better for general society if it had so remained we readily admit; but after the improved modes of working cotton were discovered, this was impossible. The spinning jenny, which was the same as that employed in the cotton manufacture, but somewhat larger, was introduced into Yorkshire from Lancashire about the year 1780, but did not become general till about three years afterwards. In the first jennies, not more than eighteen or twenty threads could be spun, and the mode of winding the thread upon the spindle was very imperfect. The carding was still effected by the hand, and the slubbing or roving was prepared on the common spinning-wheel. For some time considerable difficulty was experienced in carding by machinery, particularly in clearing the wool from the card; and a slight change in the construction of the machine was found necessary to prepare the wool for the slubbing-billy, of which an account will be given in the description of the carding-machine. soon after this, the carding and spinning of wool and yarn by machinery became general through the manufacturing districts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and large mills were erected, in which the carding and scribbling machines were turned by a water-wheel, and the roving or slubbing performed on the billy. The wool carded at these mills was sent to the smaller manufacturers in the state of slubbing, and the farther process of spinning was effected on jennies in their own premises. Before the year 1787, the old processes of carding by the hand, and spinning on the wheel, were entirely discontinued in Yorkshire; but it was some years after before the new processes were generally introduced in the west of England, and thus, as we have before stated, the woollen trade became more concentrated in Yorkshire, where cloths could be manufactured at less expence. About this time, machinery began to be applied to the combing and spinning of long combing-wool, to make worsted yarn. see *Worsted spinning*.

In consequence of the great increase of trade in Yorkshire, it was found difficult to obtain situations for mills to be turned by water, and the application of the steam-engine to woollen machinery became very general. The abundance of fuel was highly advantageous to the Yorkshire manufacturer; and it was found to be equally cheap to work the machines by steam as by water, where any considerable rent was paid for the water. The motion of the improved steam-engine was also rendered as regular as a water-wheel, and the great inconvenience and loss from the interruption of the works by frosts or continued droughts were thereby avoided.

The smaller manufacturers in Yorkshire were at first benefited by the introduction of machinery, but in a little time large capitalists began to engage in the woollen trade, and performing all the processes with their own machinery, they were enabled to work cheaper and undersell the smaller makers. The facility also with which wool could now be worked up kept the markets always well stocked with goods, and prevented the manufacturers from taking the advantage of a temporary scarcity or a brisk demand, which they had formerly done, an overstocked market always reducing the profits. soon after the year 1800, the number of small manufacturers began rapidly to decrease many of them, being ruined by the change which had taken place, and compelled to become workmen in the factories of the large capitalists.

The gig-mill and the shearing-machine were not introduced into Yorkshire until they had been several years employed in the west of England, owing to the resistance made to them by the working cloth-dressers or croppers in the north.

The manufacture of worsted is properly a branch of the woollen manufacture, and noticed as such in our history of its progress in England; yet the mode of manufacture, both in preparing the worsted yarn and finishing the goods, being

...

*Description of the Machines employed in the Woollen Manufacture.*—The wool-mill, or willy, is the first machine which is employed on the raw wool to open and disentangle the close matting, in which the wool comes from the wool-stapler. It is also used for clearing the dyed wool from the dye stuff, and again for mixing different parcels of wool together; also for incorporating the oil with the wool.

The wool-mill used in Yorkshire consists of a cylindrical drum, about three feet long and two feet and a half diameter, which is made to revolve near three hundred times per minute. Its circumference is furnished with teeth or spikes, and immediately above it five small rollers are placed, which are also furnished with similar teeth.

...

*scribbling-Machine.*—This is the first stage of carding. The operation tends to disentangle the fibres which were before closely entangled, and draw them out separately, so as to render the wool light and flaky. The scribbling-machine is very similar to the carding-machine, having a large cylinder or drum, which is covered on the surface with sheets of leather stuck full of projecting wire-teeth, called card-wires. The teeth are so close together as to cover the whole surface of the cylinder, like the bristles of a brush. This cylinder is turned rapidly round by the machinery, and the wool is regularly and slowly supplied by feeding machinery to its teeth, which take it up, and the cylinder, as it were, clothes itself with wool.

...

*slubbing-Machine, or Billy.*—This performs the first process of spinning. It reduces the cardings, and draws them out in length; joins them together, and gives them a slight twist, in order to form a coarse and loose thread, called a slubbing or roving, which must be spun over again in the jenny, to make a thread fine enough for the loom.

This operation was formerly performed by hand on the common hand spinning-wheel, which is similar to that used for spinning wool, but of a smaller size. Machines were then contrived by which a number of slubbings could be drawn out together; but the aid of the hands was required for joining the rolls or cardings of wool together in succession, and for other purposes, which were found to take so much time, that very little, if any, saving of labour was effected by the use of such machines.

...

*spinning Jenny.*—In this machine, the slubbings are spun over again, and reduced to the requisite fineness for weaving. The jenny has nearly the same parts as the billy, but differently arranged. The spindles are placed at one end of the frame, and the clasp which holds the slubbings is placed on the carriage, so that it can be moved backwards and forwards, to and from the spindles by the spinner, in order to draw out and extend the yarn at the same time it is twisted.

...

The *Mule for spinning of Yarn* is very nearly the same machine as the mule for spinning cotton; this is used for spinning some kinds of woollen yarn instead of the jenny. When the mule is employed for spinning yarn for weft, it is used in the same manner as described in our article *Cotton Manufacture*; but for spinning warp, the spindles are made to revolve, and twist the thread some time after the carriage is run completely out, and the stretching of the yarn is finished. There is a movement in the machine that shifts the endless strap which turns the mule upon a larger pulley, as soon as the carriage is run fully out, so as to give a more rapid motion to the spindles after the stretching, or drawing out, is finished, than they had during the drawing back of the carriage. By this means some time is saved, because the spindles may be allowed to run very quick when it is only required to twist the threads; but whilst the extension is going on, the twisting motion must be moderate, or the threads would be broken. A very similar movement is used in the mule for spinning cotton, and is called the double-speed; but the description of this mechanism is omitted in the article *MANUFACTURE*.

The mule has not, till lately, been in much repute for spinning woollen yarn, and the jenny is still thought to spin better yarn; but we have no doubt that when certain modifications are made, it will become a much more perfect method than the jenny, being much less dependent on the discretion and dexterity of the spinner; for if the machine is once constructed so as to spin properly, it will always continue to do so.

...

*Burling.*—The cloth being dried is burled, that is examined minutely in every part, and all knots and uneven threads or straws, or extraneous matters, removed; any rents or defects which can be found are repaired, by introducing fresh threads. This being done before the milling or felting, the fibres of the new threads will become so entangled - . render such defects nearly imperceptible in the finished cloth.

*scouring*.—The piece of cloth must be cleansed from the greasiness of the oil before it can be felted; for this purpose, it is first soaked three hours in a mixture of urine and pig’s dung, it is then scoured in the mill for two hours, and lastly, for half an hour with fair water. The scouring is performed at the fulling-mill by a pair of stocks.

*Fulling-Mill for felting the Cloth.*—There is another kind of stocks in a fulling-mill; but the shape of the trough in which the stocks or hammers work on the cloth is different from that described in the article Fulling-Mill, which is only proper for scouring. In order to subject the cloth to the blows of the hammers, the trough for milling ts formed in such a manner that the cloth cannot escape from them, because that part of the trough which is opposed to the beaks of the hammers is nearly a flat surface, and perpendicular to the direction in which the hammers strike, so that the cloth is actually beaten between the beaks of the hammers and the flat bottom or rather fide of the trough.

The hammers are made to strike very heavy blows; but they do not bruise or injure the cloth, because there is always a great number of folds of cloth on which they strike. The helves or handles of the hammers are placed in a different position from the scouring-stocks, in order to make the hammer-heads fall in a more perpendicular direction when they make their stroke, and hence they strike with more force. On this account they are called falling-stocks whilst those used for scouring are called hanging-stocks, in which the helves of the hammers being nearer to the perpendicular, the heads move in a more horizontal direction in the manner of a pendulum, and exert less force on the cloth; the other difference is, that the hammers of the scouring-stocks only drive the heap of cloth round in the trough there being no part directly opposed to the beaks of the hammers but a fair curve, which is so much inclined to the direction in which the hammers move, that the cloth mounts up the inclined curve when the hammer strikes, and evades the direct force of the blow.

...

*Tentering.*— When the milling is finished, the cloth is stretched again on the tenter. It is usual to extend the piece to forty-two yards in length, but not at all in breadth; indeed only one inch of extension in each yard is allowed by law. The cloth remains in the open air until it is perfectly dry and ready for the succeeding operations of finishing, which are only intended to give it a beautiful surface, for it already possesses all the useful qualities of cloth.

*Dressing the Cloth with Teasels.*—This operation is to raise up the nap or loose fibres on the surface of the cloth, by scratching it over with a species of thistles called teasels, in order to form a wool on the surface, which can be removed by shearing. The teasels are the balls or ears which contain the seed of the plant called *dipsacus fullonum*; the seales which form the ball project on all sides, and are terminated with sharp points, which turn downwards, like hooks, and are very elastic. see *TEAsEL*.

A number of teasels are put into a small frame, which is composed of a handle eight or ten inches long, having a small stick passed through it at one end about eight inches long, which is split into two at each end nearly all its length. There is also another similar stick, which is passed through the handle near the middle of its length; the two split sticks are perpendicular to the stem or handle, and parallel to each other. The space between them is filled with teasels, which are jambed in very fast between them, and also in the clefts of the split sticks, where they are secured by strings extended between the ends of the split sticks, and twisted, until they draw the sticks forcibly together, and bind the teasels very fast. This frame filled with teasels forms a stool, which very much resembles the curry-comb used to clean horses, and is used in a similar manner, to scratch over the whole surface of the cloth, and draw out all loose ends of the fibres of the wool, which are not firmly confined by the entanglement of the felting.

The dressing is performed by two men, who hold the teasel-frame by its handle, and work the cloth, when it is hung up in a vertical position over two rails fixed to the ceiling; when they have worked over as much surface as they can reach, they draw down a fresh portion, which they work in turn, and thus proceed until they have finished the whole piece. The first time the cloth is dressed it is wetted with water; it is worked three times over in the wet state, by strokes in the direction of the length of the piece, and then it is worked again three times in the other direction; by this means all the fibres are raised, and the cloth is prepared for shearing.

In the most improved manufactories, the dressing is performed by the gig or gig-mill. This is a cylinder covered on its surface with teasels; and turned rapidly round whilst the cloth is drawn over it.

The *Gig-mill* is represented in perspective in Plate V. *Woollen Manufacture.* ...

...

*shearing or Cropping the Cloth.*—By the operation of the teasels, the wool is become raised all over the surface of the cloth in a loose fur, which must be removed by shearing before the cloth will be fit for wearing, because the fur would gather dirt and dust, and would wear very unequally.

The shears used for cropping by hand are the same as those used in the common shearing-machine, and are represented at E, E, in Plate III. *Woollen Manufacture*. The clothier's shears consist of two very large flat blades of steel, united together by a stem of steel, which is bent into a circular bow, and is sufficiently flexible to allow one of the blades to be moved upon the other, in order to make them cut. Both blades are ground to sharp and straight edges, which apply one to the other, but the blades are not in parallel planes like scissars, for one of the blades is laid quite flat upon the cloth, and the plane of the other blade will then be inclined to the cloth at about an angle of 45 degrees, as is shewn in Plate III. The cutting-edge of this inclined blade bears upon the surface of the flat blade, and the spring of the bow is so set, as to press the two edges always in contact. The lines of the edges of the two blades are not parallel to each other, but inclined, so that the edge of the upper blade crosses the edge of the lower blade, and bears upon the flat surface of that blade, at the end nearest to the bow, whilst the other end of the edge of the upper blade is removed over the edge of the lower blade, thus leaving an interval between the two edges, when the shears are open, as is plainly shewn in the figure. In this state, the shears being open, if the lower blade is laid flat upon the surface of the cloth, the nap or wool, which is to be removed by the cropping, will stand up above the edge of the lower blade, in the interval between the two edges; then if the blades be forced together, the edge of the upper blade will pass or cross over that of the lower, and cut away all the wool which projects above the edge of the lower blade. The contact of the cutting-edges begins at the end nearest to the bow, and proceeds regularly to the other, because, as before mentioned, the edges are not parallel to each other. The blades open or return to their former position by the elasticity of the bow, but in order to make the cut they are closed by means of a handle or lever 10, which is fitted or lodged on a round part of the stem of the bow, so as to play thereupon as upon a centre of motion. A double cord is made fast to the lever or handle near to this centre, the other end of the cord is fastened to a block of wood, which is screwed to the flat of the lower blade, and rises up to a proper height. By depressing this handle, the shears are closed, and make their cut with the greatest facility, the elasticity of the bow returning the handle.

The manner of cropping with these shears is as follows:— The piece of cloth is laid down in folds upon a plank or low bench placed on the ground, and the end is drawn across a table or bench, which is covered with cloth, and stuffed with horse-hair, like a cushion. The cloth is stretched out flat upon the surface of the table, and is retained by hooks and weights. Two workmen are employed to shear a piece of cloth; they place the lower blades of their shears flat on the surface of the cloth, with the line of the edge in the direction of the length of the piece; one of the shears is laid on the edge or lift of the cloth, and the other exactly in the middle of the breadth of the cloth. The bows and stems of the shears project over the edge of the table, and. the workmen place themselves at that edge. Each man guides the shears with his left-hand, and makes the cut with his right. To hold the shears by, a short staff is lashed to the bow of the shears, and secured by a stay to the lower blade; its direction is nearly parallel to the back edge of the upper blade. The workman puts his arm through the bow as far as the elbow-joint, then lays the fore-arm flat against the staff, which he grasps with the hand; and in this way he has a great command of the shears, leaving the right-hand at liberty to work the handle which closes the shears. This handle is moved backwards and forwards with great rapidity, to make cuts or clips on the cloth, and between every cut the lower blade is moved a small space on the cloth, to cut in a fresh part.

The art of shearing consists in moving the shears with great regularity and parallelism, so that every part of the surface shall be equally cropped. The closeness with which the shears cut is regulated by weights laid upon the flat of the lower blade; these press the blade down into the soft cushion on which the cloth is spread, so that the fur will stand up more above the edge of the blade.

As the two shearers advance in their work, their shears proceed across the breadth of the piece of cloth, and when the man who began in the middle has worked to the list of the cloth, the other who began at the list will have worked to the middle, where the first began; the whole breadth is now shorn, and they remove the shears, and draw the piece of cloth forwards across the table, to obtain a fresh surface te work upon.

For shearing common cloth, it is cut wet the first time, then it is dressed again with teasels, dried on the tenter, and cut again in a dry state three times over.

*shearing-Frame.* —The most common machine used in Yorkshire is only applied to give motion to the same kind of shears as are used for cropping by hand, and is usually called the shearing-frame. At the side of the table or cushion on which the cloth is spread, a long stool is placed, having grooves at the edges to guide the wheels of a carriage, to which the shears are affixed by their bows. There is a carriage for each pair of shears, and they are slowly and gradually moved along the stool, by a cord which winds upon a roller turned by wheel-work; and at the same time, the handles of the shears are continually pulled by a cord connected with a small crank, which turns round very rapidly. The direction of the cuts is the lengthways of the piece of cloth, and the two pair of shears advance across the breadth of the piece until a whole breadth is cut; the machine is then flopped, the shears removed, and the piece of cloth shifted upon the table. These shearing-frames operate very well, but require great care and attention to make the different cuttings join, in order to cut equally over the whole surface.

The machine invented by Mr. Harmar of sheffield was of this description; his first patent was in 1787, and another in 1794. At one period his machines were in general use, but the present shearing-frames, although of the same kind, are very much simplified, and work equally well.

...

In considering the processes of the woollen manufacture, as they were practised forty or fifty years ago, and comparing them with the present practices, we find great changes and improvements, but they are by no means carried to so great an extent as in the cotton manufacture. This is owing in a great degree to the circumstance that the manufacture of woollen cloth was rendered very perfect, as far as the goodness and beauty of the cloth was concerned, long before the improved system was begun; and there were great numbers of experienced and able workmen trained up for each process, who by habit and dexterity performed their work as well as it could be done by machinery. The reduction of labour, or the substitution of ordinary hands for experienced workmen, was in this case all that machinery of the most perfect kind could effect both these were advantages to the public and the manufacturer, but were so directly opposite to the inclination and interest of the able workmen, that we find they have made greater and more effectual opposition to the introduction of improvements in the woollen than in any other of our great manufactures.

At various periods attempts have been made by the workmen to suppress machinery, and many mills have been destroyed. In July 1802, considerable riots took place in Wiltshire and somersetshire, in consequence of an attempt to set up the machines called gig-mills. It was contended that this was the same machine which was prohibited by an ancient statute of Edward VI. The disputes ran so high, that the attention of parliament was called to the subject of the laws then existing for the regulation of the woollen manufacture, and a committee was appointed to investigate the policy of encouraging or regulating machinery. In consequence, all the prohibitions of machinery were suspended. The report of this committee contains the following remarks, some of which are applicable to other manufactures as well as the woollen.

The introduction of the gig-mill and other machines was opposed from an idea that it would throw a considerable number of hands out of work; and it was contended, that it was highly injurious to the quality and texture of the cloth. With respect to the actual effects of the gig-mill and shearing-frame on the cloth, the committee report that decisive evidence has been adduced before them by merchants and manufacturers of the greatest credit and experience, to prove that these machines, especially the gig-mill, when carefully employed, finish the cloth in the most perfect manner, and that manufacturers residing in parts of the country where the gig-mill is not used, frequently send their cloths to a distance to be dressed by it.

It also appeared in evidence, that alarms similar to the present had existed among workmen at the introduction of several of the machines which are now in general use. such alarms have gradually subsided as prejudice died away; and the machines are now fully established, without, as it appears, impairing the comforts or lessening the numbers of workmen. The committee remark with much satisfaction, that in many instances in which it was apprehended that the introduction of particular machines would throw such a number of people out of employment as to occasion great distress, the result has been very different; for besides the occupations which the attendance on such machines has given rise to, a fresh demand for labour to an immense extent has arisen out of the increased sale of the article, in consequence of the cheapness and superior quality of the manufacture.

They approve the system of patents, by which the inventor of any new machine secures to himself the exclusive benefits of his discovery for fourteen years; and only, at the end of that term, they are thrown open to the public; this provides in most cases against the too sudden and general establishment of any invention, by which a number of workmen might at once be thrown out of employment.

They next observe, that if the principles on which the use of these particular machines is objected to were once admitted, it would be impossible to define the limits or to foresee the extent of their applications. If the parliament had acted on such principles fifty years ago, the woollen manufacture could never have attained to near its present extent. The rapid and prodigious increase of late years in all the manufactures and commerce of this country is universally known, as well as the effects of that increase on our revenue and national strength. In considering the immediate causes of that augmentation, it appears to the committee, that it is principally to be ascribed, under the favour of Providence, to the general spirit of enterprize and industry among a free and enlightened people, left to the unrestrained exercise of their talents in the employment of a vast capital, pushing to the utmost the principle of the division of labour, calling in all the resources of scientific research and mechanical ingenuity, and, finally, availing themselves of all the benefits to be derived from visiting foreign countries, not only for forming new and confirming old commercial connections, but for obtaining a personal knowledge of the wants, the taste, the habits, the discoveries and improvements, the productions and fabrics, of other civilized nations. Thus bringing home facts and suggestions, perfecting our existing manufactures, and adding new ones to our domestic stock; opening, at the same time, new markets for the product of our manufacturing and commercial industry, and qualifying ourselves for supplying them.

The committee declare it to be their opinion, that by these means alone, and above all by the effect of machinery in improving the quality and cheapening the fabrication of our various articles of export, notwithstanding a continually accumulating weight of taxes, and with all the necessaries and comforts of life gradually increasing in price, (the effects of which on the wages of labour could not but be very considerable,) our commerce and manufactures have also been increasing in such a degree as to surpass the most sanguine calculations of the ablest political writers who have speculated on the improvements of a future age. The exports of woollen goods at the time of this report, (1807,) amounted to six millions of pounds official, or nine millions of real value.

It appeared also to be an important consideration, of which we should never lose sight, that we are at this day surrounded by powerful and civilized nations, who are intent on cultivating their manufactures and pushing their commerce; and who are more eager to become our competitors in trade, from having witnessed the astonishing effect of our commercial prosperity. The attempts which have been made to carry our machines and implements over to foreign countries, and to tempt our artisans to settle in those countries, evince the importance of machinery, under the directions of men of approved skill, in constructing and using them. It is needless to remark how much these attempts would be favoured by our throwing any obstructions in the way of enterprize and ingenuity. and the free application of capital in this country; for any machines which should be prohibited here would infallibly find their way into foreign nations in a very short time.
