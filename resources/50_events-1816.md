PROVINCIAL NEWS

THE LUDDITES

We are informed that the Luddites in the vicinity of Nottingham have again resumed their mischievous practices of fratme-breaking. The following is an extract of a letter from Nottingham, dated Sunday last, on this unpleasant subject:—

"I am sorry to inform you, that the system of frame-breaking recommenced this morning about two o'clock: nineteen lace-frames were broken at New Radford, near this town, working to Waynman; nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different penple. The cause sssigned for destroying these frames is, that he had just sold nine to the workmen, to be worked out by stopping one-third of the work. There was an armed party, upwards of thirty, and sentinels placed at different avenues, whilst the work of destruction went forward. I have just seen W————, and, from what he says, there are great hopes they will be found out; but one of our magistrates has behaved very ill, in refusing to grant a warrant, being Sunday. There will be no security for property in our business, or any other, until the law is clearly defined, that the county, hundred, or district, *shall* make good all property wantonly or maliciously destroyed: and as the system is spreading to so many parts of the kingdom, we are surprised that the Home Secretary of State should not see it would take away every motive of revenge against personal property."

*Widely syndicated*

The system of frame-breaking re-commenced in the neighbourhood of Nottingham on Sunday morning about two o'clock ; nineteen lace-frames were broken at New Radford working for Mr. Waynman: nine of them were his own, the rest belonging to different people. The cause assigned for destroying these frames is, that he had just sold nine to the workmen, to be worked out by stopping one third of the work. There was an armed party of upwards of thirty ruffians, and sentinels were placed at different avenues whilst the work of destruction went forward.— A magistrate of Nottingham is charged in the London papers with most extraordinary conduct, in refusing to grant a warrant against some persons believed to be part of the offenders, becuase it was Sunday!

TRANSCRIPT at https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2016/06/9th-june-1816-luddites-destroy-19-lace.html to check

*Daring Outrage.*—On Saturday night last, about one o'clock, a party of men, disguised and armed with various sorts of weapons, forced the door of Mr. William Wright, of New Radford, when about seven of them, having obtained a light, rushed up stairs into the workshop, or shops, where they demolished twelve point net lace-frames; and with such vengeance did they exercise their lawless authority, that the frames, which were principally of superior worth, are rendered of very little value. It is very singular, that three of these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago, in his shop, at that village, along with a number more, two of which have made very little work, and the other none since they were repaired. One of the other frames belongs to Mrs. Platts of Nottingham, four to Mr. Wright, and three to Mr. Waynman, lace-manufacturer of Nottingham, who is Mr. Wright's principal employer, and one to Mr. Cole, lace-manufacturer. The loss thus occasioned must be very great; but this is not all, for the depredators, not content with the mischief thus done, very materially damaged or destroyed (principally the latter) about thirty-one yards of net which was upon the frames, and took away six yards. The clock face in the house was struck with great violence with a hammer, and the corner cupboard was beat in pieces. Mr. Wright was from home. Mrs. Wright and family were kept in their respective rooms while the mischief was going on, but, as these nightly violators of property and domestic repose had twice to go down stairs for a light, the guarded parties had opportunity of seeing them, and they agree in stating that seven men were in the shop, while Mrs. Wright thinks she saw twelve men that stood watch on the outside. – When the *workmen*, as those, we understand, are called that actually do the mischief, had completed their purpose at Mr. Wright's, they immediately went in the house of Mr. Mullen, close by, the door of which they broke into pieces, and then rushed up into the workshop, where they demolished seven point net lace frames, six of which belonged to Mr. Waynman above named, and one to Mr. Mullen—one was left uninjured, and is generally understood, from the watchword of alarm being given from without. They also took from Mr. Mullen's, fifteen yards of net and a shirt, and left an instrument behind them like a tomahawk ; they also broke the clock. It is proper to state, that the depredators, in order to render their mischief more complete, broke many of the globes, which contain a mixture of water and aquafortis, and which are used by the workmen in winter evenings to add to the brilliancy of their light, and cast the corroding contents upon the frames. — It seems singular, that neither Mr. Mullen nor his wife heard them ; the reason assigned is this, which is a very feasible one, and, from the respectability of Mr. Mullen's character, is universally believed—he had more liquor than he usually takes in an evening, which caused him to sleep very soundly, as he had been in bed about an hour: and Mrs. Mullen, who was also asleep in bed, is very hard of hearing. When these daring offenders had completed the object of their violence, they discharged several pistols — shouted, as though in triumph, and then retired. Two persons are in custody on suspicion.

TH: NOTE "three of the these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago,"

Evening Mail - Wednesday 03 July 1816

The manufacturing labourers in Nottingham and its vicinity, we are sorry to say, have often betrayed a greater impatience of temporary misfortune than others of their station in life. For this unhappy disposition they are indebted to the prevalence of democratic and disorganizing principles among their neighbours of somewhat superior rank and education. In this part of the country the desperate conspiracy of the Luddites took its rise. A gang of similar miscreants, we are informed, entered the premises of Mr. Heathcote, at Loughborough, on Saturday last, for the avowed purpose of breaking to pieces the whole of his lace-machinery, on account of having learnt that this gentleman intended to reduce the price of labour. The villains were all disguised, and mostly armed. The first person they met was the guard, stationed according to nightly custom watch and protect the property. Him they ordered to lie down with his face to the ground, and not to observe their motions or molest them at his peril. The guard, being faithful to his trust, refused to obey, and was shot dead immediately. Mr. Heathcote employed two sets of men—one to work night, and the other day. Twelve of the latter were at work, whom the murderers seized, and commanded instantly to fall their faces: the men, with the recent example of cruelty before their eyes, did not hesitate to obey; and in the course of one hour from that time these ruffians destroyed, in machinery and goods, property to the amount of 15,000l.

Star (London) - Tuesday 16 July 1816

Discontents.— We have not this week to record any fresh outrages in the midland counties;—but very great and serious alarm is excited at the long continued existence, in the very heart of the kingdom, of that secret association known by the nameof the *Luddites*, whose destructive operations the utmost vigilance of the Executive has not been able to prevent. What excites, perhaps, more alarm than any thing else, is the excellence of their organization, which could not be exceeded by the most regular military force. At the late outrage at Loughborough, independently of the supposed number of nearly 30, who were  actively concerned in committing these excesses in the interior of the factory, it is confidently believed that there were not less than 50 or 60 others stationed on the outside, in the manner of sentinels or patroles, in every direction, and even along the Mill-street, to within a very few yards of the market place of Loughborough. Some of these patroles called aloud, warning, the inhabitants to keep in their beds, and not to exhibit any lights.—(Carlisie Journal.)

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 06 July 1816

LOUGHBOROUGH FRAME-BREAKING

We have this week the painful task of recording an outrqge of the frame-breakers, which, very far, exceeds any thing of the kind that has ever before happened, since enormities of this description first spread terror amongst us in March, 1811; and , well-aware, from the rumours that have been afloat for several days, that our readers would feel the utmost anxiety to learn the particulars of this deplorable catastrophe, we have spared no pains in endeaviouring to satisfy them as much as we possibly could, *"neither extenuating, nor setting down aught in malice."* About a quarter-post twelve o'clock, on Friday night, or rather on Saturday morning last, a number of men, perhaps about thirty, some of whom were armed and disguised entered a small room, called the casting shop, immediately attached to the rear part Messrs. Heathcoat and  Boden's lace-factory, (formerly Mr Douglass's worsted factory,) situate directly at the entrance into the town of Loughborough from Ashby-de-la-Zouch. In this small room were John Asher, Thomas Hyman, aud John Wehsler, three of the men belonging to the factory, the former of whom snatched up a pistol, (kept in the room for the purpose of defence), and pointed it at the Luddites, as they were coming in at the door, but it did not go off. Some one them, in return, instantly fired at Asher, apparently with a blunderbuss, and wounded him in the back of his head, which either caused him to fall, or he was otherwise knocked down. Hyman, being also at the same moment laid prostrate by his side, and Webster, who got out of doors, in the confusion, to try to escape, was quickly brought back again and placed along-side of his two companions. Sufficient guards were then put over the three, and the residue of the gang, with lights their bands, proceeded, without loss of time, through the large room, called the setting up room, to the bottom of the stair-case, where meeting with a youth named Ambrose Woodford, they knocked down, placed a guard over him. as they had done to the others, and then rushed up stairs into the first floor, which is divided into three parts, or shops, containing altogether twenty-three frames, the whole whereof they broke to pieces, having previously secured, in one of the said three shops, James Powel, (commonly called uncle,) William Soars, and John North, in the same manner as their companions below. Ned's band then directed their attention to the large room above, in which were thirty frames and five men, viz. Joseph Sherwin, Samuel Street, William Squires, John Langham, and, Thomas Smith, the first of whom expressed to his associates, a determination to resist the entrance of the invaders into their room, which determination was probably overhead by the latter, for they advanced to the foot the stairs with terrific boldness, a stern voice calling out, *"advance with the blunderbusses—more blunderbusses here."* Sherwin's comrades, now fearing that his opposition might endanger the lives of the whole five, prevailed upon him to change his intention. and let them come quietly, which they then did without delay. No sooner was this accomplished, than the said five were imperiously commanded to prostrate themselves with their faces to the floor, and not to look about them lest death should he their portion, and at the same time guards were fixed over them, as in the former instances of the like nature. This preliminaty being settled, demolition itself was then let loose, and to it went the furies.

After toiling for the space of perhaps seven or eight minutes, they all stopped on a sudden, as if to listen whe-all was right below,—the strictest silence reigned for a few secomds: and afterwards one of them vociferated, *All's well, Ned Ludd do your duty well— its a Waterloo job by G—d,"* when instantly they renewed the work of havock as before, and continued it also for abont the same space of time, thus finishing the destructive scene, except their breaking two incomplete frames, in the setting-up room, as they returned through it upon their retreat. Just before quitting the upper room, one of the Luddites said aloud to his comrades, *"Ned go round and see that you have done your duty well,"* and almost immediately afterwards, the prostrate five were thus addressed, *"Now men, if you can tell us of any machines that are working under price if it be one or hundred miles off, we will go and break them."* Receiving a negative to this question, they directly quitted the factory, enjoining the men belonging to it, with terrible threats, not to stir for the space of ten minutes, and offering to shake hands with Asher, the wounded man; telling him withal that they hoped he would soon get better, or words to that effect; and we are happy to inform the public that he is now quite out of danger, and fast approaching complete recovery. They have not only thus destroyed the machines, but even the lace that happened to be upon the respective rollers is mostly hacked to pieces. In one instance they tore it away and set fire to it upon the floor, the flames whereof coming near to Street, he shifted a little; whereupon one of them gave him a kick, and bid him lie still as the fire would not hurt him; Squires too, who once rather changed his position to avoid danger, received a violent blow near his left eye; and Langham, and North were likewise struck from somewhat similar motives. In fact, it seemed a parlicular maxim with them, as we have before remarked, the deterring as much as possible any one from having a glimpse of their proceedings. Independent of the supposed number of nearly thirty who were actively committing these excesses in the interior of the factory, it is confidently believed that there were not less than fifty or sixty others stationed on the outside in the manner of sentinels or palroles, in every direction, and even along the Mill-street, to within a few yards of the very Market place of the town. Some of these patroles called aloud, warning the inhabitants to keep in their beds, and not to exhibit any lights; in disobedience of which, one person, who endeavoured to go out amongst them, had eight panes directly broken, in one of his windows, and was threatened with death if he did not keep within. About a dozen panes were also broken in the windows of the factory.

According to the best information we can collect, this daring outrage occupied the space of about forty minutes, and some of the neighbours go so far as to say that the posse were headed by a man on horseback, who halted his men, and called over his *numerical* list, when they had quitted the premises about 200 yards, as if to ascertain if any were missing; and that shortly afterwards several shots were fired; either denoting triumph, or by way of defiance as they eventually marched away. We have not heard of any thing having heen carried off except some fire arms belonging to the factory. On the other hand, we understand, they left two of their own ramrods behind them. It is very difficult, at present, to form any estimate of the amount of the damages, even by the proprietors themselves; we have however been told, by an experienced workman, that he thinks each of the fifty-three complete frames will require, on an average, 80*l.* to put them in the same state again; this, of course, would make 4240*l.*—to which if we add, 60*l.* more, for the injury to the two incomplete frames to make round numbers, the account would then stand at 4300*l.* Thus, even admitting it to be any thing near the truth, a serious sum; and yet, it is scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with the general loss: in the first place to the firm by the great delay to their business, whilst the frames are repairing; and to the next place, to near four hundred men, women, and children, thrown out employ. It may not be amiss to add, that about two mouths ago, the workmen at the factory received notice that their wages would all be lowered, which, caused, what is called, a general turn-out.— Some of them however soon relented this, and went in again at the reduced prices, whilst others were not permuted that privilege. These proceedings had engendered considerable discontent, and it is not improbable, but they may have had some influence with the perpetrators of the deed in question. Certain it is that until this circumstance very few manufactories, of equal extent, were carried on, in this part of the kingdom, where the masters men more cordially accorded than they did at this. The Magistragtes of the division have almost incessantly been since occupied in investigatiag the affair, and endeavouring to bring to justice the authors of it. The town crier even went round with his bell on Sunday warning the inn-keepers against keeping their houses open, later than nine o'clock in the evening. Six men, having at different intervals, been taken up, on suspicion, one of who has since been set at liberty; three remain in custody at Loughborough, & the other two were yesterday at noon sent under an escort from that town to Leicester. Some implements supposed to have been used in destroying the machines, have been seized, and are likewise in the possession of the constables employed by the Magistrates in this business. The Magistrates and police-officers in Nottingham, have also been very active, and many houses in this town have been searched on the occasion. A reward of five hundred guineas is offered in the Londo Gazette, for such information as will lead to the conviction of the perpetrators.— *Nottingham Review*

The two men brought to the County Gaol on Thursday, on suspicion of being concerned in the transaction, are named— Benjamin Badder and John Slater. Another man, charged with the same offence, was also committed yesterday.

Leicester Journal - Friday 12 July 1816

In the commitments to the County Gaol during last week, were two men Benjamin Badder and John Slater, both of Nottingham, on suspicion of being concerned in the late attack upon Mr Heathcote's manufactory at Loughborough.—Jas Towle, of Basford, near Nottingham, has also been committed to the said Gaol, charged with being concerned in the said offence. Luddism has very justly been attributed to the influence of those democratic and disorganising principles which have very extensively prevailed among many of the higher classes in the countries where the stocking and lace manufactory is carried on. The charge we believe to be too well founded. Democratic newspapers, and democratic principles, have had there a very wide circulation, and many tradesman and manufacturers, instead of counteracting them, have lent their aid to give them authority. It ts true they did not expect to have their frames broken, their property destroyed, and their servants murdered. They indulged their own political theories, and wished to realize their own schemes of reform and revolution on those above them. But they have had experienee, in the Luddite system, of their own principie carried into effect agaiast themselves; and if the innocent had not, im many instances, like the present, suffered with the guilty, and that demoralising principles were in the lower classes, we should not be sorry for their claims and sufferings. These are the genuine effects of the interest the lower classes in many manufactaring places have been taught by their superiors to take, first, in the French revolution, and then in the character and exploits of Bonaparte.

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Tuesday 13 August 1816

TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES AT LEICESTER. Leicester, Aug. 10. —The trial of Towle, SLater, and Badder, charged with feloniously entering the lace manufactory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden at Loughborough, on the night of the 28th June, came on this morning, at seven o'clock, before the Hon. Baron Graham, when, after upwards of fifty witnesses had been examined for and against the prisoners (whichh occupied the Court more than fourteen hours), the Jury found Towle Guilty; and Slater and Badder— Not Guilty.

Several witnesses swore that Towle was at work at four o'eiock on the Saturday morning, and one also swore he saw him in his (Towle's) house at about 12 the night before, thereby making it appear rather improbable that he should have been at Loughborough on the night in question; but a Nottingham Police Officer, having positively sworn that Towle informed him, a few days before the outrage in question took place, that there would a *job* on Friday night, if not put off;" and also, that he met Towle on the Saturday morning, at six o'clock, at Beeston, near Nottingham; and that in reply to a question put by the Officer, he admitted that he was very unwell and fatigued, which appeared to he the case—this, coupled with the circumstance of his having told the same Officer, when coming down to Red-hill, (the place where criminals were formerly executed), on his road to gael, that he would have to ride *back to that spot*, and desiring the Officer to inform his wife to beg his body, and let it be placed alongside Bamford, who, it will be recollected, was shot in the act of frame-breaking; and several other equally suspicions circumstances, tended to overrule the *alibi* attempted to be set up, and thus to fix guilt upon a man whose firmness on receiving the awful sentence, after standing 14 hours heavily ironed, deserved a better fate.

Never in the memory of the oldest inhabitant did a trial excite such a degree of interest, mixed with apprehension for the public peace, as this. Upwards of 800 persons, among whom were some of the most respectable tradesmen of the town, armed with the oid-fasnioned weapon of defence, viz. the constable's stave, with the Mayor at their head, were called out by our worthy High Sheriff, C. W. Pochin, Esq. of Berkby, whose purely constitutional notions of preserving the public peace are not unworthy of imitation, in a day when military display is so prevailing.

ANOTHER ACOUNT. Leicester, Aug;. 11. —The following brief account of the important trial of the Luddites, continued in our County Gaol, for destroying Heathcote and Boden's machinery, commenced yesterday morning at seven o'clock, and lasted until ten in the evening. Judge Graham was three hours in summing up the evidence; and the Jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty against Towle, who is supposed to be one of the cheifs of this desperate association. The two other prisoners, Slater and Badder, were acquitted. Seventy of their partizans from Loughborough and Nottingham came to prove an *alibi*, but the evidence for the prosecution was so strong against Towle, that all they had to say had no weight with the Jury. Serjeant Vaughan was leading Counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Denman for the prisoners. Serjeant Vaughan's address to the Jury was one of the most able ever delivered in a Court of Justice. It was feared a serious disturbance would take place if the prisoners were found guuilty, but the prceautions taken were so good as to set at defiance the machinations of the disaffected. About 500 constables were sworn in to preserve the peace; and the Gentlemen of the town, with our worthy Chief Magistrate at their head, armed wiih clubs, escorted the Judge to and from the Castle. There were also two or three troops of the 15th Hussars in the villages a mile two from the town, read aty a minute's notice, if an attempt had been made to rescue the prisoners on their return from the Castle, which was fully expected, according to the information the Mayor had received, and which was very probable, considering the late hour at whichd the prisoners were brought hack to gaol.

Also appears as: Stamford Mercury - Friday 23 August 1816

Saturday morning presented a most interesting and grateiful spectacle; the violent and disgraceful proceedings which are stated to have occurred during the late Assizes at Nottingham, and which were said to have intimidated the Jury, from a conscientious discharge of their duty, induced a large portion of the most repectable inhabitants of this town, to rally round the Constituted Authorities, aud give their aid towards the administration of Justice. At 6 o'clock between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange, each receiving a white wand and a club, and headed by the Chief Magistrate, proceeded in fours to the Judges lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street, after the Judges had entered their Carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in. It was soon after 7 o'clock when the prisoners (Towle, Slater, and Badder,) were put to the Bar, and the business continued without any interruption whatever, until half past nine in the evening. After having passed the different sentences upen the prisoners, the Judges were reconducted to their lodgings, im the same manner in which they came. The Chief Magistrate and his party then returned to the Castle, and escorted the Prisoners to Gaol, where having safely deposited them, the assemblage broke up. During the whole of the day, (notwithstanding there was a large assemblage from Nottingham and its environs) the greatest order and decorum were preserved— thus proudly showing to our neighbours, that when *the body is sound at heart*, turbuleuce, anarchy, and disorder will never prevail. If the due administration of Justice is to be wantealy interrupted by threats and lawless violeace, then indeed is there an end of every thing that is sacred in the Constitution! Nottingham may from hence take a salutary lesson, and by a total change of manners and *principles*, again class among the most loyal and best of his Majesty's subjects.

The learned Judge, (Mr. Baron Graham,) was two hours and a quarter in summing up the evidence, taking a clear, distinct, and comprehensive view of the whole particularly as it affected Towle, when after a consultation of a few minutes only, the Jury returned a verdict of guilty against him, and acquitted Slater, (the prosecution against Badder, the other Prisoner, having been previously withdrawn,) the Judge immediately afterwards passed sentence of death upon Towle, who had a determined aspect throughout, and received the awful sentence without any apparent emotion whatever.

Seventy one witnesses in favour of the Prisoners were brought to prove Alibi's.

LEICESTER Assizes.—These assizes closed on Tuesday. *James Towle*, charged with breaking into the manufactory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, at Loughboro', on Friday night the 28th of June, and, with other persons, breaking upwards of 50 lace-frames, was found *guilty*, sentenced to *death*, and left for execution. *John Slater* and *Benj. Badder*, charged with the same offence, were acquitted.—(More than 50 witnesses were examined on these trials, which occupied the Cour» for fourteen hours. Several witnesses swore that Towle was at work at four o'clock on the Saturday morning, and one also swore that he saw him in his (Towle's) house about 12 the night before, thereby making it appear rather improbable that he should have been at Loughborough on the night in question ; but a Nottingham Police Officer, having positively sworn that Towle informed him, a few days before the outrage in question took place, that "there would be *job* on Friday night, if not put off;" and also, that he met Towle on the Saturday morning, at six o'clock, at Beeston, near Nottingham; and that in reply to a question put by the Officer, he admitted that he was very unwell and fatigued, which appeared to the case—this, coupled with the circumstance of his having told the same Officer, when coming down Red-hill, (the place where criminals were formerly executed,) on his road to gaol, that he would have to *ride back to that spot*, and desiring the Officer to inform his wife to beg his body, and let it be placed alongside Bamford, who, it will be recollected, was shot in the act of frame-breaking; and several other equally suspicious circumstances, tended to overrule the *alibi* attempted be set up. The firmness of Towle on receiving the awful sentence, after standing 14 hours heavily ironed, was extraordinary, and worthy of a man less infamous.)

Seems like there was some public discontent at the end of the following trial.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES. The business of primary interest at these assizes was the trials of James Croft and James Brawfield, for arson, and *Thomas Chettle* and *Thomas Glover*, for frame-breaking and burglary. The following particulars will convey a general idea of the leading facts, as they came out evidence.

...

John Chettle and Thomas Glover, *for frame-breaking*.— The prisoners were charged with having, on the night of the 8th of June last, at the parish of Radford, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling house of Wm. Wright, and therein broke and destroyed four lace frames, the property of the said Wm. Wright, and eight other frames in the same dwelling-house. They also stood charged with burglariously entering the said dwelling-house, and stealing two pieces of lace; and likewise with having, on the same night, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling-house of Thomas Mullen, in the said parish, and maliciously and feloniously broke and destroyed therein one lace frame, belonging to the said Thomas Mullen, and six other frames in the same dwelling-house. To these several counts the prisoners pleaded not guilty.— Wm. Wright and others, in their examination before the Court, gave an account of the breaking of the frames, between twelve and one o'clock the night mentioned in the indictment, by a party of men, in disguise, who made their way into the house, chopping the door with an axe, and forcing it open. The four lace frames were in full employ. Mrs. Waynman stated the extent of the damage sustained, including the lace pieces, at £263. — Ann Wright appeared as principal witness for the prosecution. She said, that she was in bed and was alarmed the noise of some persons chopping the door open: that in her fright she "screeted out murder!" She looked out of the window and saw Chettle and Glover, whom she had known for some time; that she distinctly recognised their features and dress, by the light of the moon, and of a candle which stood in the room. She was quite certain as to their persons. That she heard Chettle say, in his own natural voice, when the men were breaking open the door, "Now you may get in;" and in going through the house, he cautioned the rest, saying to them " mind, you are forgetting your voices." The men were in the house about twenty minutes. On her cross-examination she admitted that she had told different stories about the matter, but that what she had before said was under the influence of fear.—The prisoners, in their defence, set up an *alibi*, which was supported by the testimony of a great number of witnesses. On the part of Chettle it was proved by a woman of the name Wacherley, or Waggerley, who had had children by him, that he was present with her, from 10 o'clock at night on the 8th of June, until two the next morning, in company with several other persons, who had met at a room, in Lamb's buildings, Broad Lane, in that town, to make merry on account of the return of her son, who had been just discharged from the army. J. Ash, —— Price, Frederick Wacherley, Jemima Hunt, Ann Jarvis, and another, who were of the party, corroborated this statement; which was further confirmed by Ann Dry and another, who inhabited adjoining rooms, and had seen the prisoner there at the several hours of one and two in the morning. All the witnesses agreed as to the prisoner being fresh in liquor, and that he had slept on a chair in the room from one to two hours. In addition to this, the wife of a person named Shaw, swore that she saw and spoke to Chettle, at her own door, in Back Lane, about 20 minutes past two in the morning; that he appeared quite fresh, and was going towards home, at New Radford. Witness had been washing and preparing her children's clothes, for them to go to the Sunday School in the morning, and she happened to go to the door at the moment Chettle was coming up the lane. Witness knew Ann Wright; but such was her character, that she would not believe any thing she said upon oath.— On the part of Glover, Mrs Cooper, her servant, and several other persons swore, that he was sitting in the tap-room, at the Odd Fellows' Arms public-house, New Radford, in company with four or five more, who had been partaking of a beef steak with him, from half-past nine or ten o'clock at night of the 8th of June, till two the next morning, and that they never lost sight of him.

The Learned Judge (Graham), in summing up, made some pointed remarks the nature of the evidence brought forward in favour of the prisoners; when the Jury retired, and after consulting together some time, returned a verdict of *not guilty*.

As soon as the Jury had pronounced their verdict, loud shouts of approbation were set up by the crowd assembled in and about the hall.

The trial lasted thirteen hours, and did not terminate until past two o'clock on Sunday morning.— Soon after night-fall, such was the impatience manifested by the crowd for the issue of the trial, that it was with the greatest difficulty that they were restrained from offering personal violence to the members of the Court; and insulting language was several times addressed to the Judge.

On Monday morning the prisoners were again brought up, and after a short hearing, were acquitted on the other two charges.

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 24 August 1816

We regret to observe that the pernicious spirit of Luddism still exists in Leicester, Nottingham, Lincoln, and other manufacturing counties. At the late Nottingham Assizes several desperate characters of this gang were tried, but acquitted. During the trials, says the Lincoln Paper of the 16th instant, Mr. Justice Graham, who tried the prisoners, had the most scandalous language addressed to him in going to, and returning from Court, and many members of the Court were also grossly insulted. There is no member of the Bench more distinguished for mildness, urbanity, and genuine humanity, than Mr. Justice Graham; and it must fill every person with indignation who hears of this infamous conduct.

We understand that a fine of £500 has been set on the county, for the injurious example it has afforded in the excesses by which it has been distinguished. This outrageous behavior will have its effect; it will unite all respectable and peaceable persons in the determination of resisting and putting down such dangerous insolence. At Leicester Assizes, which succeeded those of Nottingham, a large portion of the most respectable inhabitants of Leicester rallied round the constituted authorities, and gave their aid towards the faithful execution of justice. Between two and three hundred assembled at the Exchange; each received a white wand and a club, and headed by the chief Magistrate, they proceeded in fours to the Judges' lodgings, where they formed on each side of the street; after the Judges had entered their carriage, they escorted them to the Castle, and the trials of the Luddites were immediately proceeded in. One desperado named Towle was convicted, and sentenced to suffer death. During the whole day, notwithstanding there was a large assemblage from Nottingham and its environs, the greatest order and decorum was preserved—thus showing to our neighbours, says the Leicester Journal, that when THE BODY IS SOUND AT HEART, turbulence, anarchy, and disorder will never prevail. If the due administration of justice is to be wantonly and seditiously interrupted by threats and violence, then indeed there is an end of everything that is sacred to the Constitution. Nottingham, and all other places, may from hence take a salutary lesson.

Wright and others, with having, in company with divers other persons, on the morning the 9th of June, with force and arms entered the dwelling house of the said Wm. Wright, at Radford, and wilfully broken and destroyed 12 lace frames. Upwards of 70 witnesses were examined their trial, which occupied the Court for 13 hours; and in the end the prisoners were acquitted. They were also acquitted upon another indictment for breaking seven frames on the premises of Thomas Mullen, at Radford, and a third indictment for stealing lace upon the premises of Wright.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 30 November 1816

EXECUTION OF J. TOWLE THE LUDDITE

Towle was apprentice to his father, a frame-work-knitter ; and no particular circumstance marked his character, good or bad, until he arrived at manhood; but since that period, his life has several times been in jeopardy. In the year 1814 he was accused of being one of the band of frame-breakers that destroyed some frames in Mr. Garton's house, in New Basford, the village in which Towle then lived; and at the Lent Assizes following, he was put to the bar, in the County-Hall, in Nottingham, and tried for the offence; but after a long consultation, the Jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. In July, 1816, he was, however, again committed to prison on the charge for which he has now paid the penalty of the law. The offence having been perpetrated at Loughborough, he was of course confined in Leicester gaol, and on Saturday morning, August 10, about seven o'clock, he, along with John Slater and Benjamin Badder, was put to the bar. The trial lasted upwards of twelve hours, and after Baron Graham, who presided, had given his charge, the Jury found Towle *Guilty of aiding and abetting, but not of firing the pistol at Asher*. And, in consequence of the verdict, Baron Graham passed sentence of death upon him.

In the course of the trial, Mr. Denman, one of the counsel for the prisoners, made some objections to the wording of the indictment; and the prisoner was respited, in order that the opinion of the twelve Judges might be taken on the subject.

On the 13th November the case was argued. The Judges being unanimous in their opinion, that the objections could not be sustained, the law was ordered to take its course.
  
On the morning of Wednesday se'nnight, he was taken, under an escort, in a chaise, to the building, an appendage to the New Bridewell now erecting, a short distance from the west end of the Infirmary. At an early hour, great numbers assembled to see the new drop (which had been placed there only the day before) and kept increasing until twelve o'clock, when Towle, with a firm and undaunted step, came upon the platform, attended by the Sheriff and his deputy, the chaplain, the two gaolers, &c. after paying the utmost possible attention to the prayers of the chaplain, with a firm and audible voice, he gave out one of Dr. Watts's admirable hymns, beginning with

> " Oh ! for an overcoming faith,  
> To cheer my dying hours;
> To triumph o'er the monster death,  
> With all his frightful powers."

He gave out the whole of this hymn, two lines at a time, and joined in singing it with the utmost fervency. About half past twelve, every thing being ready, the platform fell, and launched him into eternity, in the presence of an immense number of spectators, who conducted themselves in the most orderly manner, and without the least attempt at disturbance.

After hanging the usual time, his body was demanded by his cousin Josiah Towle, who, before he could obtain it, was required to put his hand to the following document:—

"The corpse of James Towle having been delivered to me on behalf of his mother, who is desirous of interring it at Basford, I hereby undertake that the same shall be buried there before sunset tomorrow, with all possible privacy, and I hereby make myself responsible that there shall be no public exhibition, either previously to, or at the funeral, and particularly that the corpse shall not be detained at the town of Nottingham, but that the same shall be conveyed, as privately as possible, through that town, and in case of any disturbance taking place, in consequence of the conveyance or burial of the said corpse, I consent that this paper may be produced in evidence against me. " JOSIAH TOWLE X his Mark.

" Dated this 20th of Nov. 1816."
  
" I further engage that the corpse shall not be halted or detained at any other place, between Leicester and Basford, than the following:-
  
" To bait one hour at Rothley-House'.
  
" To put up for the night or bait at Costock.
  
"To bait for one hour at Bradmore, and from thence to Basford without stopping."
  
The body was conveyed through Nottingham during the course of Wednesday night, and on Thursday afternoon, was committed to the earth in Basford church-yard, by the side of his father, in the presence of thousands of spectators ;-every thing being conducted in the most peaceable and orderly manner.

James Towle was about five feet two inches high, 34 years of age, and has left a wife and four children to lament his untimely end. During the whole of his confinement, he conducted himself with great propriety, but elicited nothing that would at all implicate the *Luddites*, in whose dark and diabolical system he has been the first to suffer. His wife and four children, with some relatives, arrived on Sunday, and continued until Tuesday. The following letter, addressed to his wife, written after her departure, and late on the night previous to his execution, will best exemplify the tranquil state his mind was brought to from an attention to religious exercises since his condemnation:—

" Dear Wife— In a few more hours I shall be no more. But my dear creature, in my last moments it is my duty to beg of you to seek for that peace in God which is far beyond my pen to describe or tongue to speak; and my dear girl, above all, I hope you will bring my dear children up in the fear and love of God, and then you will find a friend-a friend that will support you through all the troubles of this world, and in the hour of death give you that comfort that will raise your mind far above all the treasures that the earth can afford. My dear girl, this afternoon there has been a gentleman that wished to see me, and promised me that he would do a something for you towards making you comfortable, and my dear, I have no doubt but my mother will be agreeable for you and my dear children to be with her, and I hope and trust she will be a mother and is guardian to my sweet babes, which in so short a time will be fatherless. Dear wife, my last words are, may God Almighty bless and protect you and my dear children in this world, and prepare you for the world to come, is my sincere prayer.

"From your dying husband

"James Towle.

"Tuesday night, ten o'clock"

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 02 February 1839

Death of an alleged Luddite.

On Friday, Mr. Thos. Glover, lacemaker, died at Nottingham, aged 54. His death was very sudden ; he fell down in a fit, when at work, and an inquest was held upon his body. The deceased was well known, in consequence of being tried, along with John Chettle, before Baron Graham, in the county hall at Nottingham, on Saturday the 3rd of August, 1816, charged with breaking the lace machines of Mr. Mullen and Mr. Wright, at New Radford. That memorable trial commenced on Saturday afternoon, and did not terminate until after two o'clock on Sunday morning. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Reader were counsel for the prosecution ; the present Lord Chief Justice, then Mr. Denman, was the sole counsel for the prisoners, and added to his well-earned reputation by the ability with which he conducted and established the *alibi* set up, unquestionably the moat complete of any it was ever our lot to witness in a court of justice. Fortunately for the public peace, the result of the trial was the acquittal of both prisoners. Had it been otherwise, the most fearful consequences would doubtless have ensued, for the body of the hall was for hours in possession of a number of men, who would not suffer a light to appear in court, excepting on the bench and the counsel table. It is notorious that armed men were in the outer hall, and the constables and javelin-men were quite unable to maintain order. Never shall we forget the shout with which the verdict of Not Guilty was received, and the unavailing attempts of the Judge to silence it. Since that period, Glover has sustained many vicissitudes of fortune, but latterly he has been much reduced in consequence of the great depreciation in the value of lace machinery. John Chettle, his fellow prisoner, died on the 15th of July last.— *Nottingham Review*.

Aris's Birmingham Gazette - Monday 30 December 1816

It is with the greatest concern we feel it our duty, this week, to record one of the most atrocious attempts at murder that has ever disgraced this county :—On Sunday evening last, about a quarter before eight o'clock, as George Kerry and his family (who reside at a lone house, by the road leading from Bobbers mill to Bilborough) were sitting by the fire, at supper, their house was entered by two men in disguise. Kerry, in attempting to seize the foremost man, was shot at by him, but without effect ; during the struggle the other man fired, but fortunately the slugs only grazed his head. The murderers thinking their object attained, instantly departed. The most prompt assistance was rendered by the neighbours, and the police from Nottingham; but owing to the frost and the extreme darkness of the night, no trace whatever could be discovered of their retreat. On further enquiry, we learn, that a third person was standing at the door during the transaction, and the prevailing opinion is, that the party were *Luddites*, and that they came from New Radford. *Nottingham Journal*
