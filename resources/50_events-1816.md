Aris's Birmingham Gazette - Monday 30 December 1816

It is with the greatest concern we feel it our duty, this week, to record one of the most atrocious attempts at murder that has ever disgraced this county:— On Sunday evening last, about a quarter before eight o'clock, as George Kerry and his family (who reside at a lone house, by the road leading from Bobbers mill to Bilborough) were sitting by the fire, at supper, their house was entered by two men in disguise. Kerry, in attempting to seize the foremost man, was shot at by him, but without effect; during the struggle the other man fired, but fortunately the slugs only grazed his head. The murderers thinking their object attained, instantly departed. The most prompt assistance was rendered by the neighbours, and the police from Nottingham; but owing to the frost and the extreme darkness of the night, no trace whatever could be discovered of their retreat. On further enquiry, we learn, that a third person was standing at the door during the transaction, and the prevailing opinion is, that the party were *Luddites*, and that they came from New Radford. *Nottingham Journal*
