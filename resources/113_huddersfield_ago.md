HUDDERSFIELD SEVENTY YEARS AGO

TO DO


It not uninteresting to the present generation to learn a little of what Huddersfield upwards of seventy years ago It was but village compared with it is' now Great and wonderful been its development within the allotted span of life so great indeed that young Huddersfield will scarcely credit what I am about to narrate I who write this a native of the town but I no pretensions to considered a chronicler or historian I shall merely relate a few things that came under my own observation I was a boy I will do so with as much truthfulness as memory will allow to time and date I shall not attempt to be precise It cannot expected that I should know much about them as I was but a youngster at the time of which I write My sketch shall of New Street it was in those days Between the bottom of High Street and the foot of Cloth Hall Street there were but two shops In one Tommy Ludlam whitesmith and ironmonger supplied the Huddersfieldians with kettles pans and in the other Tommy Bradley Saddler plied his needle and waxthread These two were near neighbours All the rest were wool marts and warehouses or private dwelling houses At that time had no King Street The old shambles and slaughter house stood where King Street joins Street I well remember standing boy on butcher's cratch and looking out of the grated window of the slaughterhouse into the fields below where the late Shambles afterwards stood There behind the building a large pool of blood and refuse which had run from the slaughter-house Such a nuisance these days of sanitary inspectors and district medical officers would not be tolerated The fields below were that time called the Bone Crofts Soon after this the old shambles and slaughter-house were taken down which might be about 1807 The bricks of which it had been built were taken to Chancery Lane to build what were called the Livery Stables There they remained for a number of years until they were Booth sold and taken away to do duty again I suppose I must now say little more about Street the erection of humble cottages After the and Cloth Hall Street What I am about to tell shambles had been removed cellars were dug for did not come under my own observation It was the buildings which now on the right as one communicated me by one who had seen the state looks down King Street In the course of their of things he described My informant Thomas operations the excavators laid bare a number of Coldwell sergeant in the old volunteers a very very large tree roots and some trunks of trees respectable man I don't know that I can do These still remained perfectly and were as better than give the narrative his own words black as ebony The cabinet makers bought them he gave it to me standing near the spot for use in their work The corner shop next to at the time I remember he when I the Boot and Shoe Inn was built by the late Mr boy we had no road from New Street Joe Kaye builder The next to it was I believe to the Cloth Hall There was only a foot-erected by John Eastwood dyer The large room path through the fields with hedge-rows on each of this house was'the only theatre we for some side To get into the footpath had to go years Godfrey Berry and Doctor Wrigley built two three steps and then stride a flag-the houses which stand on the other side at the stone end called lipping or stepping stone top of King Street I well remember searching for birds' nests and But I get back to New Street On the getting hips and haws in the hedgerows that divided bottom side were some old buildings which the fields One of the gate-posts slotted out converted into a cotton factory by the father of to hold the edgestone in its place These gate the late Mr John Sutcliffe wool merchant Here posts have a further history which may interest-put up a steam engine which I believe was the ing to some When taken from the bottom of second steam engine erected in Huddersfield I Cloth Hall Street they were removed to the top have lively recollection of sitting whilst quite a of the Jown to be gate posts for the garden of little boy the engine beam as it lay in the grass the fields below After the works were running I two women with a stick in each hand battering away at the cotton as it lay on of wickerwork and terrible clatter they made The cotton opened this primitive process and afterwards picked by women and children They no seutshing machine in those days I believe that the first steam engine in Huddersfield put at Mr Fisher's factory at the top of Chapel Hill Now the number of temples to Cotton and Fleece the deities of the place erected within one man's remembrance may counted by tens nay almost hundreds Let us return to New Street The large block of buildings extending from Smiles's to the Yorkshire Bank was built by Sir John Ramsden They were formerly called the New or Brick Buildings and were let at £20 year for each dwelling house and that thought a great rent After while the rents were raised to £22 whereupon as I was told one who knew the circumstances of the case old Tom Walker the tnbber said he would have to quit it impossible to pay such rents and live The house at the corner of Cloth Hall Street and New Street now in the occupation of Mrt Smiles let as a cloth finishing establishment at that day called cropping shop I used to sit on the doorstep and watch those inside at work A stream of blue ran down from the door across the causeway and down into the street Two used to work at dubbing board scraping down cloth with teazles raise the pile I also heard the shears at work in the chamber above taking off the superfluous nap from the cloth Modern machinery changed all this The original in the so-called Brick Buildings have almost disappeared The only shop that retains them is Walton's cigar shop The name of Walton is still there as it was of seventy years ago The shop then kept by Neddy Walton leather breeches maker This said Neddy Walton was the only constable we had in Huddersfield at that day Whenever his official services were required he to be at hand Did any fight or disturbance of any kind occur there was the constable little consequential man proud of his authority and brandishing little staff in his hand At the low side of the Market Place there were some old buildings with hops below and separate dwellings above The way into the houses some steps which led to gallery supported by stone pillars One of these pillars is now at the Royd's Farm near Belle Vue where it supports the roof of one of the cowsheds might be imagined it is of very-rude workmanship the gallery stood the old "Brown Cow" kept by Daniel Armitage Thither Cockle Jack used to come from once or a week with a hag of cockles mussels to sell On such occasions the bellman sent round with the following announcement:— "There is a large of fine West country cockles and mussels brought into and at the Brown Inn they are set down will be sold at fourpence per quart" The only other source of fish supply for the town fish-stall kept by old woman named Bradley stall a little round table with a few fish upon it It stood at the bottom comer of the Market Place This Mrs Bradley grandmother t Mrs Porter of the Cloth Hall Market The fish trade been in the Bradley family ever since About that time say 1804 we had but watchmaker or rather mender in the town This an old woman of name of Wilson grandmother to wife of Mr Joe Wood fishmonger little shop stood about where the Wellington Inn stands had another remarkable woman a°ut that time in the person of old Mrs Murgatroyd did the business of the Post office the price each letter for at that time they were paid for delivery and one old woman named Brooksbank had all the delivering to attend to Afterwards her daughter Betty took the hand and held of letter carrier to the district for long time Our office then down in 01 Street at the right of going down is called the Office Yard Where would the two poor old women be now an attempt to discharge the postal duties of our greatly increased and rapidly increasing town? Perhaps Mr Smith might give an adequate answer to the question In my early boyhood we had a theatre down that yard an old laith or barn converted from its original uses for the purpose It a good size and held a largenumber of people JohnStanton the celebrated scene painter the proprietor But to return to the Market Place Where the West Riding Bank now stands there stood old public-house commonly called the Doll Hole kept by Thomas Paking On the top side where Crossley's stationer's shop is once a butcher's shop kept certain Tommy Green The inhabitants of Huddersfield then badly supplied with water of very inferior quality Godfrey Berry leading in the town proposed scheme whereby a larger supply of water might be obtained His project follows: — large reservoir be constructed in Old Market Place into which the Bradley Spout water to be brought Then there were to be four pumps one at each comer of the Market Place from which the people might fetch water Well Godfrey and his colleagues to work with a right good will at the new water- works large hole dug which might be I dare say thirty yards by seven This they built round and 'arched over and all was ready they made the astounding discovery that water would not run up-hill The project therefore dropped A considerable amount of public money had been spent and nothing accomplished The large vault however is there still and when Huddersfield becomes a bonding town it may come in useful At one time we had but three draper's in Huddersfield One on the Upper side of the Market Place was kept by John Stock another opposite the Old Church by Sammy Clay and the third at the bottom comer of the Market Place Mr Atkinson The name is now Cooper and Co We had also but two druggist's shops one kept by Thomas England the other at the Comer of Cross Church Street opposite the church by S old Mrs Batley who kept the Red Lion Inn They remained there for a number of years and when the railway companies required the ground they were removed to Highfield near the chapel there to do duty gateposts in John Marshall's field That the last place I them in they did not rest there long They wore doomed to again disturbed When the ladies' seminary was built there they were re moved further into the late James Marshall's field near the barn There I believe they are at the present day My informant also said that if one would look through the iron gates of Joe Hargh's (now Mr Learoyd's) warehouse yard one would see quantity of green grass growing at the back which grass is part of the green fields I have been speaking of I myself well remember seeing that j neighbourhood a plot of green field many years after the time of which I have spoken Cloth shops are now built upon it Opposite the White Hart Inn a wide open space of ground extending from Whiteley's paper warehouse to the Green Dragon broken only one warehouse few pits and timber occupied part of it I remember large menagerie of wild beasts exhibiting opposite the White Hart From the Cloth Hall to the bottom of Macaulay Street one open field with tenters in it for the drying of cloth I will move on to High Street and Buxton Road I can remember that "when that I but a little tiny boy" I went along with some other boys to see some rabbits and guinea pigs in a cottage that stood opposite the Wool Pack Inn Of these cottages there were two of the kind commonly called one-deckers One was occupied a person named Cliffe shoemaker The present generation will perhaps be surprised I tell them that those two humble cottages comprised the whole of Buxton Road and the greater part of High Street All open fields and hedge-rows from the bottom of High Street to the top of Chapel Hill We had no Albion Street no John Street no South Parade The green expanse unbroken save for hedge-rows and trees and a footpath which ran across the fields to Outcote Bank

The first innovation on green fields was Biding School It erected for the Yeomanry Cavalry to drill and practise in Afterwards became a theatre concert room then for number of years waggon warehouse and lastly iron warehouse it a concert room heard sing there used to ride hay-cart in blythe haymaking time to the field where Albion Street now is The next erection was made by Mr John Taylor in what now called South Parade Mr Taylor connected with the local militia the house came to be sometimes called "Local Hall" next the opposite end of the fields nearly the bottom of High Street It built by Scotchman named Oliver i wool merchant The remainder of the boundary of High Street a field that ran up to top house same street where Love's shop is Where High Street Chapel now stands there stood a smaller chapel which opened in 1814 Before that a large laithe or barn stood there In this barn and rest of the lads thought grand thing be allowed to down the fragrant hay in the loft time-blackened cobweb-hung In the fields the Wool Pack to the houses the top of Chapel Hill the first to build was grocer baker named Anby Beatsonf The building he erected now a furniture shop I will now move to Ramsden Street On the south side from the Pack down to Clegg Lane now Commercial Street there not house neither was there one in Clegg Lane On the north side all the way from the top corner where the watchmaker's shop now is to the Ship Inn near the Shorehead there not single house I have often gathered mushrooms in field where Street Chapel" now stands I mention these things to show rapid progress Huddersfield has made in single time We had waterworks Huddersfield but they were of a very primitive kind as you see The source of our supply was the river Folly Hall or Bridge In a cottage to Mr Eastwood's was erected a forcing engine or pump This driven by water-wheel and sent turbid water up Huddersfield The pipes that conveyed the water were large tree trunks with a and a half inch hole bored through them lengthways They tapered down orfe and the the other end widened little to admit the tapering end thHS what is called joint These wooden ran under the Canal hill to the of Otticote Bank along called Upper to the higher of the town finally discharged their into small reservoir which stood near Midgley's From this the received it supply may of the size of mains from the incident It so the supply one part the stopped so that the inhabitants of that were left "and dry" Much digging searching to discover the obstruction last cause of the mischief revealed Imagine the astonishment of all when found large trout had stuck fast one of the Connected with these waterworks old named Betty Earnshaw rather masculine looking woman peculiarity about one of her eyes She carried large on her shoulder to turn the water in the various of the town The servant girls who had to rise early on washuif mornings well knew to get early supply of water for their work professed to tell fortunes for the silly lasses that what with water-turning and fortune-telling old Betty managed to turn many an honest penny and contrived to be never loss for adropof "something good" lad I had go to Lockwood for milk we had no milk hawkers in those days I passed Folly Hall I used to be attracted by the screeching and groaning of the old pumping engine It sounded if had not a drop of oil for twelve months or more I peep through broken window and watch the crazy at work would make desperate effort for a few seconds and then groaningly move off again Thus painfully and laboriously the supply of water pumped up from the polluted river A little further on at Folly Hall my eye caught sight of he blaze of a furnace I crossed the road and looked into a cottage through the place where a pane of glass been There I an old woman hard at breaking the pigs of with heavy sledge hammer she had thus broken it put the pieces her head carried them up some steps and throw them into the furnace Those who have been engaged in this hard hot work of furnace-tending and those who have seen the swarthy grimy toilers toiling and perspiring at their work may imagine whether or not that old woman fairly earned her bread Another time I went behind the cottage there saw horse trotting round gin which worked large blacksmith's bellows used melt the iron the furnace They had no other method that day as it before the invention of the or rotary bellows I every to believe that this was the first foundry Huddersfield or neighbourhood never knew or heard of one before this one It was established by two partners Messrs Holmes Prince They carried on business for some might have done well Prince the experienced partner left the firm Holmes who had previously been coachman to Colonel Smithson nothing of the By careless and intemperate habits he allowed business to fall and himself finally became a bailiff The foundry by Jonathan Brook at bottom of Bank and after came Mills Aspley foundry Hall stood changes foundry was succeeded by these by leadworks iron-works 1833 the George Smith established spirit store ground one of little cottages once stood primitive right to the river open

were not wide of the mark Thus ended the Folly Hall fight where the vanquished fled without being attacked or even threatened victors were wholly of the brilliant they had effected I will move over to the other side of the road large buildings three storeys comprising four tenements built I have told by a person named Duke Nebden This stood alone the fields and the people of Huddersfield considered it sheer stupidity to build so large a place in such an out of the situation They therefore called it Folly Hall and from surrounding district took its name I will now move little farther on to Rashcliffe or it is named old documents Rushcliffe What was called Rashcliffe Wood was a very dense thick -wood of which the two parts were called North and South Sides On the North side opposite Benjamin Kaye's butcher's shop stood out large projecting rock on which grew oak tree From wood ran on as far as Mr Fisher's plantation with not house in the intervening space The South Side commenced at the to Rashcliffe Hill ran on as church Nor were there here any houses On the top a grass field with footpath running one side the character of scenery is greatly changed The woods like a forgotten dream the fields are cut up spoiled and rookery of houses has taken up the place which they have vaeated The to build in the fore-wood Mr Abraham Kilner heald and Blay maker I think the house erected is the third from the corner I have now devoted sufficient time and space to my sketch of this district I will therefore retrace my steps to Huddersfield my former paper while speaking of Market Street I forgot to mention that in this street for several years magisterial business of the town done Messrs Joe Haigh of Springwood House and Haigh Allen were then on the bench the second house from the corner lived Bradley the magistrates' clerk and in the front chamber of house was our High Court of Justice Before that we had no Court of Judicature all in Huddersfield Our wrongs and were all

once out three 100 yards range I can recollect the time our streets were all in darkness People about at night with hand glass lanterns and our shops were lighted with candles or muddy oil lamps was then so by our authorities that our main streets should lighted up For this purpose lamp-posts were down at wide intervals These were furnished with glasses something like an inverted beehive them were placed oil lamps gave dim uncertain light and served ' only to make darkness visible By eleven or twelve o'clock they usually nearly all "winked up" was not at that day as an illuminator The used in Huddersfield was made Wm Waite a plumber and glazier His shop next door to Globe Inn gas apparatus was in the back workshop and from there he lighted up his shop window This new light in the district created great wonder The shop front surrounded nightly by a crowd of gaping spectators who marvelled greatly how anyone could set lire to the end of a cold lead pipe The first inn Huddersfield which gas burnt the White Lion in Cross Church Street Mr Waite made a large leathern bag something like a round bellows and took it to the filled gas placed it under the table in which

TO DO

 HUDDERSFIELD SEVENTY YEARS AGO -HI I remember we had considerable domestic manufactures carried on in the neighbourhood Some would have looms in their chambers others spinning jennies having about forty spindles each Others would spin single thread on a one spindle Let Haigh an old woman used to go to the mill and bring home bag of refuse wool such scraped from the carding engine Right good long wool it though it had some dirt in it Some of this wool she would place her tumming stock which implement I will try to describe card nailed upon board which stood foot above a trestle to which it nailed fast On trestle the operative sat astride when work The other board also with card nailed upon it and with two handles on the other side with which to work it As I have said some wool was placed upon the fixed card and the loose card was scraped over it till the fibre of the wool combed all one way then the card reversed and the wool stripped off the lower card in soft fiossy mass about the shape and size of small mackerel After sufficient quantity of these cardings had been got together Letty would bring out her spinning wheel commence spinning She first wrapped the carded wool round the fingers of her left hand Then she would apply the wool to the spindle out thread about three yards long and then run back and wind it on to the spindle By repeated of this kind she would form good sized cop on the spindle and when had spun a number of cops she would reel them into hanks These she took to the fud market to sell The fud market held in little chamber over the old Plough Inn just opposite the Green Dragon It was attended by buyers from Dewsbury and Batley who used this hand-spun material listing and carpet weaving Query — Where — — - would the old woman get wool to make fud of now-a-days? We had shoddy mongers or mungo workers at that day The worsted manufacturing must been in very primitive state at the beginning of the present century The worsted like the fud was drawn out in a single thread on the old spinning wheel Of this I could if necessary advance convincing proof My aunt Betty was widow woman lived in a small cottage and made her living by spinning worsted on single spindle A man came from Bradford every Saturday and brought with him large quantity carded or combed wool in small detached portions about five six inches long and very light soft I think they were called pluckings He would bring these pluckings distribute them amongst those for him in Huddersfield and would at the same time take away their spun worsted in the shape of hanks On winter's evening I and other children of the neighbourhood would go into old Betty's cottage to see her spin and hear her tell strange stories and "boggard" tales as she spoke with her light wheel humming a dreamy accompaniment she worked these pluckings in much the same manner as I have said old Let Haigh worked her fud The difference that whilst Let's was for the Huddersfield fud market my aunt's for the Bradford market to be woven into stuffs Now these wheels with their drowsy hum and rattling spindles are things of the past Just before the time to which my recollections extend perhaps about the year 1800 our head constable was a respectable tradesman of the town His Samuel Mosley He had a large dog which rejoiced in the name of Towser After while on the "Love my dog love me" principle the dog's master was commonly called Towser also He had no lock-up in which to put prisoners so one was built at that part of the town called Low-green near where Hadfield's shop now stands When this prison was finished it called Towser Castle and when prisoner placed in durance vile-he euphemistically said to have "gone to Towser" When the streets were named Castle-gate received its name from Towser Castle which stood there In my young days men used to be flogged through the streets of Huddersfield for petty larceny They were tied behind cart or van that came from Wakefield The punishment commenced at the Cloth Hall The victims were flogged their backs with the cat they reached ther Dog Inn in the Old Street I believe man of the name of Tim Knowles was the last punished in way His offence stealing ducks I have a few more reminiscences of Huddersfield and its people in my young days which may be worth recording At one time during my remembrance had but three Irishmen in tho town One James Rourke a cropper or cloth-finisher another James Conelly a horse dealer and the third was Martin Webb a cloth-finisher merchant At one time too it might about 1806 we had auctioneer in the town Samuel Lancaster father of the late celebrated auctioneer John- Lancaster My father was accustomed to send me when a boy on the Saturday for the Leeds Mercury It was published only once a week and the price was sixpence and at one time I think it sevenpence The size was not equal to that of tho supplement of the Huddersfield Examiner We had to fetch them from the bookseller's in the town as there were no colporteurs then The paper had a red duty stamp at one comer but that is now happily done away with Things are rather different now when we can have a daily paper brought to our door for the small sum of halfpenny On one occasion my father took me and my brother to a hatter's to give each a new hat The hatter advised him to have stamp pasted in each "for" said he "Jack Allan is very busy knocking folk's hats off all who are without stamp their are fined" It was the law that every one must have a shilling pasted his hat or subjected to a fine The stamp a piece of black cotton nearly the size of the crown of the hat with the royal arms stamped upon it in white It said that the informer received half of the fine I can just remember the soldiers pomading powdering tying each other's back hair They wore their hair long tied with riband and hanging down their backs with a tuft of hair at the end and plenty of powder on the back the head This method of dressing hair not peculiar to army People generally wore queues At that day they fashionable My father used to wear one The last in Huddersfield to retain the old fashion was I believe Mr Frank Downing the grocer When a middle class fully dressed in those days he wore his queuue down his back blue coat with gilded buttons buckskin leather breeches and top boots a frilled shirt with the frill sticking out about three inches and gold brooch stuck in it They looked very smart and jockey-like We had policemen but in their a few old men employed watchmen They commonly called "Old Charleys" Their dress was a long top coat with several capes and a large slouched hat The guardians of the night would go ten o'clock swinging large Horn-lantern nearly large firkin and bawling out the time every half-hour of night something this "Half eleven o'clock weetish!" They were also provided with large wooden to call their to they want assistance It was ridiculous think that these superannuated old fellows would prevent burglaries by night They the of j their by carrying their light and shout- ing the hour even more effectually than a modern policeman with his bull's eye and heavy tread I always considered their way proceeding tantamount to saying "Get out of the way I am coming" Such were the guardians of the night at that day They remind us of Milton's words in his "II Penseroso":— "The bellman's drowsy charm bless our doors from nightly harm" Herrick in his poem of "The Bellman" thus gives the bellman's blessing : — "From noise of scare-fires rest ye free From murder Benedicite! From all mischances that may fright Your pleasing slumbers in the night Mercy secure ye all and keep The goblin from ye while ye sleep!" During the French war with England at the beginning of the present century it strongly suspected that Napoleon the First equipping a fleet for the invasion of England had no telegraph or railroad so system of beacon fires was adopted It was so arranged that in order to spread the alarm simultaneously throughout the country' the highest hill tops in England and Scotland should be provided with a fire beacon There was one the top of Castle Hill It large of tar with hemp old tarred ropes in it which would make a great blaze when set on fire These beacons were within distances of each other that they might be seen from one to the other I doubt whether this would have been the case on a foggy day or night but however this maybe these were the adopted to apprise the nation that foreign army was about to land upon our coasts It so happened that one night about ten o'clock a roguish wag set fire to our beacon and we could see the blaze very plainly in Huddersfield I shall never forget the alarm and consternation which the blazing pyre caused that night All out of their houses to see the flare of the burning beacon Men stood in groups with woeful faces discussing what was best to be done Women ran about from house house screaming "The French are coming the French are coming! We shall be murdered Oh! What shall we do?" Our local militia was then called out They made very poor muster were suddenly taken ill others as suddenly fell lame Still there were many staunch true amongst them were soon in marching order and off they tramped to the sound drum fife bugle with the wives sweethearts of some of the men following the company It was not until they got to Marsden that it discovered that the beacon firing was a false alarm' The recollection of the beacon brings to my mind the following curious story which has some bearing on the threatened invasion from France Old Squire Beaumont of Whitley Hall of cock-fighting notoriety had a large rookery the stately trees which formed and still form the avenue to the Hall About the time of which I write he took it into his head to have all the rooks off and the nests destroyed so utterly to break up the noisy colony "For" said he "I cannot hear when the French are coming for noise of these d d rooks" the time when the Church comparatively inert before she was roused to vigorous action by the rapid progress of dissent I and companion used to attend the old Parish Church a Sunday afternoon We frequently counted the congregation seldom found those present to exceed fifty yet this was the only church to found Huddersfield at that day When the completion of the fiftieth year of George the Third's reign came about there a grand jubilee national rejoicing In Huddersfield we got an illumination to assist in which many people stuck lighted candles in their windows with lumps of clay It will be in the recollection of many Huddersfield people that we had a central row of old buildings at the top part of Westgate which commonly called "top o' t' town" They have all now vanished John Liddle the shoemaker lived in one ef them He had been a recruiting sergeant in Huddersfield when he got his discharge he came to settle down amongst us little lower down stood the old Red Lion kept by Mrs Batley Lower down still lived Drocharty the clogger and at the bottom house lived David Hirst shoemaker This house stood nearly opposite the Plough Inn faced towards Westgate It was by people called Solomon's Temple from the following circumstance which I have heard my mother relate : — celebrated quack who went by the name of Doctor Solomon once lived in the house He sold nostrum which he called "Solomon's balm of Gilead" through the selling of it he amassed large fortune He afterwards left the town and in order he might be had in lasting remembrance people tho house he had lived "Solomon's Temple" New North Road was not existence The approach to Highfield Chapel by narrow lane through the fields whilst the Lane led from the chapel to Marsh My uncle the old Highfield Chapel or as it was then often called "Billy Moorhouse Chapel" I have my uncle's pew when I boy listening 'to the venerable old pastor the Reverend William Moorhouse with his white curly wig preaching from his pulpit After him came the Rev Doctor Boothroyd Dr Sizer the little veterinary surgeon will fresh in recollection many Huddersfield people I once heard him relate the following for the accuracy of which I will vouch though I see no reason for questioning it said that when boy there no cart road to Lockwood way of Chapel Hill The cart road to Lockwood by King's Mill and Spa Wood top or Crosland Moor and Swan Lane The river by foot-bridge beyond which there was footpath all the way to Lockwood When he other boys were bathing in the river the most daring amongst them to jump from The anecdote of firing the beacon on Castle Hill recalls incident in Sir Walter Scott's hovel "The Antiquary" many of our readers perhaps know the scene of the story is laid the east coast of Scotland The warder of the beacon deceived by bonfire lighted in Glenwithersliins at some distance from Fail-port sets fire to the pyre over he has charge The scene is thus described by novelist "Those have witnessed such a scene can alone conceive the of bustle in Fairport The windows were glancing with a hundred lights which appearing and disappearing rapidly indicated the confusion within doors The of lower rank assembled clamoured in the market place The yeomanry from their distant glens galloped through the streets some individually some in parties of five as they had met on the road -The drums and fifes of the volunteers beating to arms were blended with the voice of the officers the sound of the bugles and the tolling of the bells from the steepleB The in the harbour were lit up and boats from the armed vessels added to the bustle by landing destined for the defence of place three light already slipped their stood out sea in order to discover supposed enemy" This written the imeute Huddersfield took place It is quite possible Walter may have of- it note ' ' ‘ ' states similar s the deceived by fire in Northumberland the bridge into deep pool underneath to swim scramble to safer quarters best they could For present I have done hope my reminiscences have given much pleasure to others to read as they have given to me to write If it were advisable to tag on moral where the moral stands out so plainly should say that the history of Huddersfield -during the last seventy years shews the impossibility of standing still quiet village has become the prosperous centre of large manufacturing district with large public works splendid educational advantages and number of large and beautiful churches and chapels well attended and influentially supported The same sound is ringing through this seventy years as has rung through all the ages and that sound is "Progress progress progress"

1817

On the 9th of June, some hundreds of persons assembled about midnight, at a place adjoining the town of Huddersfield, called Folly Hall bridge, under a delusive expectation that they would be joined by other insurgents from various parts of the kingdom, and that, when united, their force would be sufficiently strong to overturn the government of the country! The approach of half a dozen yeomanry cavalry produced considerable alarm amongst them; but the mustered military ardour sufficient to fire several shots, and one of the cavalry horses was wounded in the head. The yeomanry, not considering it prudent to engage with so great a disparity of numbers, retreated for the purpose of obtaining a reinforcement, but, before they could return to the field, a panic had seized the motley assembly at the bridge, and, in a few minutes, their force was completely dispersed. Four and twenty persons, charged with having in some way participated in this futile enterprise, were subsequently apprehended and committed to York castle, and several others escaped. At the assizes in July, ten of the prisoners were put upon their trial before baron Wood, part of them charged with stealing fire arms on their Vv-ay to the place of rendezvous, and the remainder with aiding and abetting certain persons unknown, in firing at, with an intent to kill, maim, or disable Mr. David Alexander, the yeomanry cavalryman whose horse was shot in the head. Both the charges being ill-supported by evidence, all the prisoners put upon their trial were acquitted, and the bills presented against the principal part of the other prisoners were thrown out.

Jan. 20th. The prince regent opened parliament in person. In the latter part of this year, the armies of the allies were withdrawn from the French territories The riotous spirit which had lately displayed itself, broke out again on this occasion ; and the prince on his way to the house was assailed by tumultuous expressions of disapprobation from an unusually large concourse of people, whose conduct on the return of the procession became more violent, the royal carriage being attacked with stones and other missiles in an alarming manner ; a reward of £1,000 was offered for the apprehension of the offenders, but they were never discovered.

Feb. 7th. Lord Castlereagh announced in the House of Commons, that the prince regent, sympathising with the sufferings of a generous public, had determined to give up £50,000 per annum of his income; at the same time his lordship communicated the intention of ministers voluntarily to dispense with one-tenth of their official incomes; lord Camden, as one of the tellers of the exchequer, relinquished the whole of the enormous profits of that sinecure office, except £2,500, the regulated income of the other tellers; the expenditure of this year, on the reduced scale, was estimated at £6,500,000 less than that of the preceding one. This year Watson, Preston, Hooper, and Reene were committed to the tower for high treason; a reward of £500 was offered for the apprehension of Thistlewood, and a further reward of £500 for the junior Watson.

*Disturbances at Manchester.* At a public meeting held near St. Peter's church, on the 3rd of March, by persons denominating themselves friends of parliamentary reform, notices were issued that the espousers of their doctrines should assemble at the same place on the 10th, and proceed thence to the metropolis to present a petition to the prince regent, that they might be enabled to undeceive him. Accordingly on the appointed day, crowds of people flocked into the town from all directions; the instigators were mounted in a cart, and harangued the people, until their increasing numbers suggested the propriety of putting in force the civil and military powers. A party of dragoons, accompanied by the magistrates, surrounded the cart, and conveyed the entire group upon it to the New Bailey prison, and several others were seized by the soldiers on their way there. The concourse of auditors, which amounted to about 30,000, were forthwith dispersed, without the infliction of any severity. A considerable number set out on their mission to London, taking the route of Stockport; but about forty of them were reconducted to Manchester, and others were secured at Stockport. Most of them were provided with knapsacks, &c., containing blankets and other articles: not more than 500 penetrated so far as Macclesfield. Nothing could be more wretched than their appearance: some actually fainting through weariness, and all of them without provisions, or any apparent resource with which to proceed twenty miles further towards London. Thus ended what has since been known under the quaint appellation of the "Blanketeering Expedition."

June.

Watson, Thistlewood, and some others, were put on their trial, in the court of king's" bench, for high treason; but, chiefly from the discredit thrown upon the testimony of Castles, the principal witness and an accomplice or spy, they were acquitted. — In the course of the summer, the turbulent disposition of the manufacturing classes exhibited itself in many parts, by atrocious acts of tumult and outrage ; and it was found expedient to appoint a special commission, to sit at Derby to try the offenders. The first four prisoners who were tried were found guilty ; nineteen of the others were allowed to plead guilty, with an understanding that mercy would be extended to them, and twelve were acquitted; sentence of death was pronounced on twenty-three of these deluded men; and three of them, Brandreth, Ludlam, and Turner suffered the full penalty of the law.

MARSDEN MEMORIALS OF THE LUDDITES AND THE MURDER MR WILLIAM HORSFALL

CHAPTER I

The following information regarding the Luddites and the murder of Mr William Horsfall is not a collection of second-hand statements previously presented to the public in some form. It is given from a perfectly independent stand-point. The authorities are persons who lived at the time of the events narrated — men who were spectators of or actors in them— one of whom (the only living survivor) formed part of the mill garrison at Ottiwells, in Marsden, when an attack upon it was nightly expected. This account will possess a purely local character, making no pretension to describe Luddite deeds and outrages in other parts of the kingdom.

The Luddites, it may be necessary to inform a new generation, called themselves by that name after an imaginary General Lud, whose particular whereabouts was a mystery and whose existence was a myth; though the title of "General Lud" was sometimes given to one of the insurgents in this neighbourhood called George Mellor. Their avowed object was the destruction of the improved machinery intended to economise labour, including that recently introduced into the finishing of cloth, and which, to a considerable extent, supplanted manual labour. Like many misguided and ignorant men, before and since, they cherished the belief that they could to say to progress invention, "thus far shalt thou go and no further."

At the commencement of the century, woollen goods were finished by means of machines called shears, which were worked by hand — a man to each machine. The process was tedious and expensive; the machine itself was a ponderous, unsightly instrument somewhat resembling in form the shears used by shepherds in shearing their sheep, but square at the extremity of the blade. One blade was passed underneath the balk cloth to be finished, and the other over it; the latter cropping off the nap or wool, as the blades were pushed backwards and forwards by the workmen. The men engaged in this occupation were known by the name of Croppers.

Rightly or wrongly, they bore a sad character for being careless, devil-may-care men, fond of a spree, and reckless of control. There is a legend extant, which will perhaps throw some light upon the opinion entertained of them by their contemporaries, one of whom declared, that while they were very unfit for Paradise, they were too bad for the other quarter; so that there only remained purgatory for them as the alternative.

The tradition alluded to is, that in consequence of their dissipated and wicked ways, all the Croppers at their departure hence, went to certain place that — to describe it negatively — was neither purgatory, nor paradise; and that in the course of time they became so numerous in that particularly warm region, and withal so very, very unruly, that the Devil was at his wit's end what to do with them, and had no pleasure of his existence in their company. Get rid of them he could not. There they were, and notwithstanding all remonstrances, declared that they would neither depart, nor yet mend their manners. One day while pondering upon his difficult position, a brilliant idea suddenly occurred to his Satanic majesty. He knew the fondness of the Croppers when on earth, for ale, whether good, bad, or indifferent; so he went to the door of the infernal regions, and bawled out with all his might — "Ale! Ale! Ale." The effect was magical. At the joyful sound the Croppers were instantaneously seized with a burning thirst. They rushed out to a man helter-skelter, to where the delightful news came from. No sooner were they safely out, than Satan quietly but quickly slipped in, banging the door, and locking it after him, shouting through the keyhole to the astonished and deluded Croppers outside — "Now d——n you I have got you out, I'll keep you out, and 'lll take good care no more Croppers ever come in here!" And this is stated to be the reason — resting on ground, as authentic as many other received legends quite as true — that from thenceforth, no more Croppers entered the infernal regions.

Early in the century, a new frame and other improvements were added to the old fashioned hand shears, by means of which power could be applied to work them, in lieu of manual labour; and the result was, that by the improved system, one man could execute the work of three, and do it better. The use of the new machine became general throughout the manufacturing districts where finishing was carried on; and the Cropper, having a partiality for the ways their not overwise forefathers trod, became alarmed at the innovation, believing their craft to be in danger; and with other enemies to machinery, combined for the double purpose of checking its further adoption, and of destroying that already in operation. So the Luddites loomed into prominence as a very disturbing social element, dangerous to the peace and well-being of the community.

At this crisis, Enoch and James Taylor of Marsden, had commenced their career. Their workshop was in Brougham Road, then known as the Idle row, and their smithy or workshop occupied part of the present play ground of the Town School, which it is almost superfluous to state, had then no existence. They began life as blacksmiths in a very humble way, but being persevering men endowed with no little inventive genius, they became known as enterprising and skilful machine makers, and artisans.

There they commenced making the frames which became so hateful to the Luddites, and the adoption of which temporarily displaced more or less labour. The Taylors necessarily incurred no little odium, and their lives and property shared the risks to which all persons were liable who became obnoxious to the Luddites. In those days, a large hammer used by mechanics was known by the name of "Enoch," and when the Luddites commenced the destruction of the finishing frames with them, they had a saying — referring to the Christian name of the senior Taylor — "Enoch made them, and Enoch shall break them."

These improved frames were introduced at Woodbottom Mill then belonging to the Brothers Armitage, Joseph, Enoch, and David; and also at Ottiwells, then the property of Abraham and John Horsfall, who also owned the mills at Bankbottom. The first frame that came to Ottiwells was a wooden made in Slaithwaite; and for a time the Horsfalls had one or two at work at the mill in Fall-lane. The new machinery was also introduced into dwelling-houses, as the frame could be adapted to hand labour; and in 1812, when the Luddite disturbances were at their height, several of these machines were at work in various dwellings in the neighbourhood of Marsden. These were destroyed by the rioters, and the owners put in bodily danger. After trying their destructive powers on a small scale, the Luddites announced their intention to make short work of those at the several mills; and the frames at Woodbottom and Ottiwells were marked out for destruction, and the lives of their owners threatened.

The Armitages and the Horsfalls took prompt and energetic measures for the protection of their property. A bridge over the river at the Woodbottom Mill had an iron gate placed across the centre which could be securely fastened against all invaders. It had iron spikes at the top, and a row of iron spikes down each side. This bridge — with its gateway and protecting spikes — remained in its original integrity until a very recent day.

At Ottiwells, at the upper end of the road fronting the mill, and on an elevation level with the present dam, a cannon was planted behind a wall pierced with openings three feet high and ten inches wide. Through these apertures, the cannon could be pointed so as to command the entire frontage of the mill, and fired upon an approaching enemy. This somewhat primitive battery still exists, but the artillery disappeared long ago; and though now walled up, the outlines of the embrasures formerly left for the cannon to be discharged through may yet be distinctly discerned.

In addition to these means of defence, the workmen employed at the mills were armed, and kept watch and ward in turns during the night; and it deserves to be recorded to the honour of the Marsden croppers, and of the Marsden labouring men as a class, that during these eventful and disaffected times, none of them were known to be guilty of complicity with, or of manifesting sympathy for, the Luddites or their unlawful designs. A considerable body of military were sent, and stationed in the village to guard the mills from attack — to protect life and property — and to put down any insurrectionary movement; and as an additional precautionary measure, the inhabitants of Marsden and the surrounding villages were compelled to deliver up to lawfully appointed authorities all firearms in their possession, which were again returned to the owners, when the temporary reign of terror had passed away.

MARSDEN MEMORIALS OF THE LUDDITES AND THE MURDER OF MR WILLIAM HORSFALL

CHAPTER II

The military sent to protect life and property in Marsden comprised both infantry and cavalry; the latter consisting at various times of the 10th King's Bays, the 15th Hussars, and the Scotch Greys. The same men did not remain for any lengthened period in the neighbourhood, one alleged reason for speedy change being the fear of the authorities, lest they should become indoctrinated with the seditious opinions of the Luddites. The soldiers met every evening where the present Market place is now; and after a few evolutions were told off in two divisions, one proceeding in the direction of Ottiwells and Puleside, and the other to Woodbottom mill and Lingards; patrolling to and from the different points throughout the night. They were quartered at the several Inns, in or near the village; and the renumeration allowed by the Government for their maintenance was so inadequate, that the innkeepers were impoverished, and in some instances ruined; and thus had reason to regard the advent of the soldiery, pecuniarily, as anything but a Godsend. Men then, and still living, declare, that these soldiers when off duty were dissipated and licentious, and a terror to the peaceably disposed; and that they exercised a present, and left a lasting influence for evil upon the morals and the manners of the people.

At this distance of time, when the prejudices and the fears of that day have passed away, we are in a position to write dispassionately and free from personal bias or feeling, of the men and events of that time. We will give the character as limned by those who had opportunities of knowing them, of two Marsden notabilities who stood forward as prominent and marked men. The first of the two, Mr William Horsfall, was in person a good specimen of an Englishman, with many of an Englishman's traditionary, and characteristic virtues and foibles. At the time of his death he was in the full flush of a vigorous manhood, being about 40 years of age. He is described as an excitable man, of strong likes and dislikes, of great apparent resolution, but with an innate shrinking from serious danger. Thus it is related, that notwithstanding his outspoken language and his defiant tone towards the Luddites, he signified to his neighbours the Armitages, his willingness so far to succumb to the threats of the insurgents, as to pull down his own obnoxious frames, if they would do so likewise; but the suggestion met with no favour. Mr Horsfall, like many persons of impetuous disposition, when the tempest of his anger had spent itself, passed to the other extreme, and would overwhelm the ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? with favour. As an employer, he was much liked by his workmen, and a pugnacious exterior covered a naturally kind and forgiving disposition; but towards the Luddites he displayed an implacable spirit, and his words were rash and threatening. As he journeyed on horseback along Lingards wood, the children would cry out he passed "My name is General Lud;" and he would ride after the urchins to give them a blow with his whip. In his angry moments he declared his willingness to ride up to the saddle girths in the blood of the Luddites; and it is probable, that it was more or less owing to such intemperate expressions that the Luddites in a spirit of wild and fiendish revenge, singled him out specially for destruction.

Mr Joseph Armitage, the senior partner of the firm at Woodbottom, was a man of another type. He was less demonstrative than Mr Horsfall, but possessed more firmness and tenacity — one who once convinced of the wisdom of a certain line of conduct, followed it out to the end, whatsoever dangers stood in the way. He defied, not so much by speech as in action, the machinations of the malcontents; and when upon the murder of Mr Horsfall, the shears at Ottiwells were taken to pieces by the owners, and the old system of working by hand resumed, he continued to dare all risks and kept his own at work, until supplanted by machines of an improved construction. Then and afterwards, he stubbornly resisted espionage, and interference from without, and the hateful tyranny of trades unions. For his generation, he was a man of more than ordinary intelligence — of superior culture, and considerable force of will. His commercial career during the first half of the century was an epitome of the progress of the woollen trade — its revolutions, its changes, and its wonderful development. On all social, public, and political questions he was abreast of the times; and the supporter of civil and religious freedom, when its friends were few. He died in January 1856, at the advanced age of 81 years.

When the Luddites had resolved to advance from the breaking of single frames to their wholesale destruction, and from that to the assassination of the owners; two mills were singled out as fitting objects for vengeance, the destruction of which it was supposed would cause the employers of the improved machinery to discontinue its use. One of these mills was that of Mr. Cartwright's, at Rawfolds; and the other, that of Messrs. Horsfall at Marsden. There is a tradition extant, that the rioters decided by the throwing up of a coin which should be attacked first. Fortune declared for Mr Cartwright's mill; and on the 11th of April, 1812, a most determined and murderous assault was made upon it. The defence was even more plucky and resolute, the rioters being sigually defeated with the loss of life; and what to them as insurgents was of no less importance, with the loss of prestige.

Thus repulsed the Luddites determined upon a desperate act, in order to strike terror into those employers obnoxious to them. A resolution, which was from being kept secret, was formed to assassinate Mr Horsfall, as a representative man, and their most hated enemy; and its execution followed quickly upon their ignominious defeat at Rawfolds.

The time chosen for the commission of the crime was an extraordinary one. It was on a market day, and at that particular hour of the day when the tradesmen and country people were returning homewards from Huddersfield in one almost continuous stream, on a highway which was the principal thoroughfare of a populous district. It was broad daylight, before the sun had gone down. Time and place appear to have been chosen with perfect callousness as to ultimate consequences; and as if such a result as discovery and death had never entered into the calculations of the murderers. It seems all but inexplicable, that the discovery and capture of the assassins under such circumstances, should have been delayed for even a single hour.

On Tuesday, the 28th April, 1812, Mr Horsfall according to custom attended Huddersfield market. He left that town on his return homewards between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, calling at the old "Warren House Inn," at Crosland Moor; then kept by a landlord named Joseph Armitage. Here he obtained some refreshment, without however alighting from his horse; and recognising two men who were there, he treated each of them to a glass of liquor. He then proceeded on his journey by the then highway to Manchester, which still passes by Holthead, and Hey-heads in Marsden — the present turnpike through Slaithwaite, not being made. When about a quarter of a mile from the "Warren House," near a plantation, a pistol, heavily loaded, was deliberately levelled and fired at him. The shot took deadly effect, two or more balls entering Mr Horsfall's left side. A person named Henry Parr on his way to Marsden, heard the report, saw the smoke of the pistol, and observed four men at the corner of the plantation. Instantly a horse and its rider, hitherto preceding him, turned round towards him. The rider called out "Murder," and fell with his face forward upon the horse's neck. Parr recognised him at once, and Mr. Horsfall exclaimed, "Good man, I am shot." The alarm was given, people were speedily on the spot, and Mr Horsfall was conveyed senseless and bleeding to the "Warren House," where he remained till his death on the day but one following. A solitary labourer at work in the adjacent fields saw the murder perpetrated. He was seized with speechless terror and ran as if for bare life across the fields; leaving the victim to his fate, and the assassins to their momentary triumph.

One of Mr. Horsfall's most valued friends was Mr. Edmund Eastwood, then living at Slaithwaite, in the house where his nephew, Mr John Farrar, now resides. Mr Horsfall was in the habit of occasionally attending Slaithwaite church, and of calling upon Mr. Eastwood, who, as an intimate friend and well wisher, frequently expostulated with Mr Horsfall on the impolicy of his language regarding the Luddites, as rendering himself unnecessarily obnoxious to them. On the day of the murder, Mr. Eastwood attended Huddersfield market. In the afternoon he left the "Pack Horse" where he stopped, and went to "The George" which was Mr Horsfall's hotel, to call upon the latter; that they might return home together, partly for companionship, partly for protection. Mr. Eastwood however found that Mr. Horsfall had just departed for Marsden, and he started quickly after him in order to overtake him. As he approached "The Warren House," he saw a man coming towards him supporting the bleeding, and apparently lifeless body of Mr. Horsfall. The horror stricken friend without waiting for reply to his hurried inquiry as to what had occurred, intuitively divined the character of the calamity; and instantly turned his horse in the direction of Huddersfield, riding with hot haste for medical assistance. Buxton road not then in existence as a thoroughfare, the entrance into Huddersfield at that extremity being up Outcote Bank. Along this route Mr. Eastwood quickly rode; turning the corner too abruptly at the "White Hart Inn," his horse stumbled and fell. The rider fell beneath his horse, sustaining injuries which ultimately proved fatal; and thus his friend's tragic fate, was the cause of his own untimely end.

MARSDEN MEMORIALS OF THE LUDDITES AND THE MURDER OF MR WILLIAM HORSFALL

`[Since the first portions of these memorials respecting the Luddites were written, we have had placed in our hands a "Report of proceedings at York Special Commission, January, 1813," where the Luddites were tried, "from the short hand notes of Mr. Gurney;" also, another report of the same proceedings printed by Edward Baines at the "Mercury" office, Leeds, in 1813. When necessary, we have availed ourselves of the facts contained in these reports. These two reports were re-printed in 1862, by John Cowgill, of Huddersfield, together with other Luddite trials, and issued in a neat form at the moderate price of one shilling.]`

CHAPTER III

Of the four men observed escaping from the spot, but not recognised at the time of the murder (as described in the last chapter), two of them, George Mellor and William Thorpe, were only 22 years of age, Thomas Smith only 23, and Benjamin Walker, 25. They were all four concerned in the attack upon Mr Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds. They were young, rash men, Mellor being the most resolute and reckless, and the virtual leader of the rest; all bore an intense hatred towards shear frames and their owners; and instead of the failure upon Cartwright's mill having a tendency to bring them to a better state of mind, and serve as a check upon their mad designs, it appears to have exercised a contrary influence, prompting them to still more desperate deeds.

Mellor and Smith worked as croppers at the mill of a Mr. Wood at Longroyd-bridge. Thorpe worked at the mill of a Mr. Fisher, very near Wood's. After the failure of the attack at Rawfolds, these men coolly discussed the plan of future proceedings, in the most undisguised manner, with their companions, and announced their settled resolve take the life of Mr. Horsfall. The fourth assassin, named Benjamin Walker, employed at the same mill as Mellor and Smith, was taken into their confidence, acquainted with all their plans and designs, and was as guilty as the most culpable. After the murder, in order to save his own life, and probably to gain the reward offered for the discovery of the assassins, Walker turned approver against, and betrayed his partners in crime, thus obtaining His Majesty's pardon. It was in a great degree owing to his evidence, that his companions were convicted and hanged.

Men initiated into the ranks of the Luddites were bound to secrecy and faithfulness by a fearful oath. The open manner in which the murder of Mr. Horsfall was talked about and deliberately planned amongst the brotherhood, can only be accounted for on the assumption, that the infatuated men believed themselves perfectly safe from the possibility of betrayal by men, who had taken an oath, the breaking of which it was assumed would be followed by sure and speedy death to the traitor. The oath was as follows:—

> I, ——————, of my own voluntary will, do declare and solemnly swear that I never will reveal to any person or persons under the canopy of heaven, the names of the persons who compose this secret committee, their proceedings, meetings, places of abode, dress, features, connexions, or else that might lead to a discovery of the same either by word, or deed, or sign, under the penalty of being sent out of the world by the first brother who shall meet me, and my name and character blotted out of existence, and never to be remembered but with contempt and abhorrence; and I further now do swear, that I will use my best endeavours to punish by death any traitor or traitors should any rise up amongst us, wherever I can find him or them; and though he should fly to the verge of naturem I will pursue him with unceasing vengeance. So help me God, and bless me to keep this my oath inviolable."

George Mellor had been in Russia, and on his return to England had brought a large pistol with him of a peculiar kind. He afterwards disposed of it, and it changed hands more than once. Mellor, however, previous to the murder, knowing in whose possession this pistol was, borrowed it of its owner, William Hall, in whose house, on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 28th April, in the presence of Hall himself, he loaded it. He put two pipe heads full of powder in the barrel, then a ball, next some slugs, consisting of flattened balls, putting another ball on the top of these, and ramming the whole firmly down; coolly declaring "he meant to give Horsfall that." Mellor then returned to his work at the mill, being there by five o'clock, and going up to Benjamin Walker, put the loaded pistol into his hand, telling him that he must go with him to shoot Horsfall. Walker examined the pistol, saw that it was charged, and said he would accompany Mellor. The other two accomplices, Smith and Thorpe, were present at the time, and Mellor ordered Smith and Walker to proceed there and then to Mr. Radcliffe's plantation, near "The Warren House." Smith had a pistol with him which he had bought and repaired for the occasion, and he shewed it to Walker to let him see that it was loaded.

These two men had been at the plantation some ten minutes before Mellor and Thrope joined them, each of the four men at this time being provided with a pistol. It would seem from the testimony of Walker the informer, that while waiting for their companions, he and Smith had some misgivings as to the wisdom of their wicked design, and resolved to make an attempt to dissuade Mellor and Thorpe from proceeding any further with their project; but in reply to such remonstrances the two latter declared they would shoot them too, if they attempted to leave them. Mellor and Thorpe stood at the corner of the plantation nearest "The Warren House," and Smith and Walker were ordered to proceed a distance of twenty yards farther on, that they might fire after the first pistols been discharged by their companions. Mellor was to give the signal, when he saw Horsfall approaching, by whistling. These arrangements were barely made, when Mellor exclaimed— "he is coming." Immediately, Mellor and his companion fired their pistols with deadly accuracy; the two companions Walker and Smith, instead of waiting according previous arrangement to see whether the first shots had taken effect or not, and firing their own pistols, were seized with terror and ran away in the wood, where they were speedily joined by Mellor and Thorpe. Mellor damned them for cowards, and told them they ought to have fired too, whether Horsfall had been hit or not by the first shots. They then ran over some fields to Dungeon Wood, where they separated; Smith and Walker concealing their pistols in some anthills in the wood, where the weapons were subsequently discovered. Walker and his accomplice Smith, then went to a public house at Honley and had several pints of ale. While there some men called and brought an account of the murder of Mr. Horsfall, to which the murderers seemed to listen with the utmost unconcern. Smith who was a famous whistler commenced whistling a tune for the amusement of the company, to which a drunken collier made a drunken effort to dance. The other two accomplices, Mellor and Thorpe, after leaving their companions, went to the house of a cousin of Mellor's named Joseph Mellor. Here Mellor asked for a handkerchief for himself and for water for his comrade to wash himself with; both changed portions of their clothing, and gave an apprentice two pistols into his hands for a few minutes, which the prisoners afterwards in his presence, put under some flocks for concealment, and where the same night the occupier of the house, on the information of the apprentice found them, and carried them into the laith. It would seem that after these occurrences, all the murderers returned to their several dwellings sometime during the same evening.

"Horsfall of Marsden is shot by the Luddites!" Such were the words passed from man to man, and from dwelling to dwelling with almost lightning rapidity in and around Huddersfield that night, filling men's minds with a vague fear of coming calamity. The intelligence reached Marsden quickly, and the words "Horsfall is shot," were on every tongue. The tradespeople returning from market conveyed the news far and wide as they journeyed homewards. Men and women in startled groups repeated the tale to each other. The very children perceived that some dire event had happened, and believed that the dreaded, and long foretold Luddites, were really coming at last. The news quickly entered the loneliest and remotest cottage in Marsden; and the effect was that of consternation or joy, according to the fears, the hopes, or the sympathies of the listener. The Luddites for the moment believed their hour of triumph had arrived, and that the first earnest and decisive blow had at length been struck, the precursor of the destruction of the detested machinery, and of its no less detested owners.

At Marsden, on the receipt of the intelligence, the authorities undismayed, prepared for all emergencies and redoubled their precautions. The head quarters of cavalry were at the house now belonging to Mr. Robert Taylor. It was then the principal Inn in the village and known as "The Old Red Lion," kept by a landlord named John Race. The large room still extending over the entire building — now applied to a far different purpose — was converted into barracks for the cavalry, their horses being kept in the adjoining stables. At Ottiwells, where a portion of the infantry was continually on guard during the night, prompt measures against a probable attack were taken. Watch and ward was maintained by the soldiery and the local constabulary; a strict surveillance was kept over all suspected individuals; and no lights were permitted in dwellings after nine o'clock in the evening.

It was naturally anticipated that Woodbottom mill and its proprietors would be the next objects of vengeance, and preparations were made to frustrate it. For months past, Enoch and James Taylor slept in the mill in consequence of their lives being threatened, and their own dwellings being unsafe, and they formed part of the mill garrison at night. Their future partner Arthur Hirst, was the woollen engineer at the mill, and he vigorously laboured to convert the factory into a fortified place, becoming for the time a military engineer. The windows of the first story were barricaded. The doors and shutters were coated inside with sheet iron. All communication between the first and upper storeys could be cut off; and the defenders inside were enabled to fire upon an attacking force from the upper storeys while sheltered themselves. A trap door on a floor over the water wheel had been so ingeniously planned by Arthur Hirst, that if the rioters had gained an entrance they would on touching the flooring drop through it into the wheel race below where they could hurt nobody but themselves; while the application of water to the wheel, would have made their unexpected prison house exceedingly unpleasant quarters.

Thus matters on the evening of this 28th April, 1812. The victim lay dying — the murderers returned to their homes enjoying temporary immunity from discovery in the first mad flush of their short triumph — and the threatened men in Marsden, sternly and bravely set their houses in order, and prepared for the worst.

MARSDEN MEMORIALS OF THE LUDDITES AND THE MURDER OF MR WILLIAM HORSFALL

CHAPTER IV

At this distance of time it appears strange to us — and it is a proof how well the secrets of the Luddites were kept — that for months after the assassination of Mr. Horsfall the murderers remained at large. They went in and out amongst their fellow workmen, and pursued their customary avocations as usual; while numbers of persons must have known they were the very men for whose discovery and conviction all possible measures were being taken, and the large reward of £2,000 offered for their apprehension. Yet no discovery took place until one of the accomplices, Benjamin Walker, either through fear, or an expectation of securing the proffered reward, or from both motives combined, turned informer against his companions in guilt, and was admitted evidence for the Crown. Thus all impediments which had hitherto frustrated the ends of justice, were swept away.

To avoid unnecessary prolixity it may be briefly stated, that a Special Commission was held at York for the trial of the Luddites, 64 in number, who were concerned in the disturbances in the West Riding. The Assizes commenced on Saturday Jan. 2nd, 1813, and terminated on the 12th of the same month. Amongst the prisoners were three of the murderers of Mr. Horsfall, namely, George Mellor, William Thorpe, and Thomas Smith.

The evidence against them was conclusive, the testimony of the accomplice and informer Walker, and other witnesses, sealing their guilt beyond the possibility of doubt. The prisoners were defended by Henry, now Lord Brougham, and at that day it was a peculiarity of the law in trials for such crimes as the prisoners were charged with, that while their counsel could cross-examine the witnesses for the Crown, and examine the witnesses for the defence, they could not address the jury on behalf of the accused. This injustice no longer exists.

Mr Justice LeBlanc the presiding Judge summed up the evidence clearly and impartially, but in a manner that to the Jury, must have made the guilt of the prisoners appear unquestionable. At the close of the summing up the jury retired, and returned in twenty-five minutes, bringing in a verdict of "Guilty " against all the prisoners; who upon being asked if they had anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon them, severally declared, that they were "Not Guilty"; Thorpe adding — "evidence has been given false against me, that I declare." Before and after the conviction an impression, possessed many minds, that Smith was not as culpable as the rest, and that he was as much sinned against as sinning. This feeling was strengthened by fact, that the Jury singled him out from the rest, and the day before the execution, recommended him to mercy; but the recommendation was disregarded.

The trial concluded on Wednesday the 6th of Jan. In those death followed quickly upon conviction, and on the Friday following, the execution of the three men took place at York.

In the short interval between conviction and execution the prisoners were very penitent, yet persistently refused to make any acknowledgment of their guilt. Mellor declared "that he would rather be in the situation he was then placed in, dreadful as it was, than have to answer for the crime of their accuser (Walker);" adding that "he would not change places with him for his liberty and two thousand pounds."

To prevent the possibility of rescue the place of execution was guarded by a strong force of cavalry and infantry, and at nine o'clock in the morning, in the presence of a vast assemblage of people, the murderers met their doom. Though deeply affected they passed, without making any confession of their guilt, into the Land of Shadows. On the Saturday but one following, fourteen more persons were executed at York for crimes of a similar character; a wholesale execution which has since had no parallel in this country.

The informer's usual fate pursued Walker, who to crime had added treachery. Justice sometimes requires such means for the detection of crime, but they are vile instruments. The Crown pardoned the informer and self convicted murderer, but public opinion branded him as equally criminal with those who had suffered for their crime; and a belief more or less prevailed that he had in some degree sworn falsely. A Nemesis tracks such men, and it pursued Walker. His fellow men shunned him — nothing prospered with him — his hands were stained with blood — and in his old age, he applied for parish relief to the Huddersfield Board of Guardians.

As previously described, after the murder of Mr. Horsfall, preparations were made at Marsden against a probable attack upon life and property. But no attack took place. With the murder of Mr. Horsfall the crisis had attained its height, and the tide of insurrection began to ebb. The Luddites lacking leaders and a settled plan, seemed at a loss what to do next; while the energetic measures of the local authorities and the vigorous action of the government, converted triumphant criminals into skulking cowards. Law and order gained the ascendancy once more.

The members of the firm of Messrs. Abraham and John Horsfall took the death of their nephew greatly to heart; and the father, Mr. Abraham Horsfall, from thenceforth appeared to imbibe a dislike to Marsden. The use of the obnoxious machinery was discontinued at Ottiwells, and cropping by hand resumed; and in a few years afterwards their mill property in Marsden was disposed of, Bankbotton mills passing into the possession of Messrs. Norris, Sykes, and Priestley; and Ottiwells to Messrs. Abraham and William Kinder. It is related that after his son's death, Mr. Horsfall never again entered the mill at Ottiwells, and that when riding past on his way to Bankbottom, he invariably averted his face from the mill, as if its very sight was hateful and painful to him.

It may be interesting to many of a new generation to make a passing observation on the social condition of the people at that time. Though there was considerable suffering in some parts of the kingdom, partly owing to the changes produced by the introduction of improved machinery, yet absolute privation and want of employment could not be alleged as an excuse for the Luddite disturbances in the West Riding, so far the croppers more especially were concerned. In their case, they were amongst the best remunerated, and best employed of the labouring classes, their average wages being twenty-four shillings per week. In other branches of labour in this locality work was plentiful. The future wonderful cotton trade was then becoming of great importance, and warp and weft ready for the hand-loom were brought to Marsden from Lancashire fortnightly, and put out to Marsden weavers, who, as times went, were enabled to earn good wages. But by the side of this state of things must be placed the fact, that in consequence of war, defective harvests, commercial restrictions, and a depreciated currency, provisions and clothing were at an enormous price, and of an indifferent quality. These were "the good old times" that innocent old women know nothing concerning them, rave about, as being an imaginary paradise. If they lived in such times now they would miss their tea and other little creature comforts with a vengeance, and sing less about "the ways their wise forefathers trod," when civil and religious disabilities, and trade monopolies, enslaved the intellect, the conscience, the commerce, and the energies of the nation. Flour at that epoch was 6d per lb.; meal, five guineas per pack; candles, 1s 1d per lb.; mutton, 11d.; clothing was more than proportionately dear, and the every day necessaries of life of our own day were almost unknown luxuries. The most prosperous lived sparingly, or, as we should now think, poorly and almost meanly. The young seldom tasted wheaten bread except as a special treat on a Sunday, and tea and coffee were almost unknown. The latter were more than double their present price, while the sandiest of sandy sugar to sweeten them with, cost 11d. per lb. The ordinary staff of life consisted of substantial porridge, served out daily with but little variation for breakfast, dinner, and supper.

The introduction of the new and obnoxious finishing machinery was almost, if not entirely, the result of necessity on the part of the employers. The croppers were amongst the best remunerated workmen of the day. Like many men before and since, they did not know when they were doing well, and former combinations to limit the number of workmen in their own branch of industry, and oppose all improvements that would economise work. It is the old, old tale of Trades Unions over again. In self defence, men set their wits to work to discover modes of rendering themselves independent of such interference and domination, and were successful. Then ensued the struggle between the adherents of the "old ways" and the adopters of the new inventions, with the inevitable ultimate result. Despite all ebbs and flows — despite all combination and opposition — despite intimidation even assassination, the thoughts, the actions, and the plans of men then as now, were "widened with the process of the suns;" and the Luddites in their day and generation were but the type of other classes — some even yet in existence — who would say to human skill, and enterprise, and invention, and free inquiry — "Thus far shall ye go, but no further."

Thus a dark chapter in the social and industrial history of this district came to be acted and written. It is a sad picture and a melancholy record of man's ignorance of human crime, and reckless vengeance, followed by just and speedy retribution. It remains for all posterity, a lesson and a warning.

Huddersfield and Holmfirth Examiner - Saturday 23 August 1890

In a communication respecting the Luddites to Notes and Queries (7th s. x. 90) by the Rev. John Pickford, and which was reprinted in the *Leeds Mercury Supplement*, the other day, it is stated that "an interesting account of the rioters, and of the murder of Mr. Abraham Horsfall, who was shot by the Luddites, April 28th, 1812 ... may be found in "Old Stories Retold", by Walter Thornbury, p.p. 157, 73. This statement is not correct. It was Mr. William Horsfall who was shot, and not Abraham. The victim had a brother, the Rev. Abraham Horsfall, who was for some years the incumbent of Marsden. What I wish here to point out is that the "interesting account" mentioned as being given in "Old Stories Retold", by Walter Thornbury, was taken almost word for word from a series of capital articles, entitled "Of the Luddites, and the Murder of Mr. William Horsfall," being given in the *Huddersfield Examiner* about thirty years ago, and were written by Mr. (now County Alderman) J. B. Robinson, of Marsden.

The manner in which these articles got to Mr. Thornbury was rather strange, and I may at another time tell how he came by them. His sole acknowledgment was to place quotation marks before and after one of his many excerpts, with the slight intimation, "A local correspondent says." I understand that a good many of Mr. Robinson's able paragraphs have been utilised elsewhere, but in few instances has there been full and honourable recognition of the source whence they were derived.

ON THE BAT'S BACK

...

In the month of August last, I referred in this column to a communication respecting the "Luddites," which was copied in from "Notes and Queries" into the *Leeds Mercury*. The excerpt was entitled "an interesting account of the rioters, and of the murder of Mr. Abraham Horsfall, of Marsden," taken from "Old stories re-told" by Walther Thornbury. I then pointed out that the "interesting account, &c." had been "lifted" without anything like due acknowledgement from the pages of the *Examiner*, and that the author of the "interesting account" was not Mr Thornbury, but Mr. (now County Alderman) J. B. Robinson, of Marsden. The readers of the *Examiner* for the past thirty years will need no reminding of the many interesting and valuable contributions which have appeared in the columns of this paper from the pen of Mr. J. B. Robinson. During the period a great number of Mr Robinson's articles have been utilised elsewhere, but in few instances has there been any acknowledgement of the source from whence they had been derived.

It is well known that for a great number of years Mr. Robinson has been a close student of local history, more especially in connection with Marsden and neighbourhood, and has collated a great number of interesting facts and information on the subject of "The Luddites," "Marsden Church and its Graveyard," "Marsden Black Flood," "The Poaching Days and Ways," "Famous Marsden Oratorios," and other interesting subjects. Much of this information was embodied in the articles to which I have referred. At the repeated request of a great number of friends Mr. Robinson, I am happy to say, has decided to collect a number of these articles and publish them in book form, with notes and additions. Personally, I am very glad that Mr. Robinson has come to this decision, and it gives me much pleasure to have the honour of being the first to make it known on "The Bat's Back."

Huddersfield and Holmfirth Examiner - Saturday 07 March 1891

A Holmfirth correspondent writes to, reminds me that, so far back as August 22 last year, I promised to relate how "The Story of the Luddites", by Mr. J. B. Robinson, of Marsden, came into the hands of Mr. Walter Thornbury, who, it will be remembered, utilised Mr. Robinson's articles in his book called, "Old Stories Re-told." I hasten to repair my omission. The "Luddite" papers were contributed to the *Examiner* by Mr. (now County Alderman) J. B. Robinson, in the "sixties," and soon after they were finished Mr. Woodhead, the proprietor of the *Examiner*, was in London, and met Mr. Wills, who was then acting-editor for Dickens's *All the Year Round*. The Luddites were mentioned, and Mr. Woodhead stated that some articles had just appeared in the *Examiner* respecting them. At Mr. Wills's request Mr. Woodhead forwarded the numbers of the *Examiner* in which the narrative appeared. These were, apparently, handed to Mr. Thornbury, who was then on Dickens's staff, and he wrote an article on the subject for *All the Year Round*, borrowing literally and liberally from Mr. Robinson's papers. His sole acknowledgment was to place quotation marks before and after *one* of his
many excerpts, with the slight intimation "A local correspondent says." Mr. Thornbury afterwards "lifted" the articles bodily into his book "Old Stories Re-told."

The same well-told story of the Luddites also appeared in "The Casquet of Literature," 1873,
published by Blackie and Son, and was again accredited to Mr. Thornbury. Soon after Mr. Thornbury's article appeared Mr. Robinson happened to call at a warehouse in Huddersfield—"The Atlantic Buildings"—when the manager began to give him an account of an article which had appeared in the *Leeds Times* on the Saturday previous, about the "Luddites and the murder of Mr. Horsfall," and he related as a very amusing anecdote that about the "Croppers," and the reason there are none in a certain place never mentioned to ears polite. At this Mr. Robinson began to prick up his ears, for, as he says, "it sounded remarkably like my own thunder,"
which, of course, it proved to be, the *Leeds Times* having copied it from *All the Year Round*.

I venture to remind my younger readers who happen to be interested in the "Luddites," that the
author, Mr. J. B. Robinson, intends to include this story in his forthcoming volume of "Marsden
Memorials," which will also contain a vast amount of interesting and valuable information concerning Marsden and neighbourhood.

So Holmfirth is a "picturesque and romantic village"? Mr. James Burnley thus describes it in his volume of "Yorkshire Stories Retold."
...

Mr Burnley told tale of Luddite riots in his volume, so that Colne Valley need not be feeling jealous of the historic position of its neighbour. If Marsden has any feeling of envy because Holmfirth was termed "picturesque and romantic," that feeling may be dismissed in view of the fact that Marsden supplied, in the person of Mr. Horsfall, the victim of the tragedy which took place at Crosland Moor, and in view also of the world-wide celebrity which it has since achieved as the abode of Dinah Midge, waiting with her tub of hot water for the tithe-proctor.

The Luddites (7th S. ix. 485; x. 16).—A very interesting account of the Luddite rioters, and of the murder of Mr. Abraham Horsfall, who was shot by them April 28, 1812, on the Huddersfield road, may be found in ‘Old Stories Retold,' by Walter Thornbury, pp. 157-72. It records a black and gloomy page in the history of England. The object of the Luddites was to destroy the new frames and machinery introduced for the purpose of finishing woollen materials, and thereby doing away with much manual labour. By an Act of Parliament which was in 1812, and which continued in force until 1814, frame-breaking was made a capital offence. Amongst the most active magistrates who took a leading part in suppressing the riots were Col. Hulton, the Rev. W. Hey, Vicar of Rochdale and also of Ackworth, near Pontefract, and Mr. Joseph Radcliffe, (formerly Pickford), of Milnes Bridge House. The last-named gentleman was created a baronet by Lord Sidmouth in 1813, with the singular honour of a gratuitous patent, in testimony of his courageous services in those turbulent times. There is a fine portrait of him by William Owen in the Court House at Huddersfield, which has been well engraved by Heath, having his favourite dog lying at his feet. Sir Joseph died in 1819. He assumed the name and arms of Radcliffe in compliance with the will of his maternal uncle, William Radcliffe.

ON THE BAT'S BACK

Controversy over the effects of improvement of machinery so as to make it more efficient seems never to be ended. Each time an improvement that displaces labour temporarily is made, there is an outcry— which in one sense is not to be wondered at, but in another is remarkable. I see, from reading two letters in the *Daily Examiner*, "Wood Top" has been renewing the controversy in our midst, and Mr. Schofield has only partly answered him. I am not a partisan, only a sprite, so I do not enter into the controversy on either side. I can, however, add to the material by which disputants can fortify themselves, and tell what others have said in past days upon one subject or another, and in this case the material comes from the book which I have mentioned lately—the report of the Luddite trials.

The writer of the introduction from which I quoted last week says on the point raised by "Wood Top:"—"The events of the last year prove that it may be altogether superfluous to show how it is that the improvement of machinery is beneficial, instead of being detrimental, to the interests of the labouring manufacturer, as well as to the community at large. It is obvious that the demand for any commodity increases with its cheapness, and that the purchaser will resort to the market at which it is sold at the lowest rate; and, therefore, that every thing which contributes to the cheapness increases the demand, and gives an advantage to the market where such cheapness exists over all other markets where, from local causes, the commodity cannot be sold at so low a price. Where the demand increases the number of hands employed will increase also. But nothing has ever been found to contribute so much to the cheapness of a manufactured article as the use of machinery, which enables the same work to be done, not only in less time and with fewer hands, but by persons of earlier age and of less robust constitutions than can render themselves useful while all the operations are to be performed by bodily strength. Hence all the members of a family are now enabled to contribute towards its support, instead of relying (as formerly was the case) altogether upon the exertions of the husband and father, who still has many parts of the manufacture to which he may apply his vigour, and earn ample wages. What then would be the consequence if the endeavours of the disaffected could succeed in the expulsion of machinery? The wife and the young children would be thrown out of employment; the husband and the father must support them entirely by his own labour; the price of the manufactured goods would be raised, the purchaser would resort to a cheaper market, where the use of machinery would gradually disarm his journeymen, or reduce their wages; while their families would become more and more burthensome, and finally, nothing but poverty and misery would prevail."

I notice also that the point was raised by counsel in the trial of the Luddites who attacked Cartwright's mill. Mr. Park, counsel for the Crown, said:— "It is well known that in the manufacturing part of the West Riding of this county, there have been implements of machinery introduced, and wisely introduced, for the purpose of expediting our manufactures, and bringing them into better use. The advantages to the labourers themselves, if they would have given themselves the patience to understand them, would have convinced them of the great utility of such machinery; but unfortunately they took a different course, and would not stay to consider the great mischiefs they would bring on themselves, not only if punishment followed, but the absolute poverty, misery, and distress which the destruction of those mills, where such machinery was used, must bring on all the unfortunate persons who were occupied in them. If they had so considered, I think that common prudence, independent of moral obligation, would have prevented their doing what was done. For if only this devastation, which was intended for Mr. Cartwright's mill, had been effected, a number of families must have been thereby thrown out of bread, at least for a considerable time, till he could erect new works. It must therefore have produced dreadful distress. But that argument did not prevail with these misguided persons; and for a considerable period of time these deluded, foolish, ignorant and wicked men, were going round the country, destroying all the obnoxious machinery, and stealing arms."

I have been curious to see how many persons concerned in the attack on Cartwright's mill were men who lived in the immediate neighbourhood. They were very few. I suppose the Liversedge men did not wish to be identified with what was in those days a hanging matter. There were, in addition to George Mellor, of Longroyd Bridge, Wm. Thorpe and Thomas Smith, of Huddersfield, hanged for the murder of Mr. Wm. Horsfall the day before the trial began; James Haigh, of Dalton; Jonathan Dean, of Huddersfield; John Ogden, of Huddersfield; James and John Brook of Lockwood (discharged on bail); Thomas Brook, of Lockwood (acquitted); John Walker, of Longroyd Bridge, and John Hirst, Liversedge (acquitted). All those of whom I have not stated the fate were found guilty of tumultuous assemblage and of beginning to demolish a certain mill of Wm. Cartwright, at Liversedge, and incontinently hanged.

The only other Liversedge man who appears to have fallen into the hands of the authorities in connection with this matter was James Starkey, carpet-weaver, who was indicted for inciting two men on September 5th to blow up Cartwright's mill. This prisoner "traversed his indictment, and was discharged on bail to try his traverse at the next assizes." It might be interesting to someone that way inclined to look up the result of the trial of the traverse.

OUR TOWNS AND THEIR TRADES.

No. VIII.- HUDDERSFIELD.

"The prettiest and cleanest manufacturing town in the West Riding, if not in the whole county." Such is the description given of Huddersfield by a Huddersfield man; and it is not too partial to be otherwise than perfectly true. The town strikes a stranger most pleasantly, partly because of the great picturesqueness of its situation, and partly because of the artistic taste with which the buildings have been erected and the streets laid out. Most of the houses are of a fine grey freestone, and are both substantial and ornamental; and the streets, which are modern, are wide, well-paved, and straight. From every one of them the green fields may be seen, for the town is situated partly in a valley, and partly on steep hillsides; and all around it are high ridges, and breezy life-giving moors, many miles in extent. There are three rivers which flow near the town—the Calne, the Holme, and the Calder, and the first especially, which rises on Deanhead Moss, runs through most wild and romantic scenery. There is a park which was presented to the people of Huddersfield by Mr. Beaumont, and bears his name, and which is rendered perfectly unique by the natural beauty of its situation. It was formerly known as Dungeon Wood, and was, says one who loved it, "a place for rustic picnics and delicious child-wanderings." It is along stretch of steep, rocky hillside, and was once covered with oak-trees, which, however, were dwarfed by the cold winds that swept over the moorlands. The park is laid out with great taste; the old oak trunks form bridges over the torrents; and there are pleasant natural terraces adorned with grottoes. In one place there is a garden laid out with the wild flowers of the district— a capital idea, which seems to have originated with the Huddersfield people. But the best of Beaumont-park is the view which is seen from the ridge, of three lovely Yorkshire dales. One of these dales goes up to the high moorlands around Holmfirth; another is a lovely wooded vale, extending up to another waste of moorland above the pretty village of Meltham, in which village there are silk mills, and also the mills from which we get the well-known reels of Brooke's sewing cotton. Over the other vale during five and a-half days a week rests "the great smoke cloud" of working Huddersfield, which tells its own story of honourable toil and domestic home comforts for the people.

The chimneys from which the smoke-cloud comes are necessary to the staple industry of Huddersfield, which is the manufacture of woollen cloths. Here are the mills for the production of the fabric, and also the mills for frilling and washing the manufactured goods. Huddersfield is the chief seat of what is called "the fancy trade," comprising shawls, waistcoatings, flushings, &c., in finest fabric and elegant patterns; narrow and broad kerseymeres, serges, and cords, are also made here. The town is splendidly placed for business purposes, and the people are shrewd enough to take advantage of every facility. Good coal is found near, and there is an abundant supply of water power. The railways and the canals bring it into direct communication with the whole of England, and Huddersfield goods go to all parts of the world.

Of course, both the town and its trade have had their troubles. Huddersfield had lively times during the Luddite insurrection of 1812. The men resolved, or at least some of them did, that the machinery for finishing cloth, which had then been invented, should not be used in the town, and the masters resolved that it should be, so they came to words and to blows. Huddersfield did not begin the mischief, but it soon followed the town that did; and first the confederacy destroyed valuable machinery, and cut into shreds the woollen cloth upon which they could lay their hands—and then decided to give up the frame-breaking, and shoot the masters instead. In 1817 occurred the famous "Folly Hall fight," when some hundreds of men engaged in an insurrection against the Government, fully expecting that their discontent was sufficiently shared by others to lead them to join them. In 1842 a riotous multitude from South Lancashire came to Huddersfield, and drew the plugs out of the boilers in order to stop the works. But all these things are forgotten now, and peace and prosperity reign in Huddersfield. A brisk, thriving, well-to-do town it is, and the people look as if they had plenty of work and good wages. One mill-master has turned his works into a co-operative association, and the workmen are, in a sense, their own masters. Indeed this latter is pretty much the case everywhere in Huddersfield, for the people are a sturdy, independent race, well able to look after their own interests, but perfectly willing to do a good day's work for a good day's wage. There is a strong Nonconformist element, and the people are greatly Liberal in politics.

Slack, which is a part of Huddersfield, was the old Roman town of Cambodunum, and in 1865 the Huddersfield Archaeological and Topographical Association commenced making excavations which resulted in many valuable and interesting discoveries. The Parish church of the town is very old and interesting; it was first built by Walter de Laci in 1073, in fulfilment of a vow made when his life was in danger in the morass that lay between Huddersfield and Halifax; the church has since been twice rebuilt. There are several other fine modern churches in the place, and many handsome and commodious chapels. The public buildings of Huddersfield do credit to the town. The Technical School Buildings are very fine; the Estate Buildings, the Town Hall, and the New Market are all not only useful but highly ornamental. Huddersfield has always been to the front in all educational matters; it was here that one of the first Mechanics' Institute was formed, and here was established one of the first high schools for girls. For boys there is the college, which offers all possible advantages to them. Huddersfield is very musical; there are really good concerts every fortnight, and all the villages around have brass bands of their own. The Naturalists' Society, and the Literary and Scientific Society are well sustained. There is a vigorous branch of the Young Men's Christian Association, and the Sunday schools of Huddersfield are equalled by few.

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PARISH CHURCH OF ST. MARY'S, HONLEY. BY MRS MARY A. JAGGER, Honley, Authoress of 'Rookery Mill,' 'Is Love a Crime?' etc., etc. (Continued from last week.)

A spirit of insubordination now began to manifest itself amongst the people. Work was scarce and food dear. Large bodies of misguided men assembled by night for the purpose of breaking obnoxious machinery that they thought would take the bread out of their mouths. The characteristic Yorkshire clothmakers, however, refused to be intimidated by the threats of their workpeople. Once, creeping stealthily around the walls of the old chapel, the Luddites were intent on taking dire vengeance upon one who had dared to bring into use the hateful machines, the late Mr William Leigh. His house waa opposite the old chapel door. The family were aroused from their sleep by the report of a pistol outside. One of the sons of the village had been chosen by drawing of lots to shoot Mr William Leigh, and with loaded gun he awaited the escape of this gentleman by the back entrance of his house, whilst others were trying to batter down the front door with huge stones, so as to force him to escape by the back door. The clank of the accoutrements of the cavalry sounding distinctly in the distance prevented further outrage. The Luddites then passed up the village street as silently as they bhd come, and Mr Leigh was left unharmed, though his windows were broken. Many a mother's heart must have ached with apprehension and dread as she knelt in the old chapel, for Honley had many of her sons engaged in this insurrection. Transition in crime is easy, and when Mr Horsfall was shot in open daylight, as he was returning from market, tha three Luddites fled from the scene of the murder to Honley, passing under the walls of the old chapel.

The diary begins in April, 1809, when he seems to have entered into board and lodgings at Mr. Henry Bradley's, in King-street, then comparatively a new street. " ...  On the 22 nd of February, 1812, the depredations of the Luddites at the workshops of Joseph Hirst, of Marsh, are spoken of. and a meeting was held at the George, of the principal inhabitants, when a subscription was entered into. and 100 guineas offered for information." Then follow on the 28th April, the account of Mr. Horsfall being shot, and of a voluntary association being formed at a meeting held at the George, for the purpose of watch ing and patrolling the town, and, Bays Mr. Hannah. "I was one of the 20 that watched last night."

Relics of the Luddites.— No doubt many of our readers in the manufacturing district around Huddersfield will remember the agitated state of things in the district, now more than 40 years ago, when the imaginary "General Lud" was a terror to all. At that time the working-classes were goaded on by government spies, and other demagogues, to a degree of madness fearful to contemplate, and very many armed themselves, and were urged on to acts of insubordination, insomuch that Huddersfield had to be a long time occupied by the military before things could be restored to a quiet state. The result of all this was that many poor misguided men were arrested aud cast into prison; many had to leave their country; and many more had to hide both themselves and their arms in the woods, &c., for weeks together. Honley and the neighbourhood was the scene of a share of those troubles, where hidden weapons have from time to time been found, and last week a gun was found secreted in a wood near Ludhill, which seems to have been hid a long time. When found, the wood work was entirely decayed, and the barrel, which is about two feet long, with a wide bore, was rusted nearly through. The piece was loaded, and it is thought it has been there secreted ever since the days of the "Luddites."

[Heckmondwike] At this time we only had three butchers in the town, viz. Messrs. John Gomersall, John Hepworth, and John Parker. ... John Hepworth the butcher above referred to is not yet forgotten, either his sayings or his doings. His eccentricity of character frequently got him into scrapes, though I believe he was a well meaning man. In 1812 during the Luddite riots and murders, soldiers both horse and foot were quartered in the neighbourhood, and Hepworth supplied them with meat, for which payment was made on the 24th of every month. From this circumstance when persons were asked to discharge their accounts, they would frequently reply "It is'nt yet." Hepworth was once apprehended when in a state of partial obliviousness and taken to the guard house, but on being seen by Mr Cartwright, the hero of Rawfolds mill, which was attacked on the 12th of April, 1812, exclaimed "Oh, you brought the butcher, what will you do for your meat tomorrow?  you must take him home," to which he was paraded by two soldiers and delivered to his wife, who is still living, a well known respectable woman. In one of his frolics he once returned home on horseback similarly attended.

An event of this character came off in the Congregational Schoolroom, at Marsden, on Saturday evening last. The room waa crowded. The entertainment comprised a refreshment stall, the exhibition of the working model of a gas works, a large electrical machine, an electro-magnetic machine, stereoscopes, microscopes, musical boxes, a mock fine art gallery, a bran tnb for the juveniles, and a curiosity shop. In the latter were many objects of interest, including a fowling piece belonging to the first Napoleon, the pistol used at the assassination of Mr. Horsfall in the Luddite times, &c. ...

NETHERTON.

A Relic of Luddism.— The murder of Mr. Horsfall during the reign of terror in this district, consequent on the Luddite disturbance in 1811 and 1812, will not soon be forgotten, and many yet living will remember the circumstances related at the time of the murder, and the search then and afterwards made for the weapons used without discovering them. At that time it was positively asserted that the murderous weapon had been buried somewhere in the neighbourhood of Armitage Bridge, or Netherton Wood. A circumstance transpired during the latter part of last week, which tends greatly to clear up this portion of the dark transaction. Mr. G. S. Tolson, manufacturer, of Dalton, has a dyehouse at Armitage, not far from the bottom of the "Big Valley," and has lately purchased that estate. A number of men were last week engaged in removing an old quickset hedge, in order to supplant it with a strong fence wall, and while thus engaged, they discovered the remains of a large horse or cavalry pistol buried deep under the hedge. From the dilapidated state in which it was found, there is not the least doubt but it has lain there for more than half a century. On its becoming known that such a weapon was discovered, many circumstances were related tending to confirm the supposition that this was the very instrument by which the murder was committed, as it is well known the murderers took that direction from Crosland Moor in their way to Honley. Among these circumstances, the following was recollected. An old Waterloo veteran, now 73 years of age, named Bob Wood, some five years ago, while conversing in the Big Valley Hotel with the landlord and John Worth, foreman for Mr. Tolson, declared he knew for a positive fact that the identical pistol with which Mr. Horsfall was shot was buried under the hedge at Armitage, but he could not point out the exact spot. Since the fatal occurrence — now nearly 53 years — this instrument of death has lain where it was found till last week. It is in a deeply corroded state, the whole of the stock and other woodwork completely rotted away, the lock and ramrod are rusted partially away, but the brass trigger guard, and the brass casing or socket that held the ramrod, are in a perfect state of preservation. It is now in the possession of Mr. Jesse Kaye, landlord of the above hotel, where large numbers of people have been to inspect it.

TO DO

The late Mr. Joseph Armitage, of Marsden — This gentleman, who recently died at the advanced age of 81, will be remembered by many who read this notice of his death, though for some years his life has been passed in privacy, and, we are sorry to add, darkened by misfortune. A generation ago his name was a "household word" amongst the manufacturers of Yorkshire, and the merchants of London. Nearly 50 years since, the deceased gentleman was an extensive woollen manufacturer in the Tillage. In the days when Mr. Horsfall was shot by the Luddites, Mr. Armitage was a marked and threatened object of their vengeance, and shared in all the hazards to which enterprising aud improving manufacturers were then liable. For more than a generation he filled, as an employer, one of the most prominent positions in the district. He possessed much influence, and was highly respected; and in the fiscal and political movements of his time he played no unworthy or unimportant part. He greatly assisted in removing many vexatious aud unwise regulations, which have passed from men's recollections, but which 30 years ago materially checked and interfered with manufacturing operations. He survived all his con- temporaries, living to see the whole of the mill property in the village transferred to other hands, and an entire revolution effected in the mode of carrying on the woollen business of the country.

 The Old Hat Inn.— ln reference to the application for a license to this house, Mr. Floyd said that as the bench had adjourned the consideration of Mr. Ox ley's application, and as they had since visited the premises, ie was induced to hope that' they had favourably considered the application. — The magistrates intimated that there was no necessity for further observation. — Mr. Clough still opposed the application. Mr. Clay supported it on behalf of the public. Mr. Clough " wished to know if the public had paid Mr. 018/8 166," (Laughter.) Mr. Clay reiterated his previous assertion, and said the house enjoyed a license till 1812, when it was" taken away in consequence ot the Luddite disturbances. The bench granted the application.

...

In 1812, whilst living near Cowlings, Mr Parker's mother observed, one Saturday night,that she was sure there must be some disturbance at Heckmondwike, as she had heard the reports of firearms in that direction. Mr Parker was then attending the Sunday school in Wm Fearnside's fold (which afterwards removed into the Up Lane School when it was built), and next day being Sunday instead of going to school in the afternoon he walked to Heckmondwike, and found that Rawfold's Mills, at Littletown, had been by the Luddites. Mr Cartwright, the owner, anticipating an attack, had called in the assistance of the military, who, being stationed in the mill, when the attack took place, fired upon the mob, killing two and wounding others. These were the shots heard by Mrs. Parker.

PADDOCK

Treat to Old People. On Saturday evening last, the old people of Paddock, above seventy years of age, were all invited to a knife-and-fork tea at the Liberal Club Rooms. ... Addresses were delivered by the chairman, the Rev. T. Stonely, Mr. Sam Sykes, and Mr. William Wood, one of the guests (83 years of age), whose recollection of events which took place 70 years ago was very striking. He spoke of the Luddite riots which took place in this district, and told the meeting what were the ideas of working men on machinery at that time, and spoke of the fears that were excited by the introduction of a 28-spindled jenny. Many people predicted that the country would be ruined. He saw clearly that the people were wrong, and attributed their action to the lack of education. It was never his privilege to attend any school, but he rejoiced that he had lived to see the erection of Board schools, where the children of working people could receive a good education.

Debate on proposed court of criminal appeal cites 1813 trial

https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000167/18600204/019/0005?browse=true
Huddersfield Chronicle - Saturday 04 February 1860

He argued, that had tbe ground taken been that of mis-direction of the Judge, there was strong reason for the belief that the appeal must have failed on that head, because the Judge had plainly and distinctly put the issue before the Jury, and told thciu that in thair hands the decision on the facts rested exclusively. The answer to that is, that as the law and practice ou this point of mis-direction at present stands, this might be so; but that is no reason why both should not be altered to meet the new circumstances which have of late years arisen in this branch of our criminal procedure — that of the Judge addressing an elaborate argument on the case before the Jury, and indicating strong opinions of his own, before he puts tho issue, and tells the Jury that it is for them to decide. In the case of Palmer, did not the whole country ring with complaints of the advocacy for conviction which ran throughout the whole charge of Lord Campbell? And also again in the case of Dr. Smethurst, by the Chief Baron ) It may be that legally there was no misdirection in either of the cases, as, after this argumentative pleading, and after this indication of strong Opinion, the Judge, in each case, told the Jury that they, and not he, were to decide on all matters of fact; but will any one say that this is a procedure which ought to be encouraged, or that, where it hns beer, followed, the party suffering therefrom shall have no means of redress ! In this particular, the charges of our modern Judges, and especially of late days, contrast most unfavourably with those of their brethren some forty years ago. There were then stirring times in England— and especially it the Criminal Courts. There was then the extensive wide-spread Luddite conspiracy, invoking theft, destruction of property, riot, and murder. The scaffold at York, with its seventeen victims on one day, told of the dangers of the times and the vengeance of the law. I f ever there was an occasion where ardour in a Judge would have been excusable, and where elaborate arguments from the Bench would have been tolerated, surely this was it. But the dread proceeding of the Court in those fearful times was not thus disfigured. Take the summings up of Baron THOMPSON and Justice Le Blanc, even in the most exciting cases that came before the Special Commission at York in 1813, including that for the murder of Mr. Horseall, and there is a tuaiked difference between them and the charges in the cases of Palmer aud Smethurst, by Lord CAMPBELLand Chief Baron Pollock. In 1813 the Judges contented themselves with a summing up of the evidence. They showed how that evidence bore on particular points, when classified ; and this, too, not by way of argumentative application, but by simply reading the evidence in connection, without the expression of an opinion as to the value of that evidence, or its conclusiveness, or otherwise, on the crime charged. In like manner they dealt with the defence, and the evidence offered in its support, and then left the whole issue to the jury. Having recently read the report of the entire proceedings of that memorable Commission, we have been struck with the marked difference observable both in the matter and manner of charges from the Bench of criminal justice, contrasting that period with the present; and we must say, that the sooner our present judicial arbiters depart from the system of elaboration they have taken up, and revert to the simplicity and impartiality of former times, the more creditable will it be for themselves, and for the jurisprudence they administer. If the facts of a case are not Sufficiently clear to cause a jury to convict, without being argued into conviction by the Judge, a verdict of "guilty" ought not to pass, nor ought the Subject against whom a verdict has been thus obtained to be without remedy or redress. Much less ought that redress to be rendered unavailable, because the Judge, after his argumentation and advocacy, may have legally left the issue in the hands of the jury. Sir G. C. Lewis also

A STORY WITH A MORAL. Heathcoat's mill at Loughborough, a factory which for two generations has been the centre of many painful associations, has been totally destroyed by fire. Tbe founder, Mr. Heathcoat, in 1809, invented a new twist lace machine that virtually revolutionised the industry. The introduction of these labour-saving machines led to the Luddite outrages, and in 1816 a gang from Nottingham, armed with pistols, hatchets, and axes, attacked Heathcoat's mill, overpowered the armed watchmen, shot and injured one of them named Asher, destroyed 65 costly frames, out and burnt the lace, and did damage to the amount of more than £10,000. Some accomplices in the outrage gave evidence against their companions, and at Leicester Assizes six men were sentenced to death on a charge of shooting with intent to murder. They were executed at the New Bridewell in Leicester, and it is a noteworthy fact that at those assizes 23 men were condemned to the punishment of death, and such holocausts on the scaffold were by no means uncommon. The six Luddites were hung with a man whose crime was that of setting fire to a stack of oats. The action of the misguided Luddites drove the manu- facture from Loughborough to Tiverton, where Mr. Heathcoat amassed a princely fortune.
