Chapter XVI. Luddism

THE war of 1803 brought yearly increase of taxation, and, being attended by bad harvests, the whole nation suffered, but especially the midland district. The times became troublesome and dangerous, issuing in the revival of Luddism. Frame breaking, as a mode of intimidating employers into compliance with the views and wishes of their workpeople, did not originate in the midland counties and in the present century, as is generally supposed, but was practised in London at least 150 years ago, when the disputes which had occurred for some years respecting the number of apprentices taken by master stocking-makers, came to a point, because one Nicholson had gotten very many of them. The unemployed and irritated journeymen proceeded to break about 100 frames thus worked by him and others, throwing them out of the windows, beating both the obnoxious masters and their apprentices. This occurred about the year 1710, and was confined to Old Street Square, Bunhill Row and the neighbourhood in St. Luke's, Shoreditch, and Cripplegate. The masters were deterred by these proceedings, and agreed to abide by the trade rules as to apprentices in future; while none of the rioters were punished, it is said not even apprehended. But one of the masters who had thus promised, named Fellows, decided to remove his frames to Nottingham, where he set at nought the rules, and, it is said, had at one time forty-nine apprentices, of whom many were bound by their parishes to him; the practice being to pay at least £5 each to the masters on thus getting rid of them.

This system of apprenticing by parishes to the weaving trades throughout the country, besides causing much suffering and demoralization to the oppressed and friendless youths of both sexes who were its victims, gradually so overloaded the trade with wandering unemployed journeymen, as to cause serious riots in various manufacturing populations.

A committee of the House of Commons, after sitting to hear evidence on the subject, instead of stopping the malpractices of parish officers, passed an act in 1727 punishing with death those who destroyed the machinery used in making cloth or hosiery of woollen materials. Whether from the terrible penalty thus threatened, or the greater area over which frame-work-knitting was rapidly spreading in England, acts of violence to the persons or property of hosiery employers seem to have practically ceased for forty years. Though the trade was manifestly leaving London, there were still colonies of stocking-makers here and there; one of the latest of which was located in Spitalfields, where the frames chiefly made silk hose; and thus were nearly allied as to materials with the staple weaving trade of that district. The latter was much excited in 1770 on account of depression of wages, and which were sought to be raised by the terror arising from nightly destruction of the warps in those looms, the wages for weaving in which were paid for at an under price. These nefarious proceedings were largely aided by the neighbouring frame-work-knitters. Some of the silk weaving rioters were taken, convicted, and hanged in front of the doors of the houses where the offences were committed. The London stocking-makers were greatly deterred by this severity from such lawless proceedings in future. Besides the Spitalfields' act, another was passed empowering justices to regulate wages, and if needs be to raise them — a measure which was not repealed until 1824.

The riotous spirit was not laid at rest; it had only migrated into the midland district of England. Two bills having been rejected in 1778-9, which had for their object the regulation of apprenticeships and prevention of fraudulent work, chiefly upon the evidence of Mr. Need and some other hosiers, the country stockingers flocked into Nottingham, their frames were thrown broken into the streets, and a house was burnt down between 10th and 19th June, 1779. Much other property belonging to obnoxious hosiers was destroyed. The riot act was read, and soldiers were called out. Such was the effect upon the minds of the authorities as well as the hosiers, that at the instance of the former, the latter, on 19th June, declared themselves unanimously determined as a body, provided an immediate cessation of violence took place, to remove every oppression from their workmen, and to bring all the manufacturers up to a fair price, not the highest rate, but the best generally given." Upon this peace was restored. A man, Mephringham, was tried at the assizes for aiding in burning the house, but was acquitted : upon which this sad conflict was allowed to come to an end. On this occasion about 300 stocking-frames belonging to Need and others were broken, they having been mostly employed in making spurious and, as it was then and up to 1850 generally considered by the workpeople, fraudulent work.

In 1773, a newly invented stocking-machine was taken out of the Exchange at Leicester by a mob and destroyed, in spite of the entreaties of the mayor and others. Also Coltman and Gardiner, wool combers of Leicester, had a man in their employ in 1788, who invented the present mode of spinning animal wool by machinery into worsted yarn, applying the principle embodied in Arkwright's cotton spinning frames. To this man, named Brookhouse, the Leicester woollen hosiery trade is indebted for laying the foundation for much of its great extent and flourishing condition. His new plan was approved and taken up by Messrs. Coltman and Whetstone, two of the largest makers of worsted yarn in Leicester, and machinery was constructed to carry it into effect. But it was all destroyed by a mob of workpeople, together with the dwellings of Coltman and Whetstone. Before the riot could be quelled the military were brought into the affray, and blood was shed.

Thus the use of this important process was driven from Leicester at that time into Worcestershire, Yorkshire, and even to Aberdeen; from which parts for the next forty years, Leicester hosiers had to obtain much of the materials they worked up. Meantime Mr. Brookhouse set up his machinery at Warwick, and worked upon his invention with such success as to gain a fortune, upon which he retired.

A list of prices, which had been agreed to in 1787 by both masters and men, had been in the main adhered to during the following twenty years, when from rapidly decreasing demand lessened prices for goods and consequent pressure upon the workmen ensued. In 1809 several hosiers, amongst whom were Haynes, Nelson, Brocksopp, and Eaton, agreed to reduce their wages 3s. per dozen if the workmen would not or could not obtain a reduction of frame rents, and the entire cessation of cut up spurious work. To these two things the workmen were very heartily opposed; but at a time when they could only get scanty labour if any, such as was within their reach, however ill remunerated, was not to be rejected. The time and circumstances on which the author is now entering, he himself passed through, and he has a most painful and vivid recollection of them. The fear of an entire cessation of demand in the markets of North America, the heavy burden of war taxation and the loans necessary for national purposes, left manufacturers everywhere only confined means, and lowered credit. In the hosiery districts the warehouses were full of goods. How many thousands of times was that cry repeated — "Give us work at any price; half a loaf is better than no bread!" It was a heavy cry uttered too often ever to be forgotten. The years 1811-12 were sorely distressful, and even dangerous in a high degree throughout the three midland counties. There was as little unity of opinion amongst the hosiers as to the causes of the difficulty under which all were labouring, as amongst the men. The higher class of employers paying best wages and making the best goods, eschewing altogether the manufacture of the spurious cut up goods, laid the larger part of the blame on their lower competitors giving less wages, making worse goods, underselling them, and destroying what little confidence buyers who still possessed means had in making purchases. The misery of the poor dependants on wages which when at work were reduced to an average of about 7s. a-week, but often not now in their power to earn, rapidly drew towards the point that passes endurance, as the close of the year 1810 approached. So great and rapid was its progress during the next year, that the number of unemployed families relieved from the poor rates of the three parishes in Nottingham on the 30th January, 1812, was 4248, including 15,350 persons, or nearly one half of the then population. For twelve months past many working men had swept the streets in Nottingham, Leicester, and Derby, receiving a scanty eleemosynary pittance for their labour. Threats of vengeance had been loudly uttered against hosiers paying reduced wages. Early in March, 1811, many of these men came in from all parts of the county, and proceeded to carry their threats into execution. There was an assemblage in Nottingham market-place. The military appeared, so there were no acts of violence attempted in the town. But sixty-three frames, chiefly belonging to Messrs. Bolton, were destroyed at Arnold that night. Two hundred more were broken in the next three weeks. These things were done no doubt by persons led on by able, daring, and resolute workmen. How many there were thus banded (as it was no doubt justly stated on oath), was never known publicly. It was believed the number was small of those actually engaged in the work of destruction, and that most of them were young. If so, they compensated by an activity almost ubiquitous for their want of numerical force.

But this would partly account for their unexampled secrecy, and the fact, that for years scarcely any were brought to justice. Samuel Slater, a frame-smith, was said to be a principal leader, if not general Ned Ludd himself — so designated from the act of one Ludd or Ludlam, a Leicestershire lad, who, when desired by his father, a stocking-maker, "to square his needles," i.e. to place them in a perfectly straight line in the front of his machine, took his hammer and beat them into heaps. There were said to have been four companies or gangs, one each for the districts of Sutton Ashfield, Nottingham, Arnold, and Swanwick. Frames

were sometimes demolished the same night at places twelve miles apart. They made their attacks in parties of from six to fifty, and seem to have implicitly obeyed the command of their leaders. Those on guard were armed with swords, pistols, guns, and other weapons; the actual frame breakers carried sledge hammers, axes, &c. After the work of destruction was done, the captain called them over by numbers, to which they answered, and on his firing a pistol, the men uncovered their faces and dispersed.

An effective military force of about 800 horse and 1000 foot, was concentrated chiefly in and near Nottingham, under the direction of several experienced military officers who had orders to consult with the local magistrates and two London police magistrates, specially sent down by government, to assist in every way practicable. Money was secretly offered for information; and a royal proclamation was issued offering £50 reward for the apprehension of any offender. Notwithstanding all these measures, the devastation increased in extent and violence as the winter came on, and many country frames were brought into Nottingham for safety.

In November, 1811, one Hollings worth's frames were broken at Bui well, and all the furniture in his house destroyed. On this occasion resistance was offered by discharging loaded fire-arms at the assailants, whereby one of them, John Westby, of Arnold, was mortally wounded. There was great excitement at his funeral; the riot act was read; the high sheriff, magistrates and military being present. The enraged rioters destroyed next day a waggon-load of frames near Arnold, and a few days after thirty-seven frames at Sutton in Ashfield, belonging to one Betts, whose factory they sacked. Soon after he died deranged. Here the Yeomanry Cavalry caught four frame-breakers — Bradbury, Marshall, Green and Clarke — who were committed for trial. Stacks were burnt whose owners were active members of that force. In the following week thirty-six more frames were broken. The magistrates published a letter which states:—

"There is an outrageous spirit of tumult and riot, houses are broken into by armed men, many stocking-frames are destroyed, the lives of opposers are threatened, arms are seized, stacks are fired, and private property destroyed, contributions are levied under the name of charity, but under the real influence of terror."

It goes on to point out —

"That all this tends to insurrection, and that it is their duty to suppress these evils by civil and even military force, and to cause the due execution of laws which will affect the lives of offenders."

This address had no effect in checking the outrages. In the last week in November, forty-five frames, chiefly making cut-ups, were broken at Basford, and others at Nottingham, Chilwell, Cossall, Eastwood, Heanor and Arnold. Upon this, the public-houses were ordered to close at 10 P.M. and inhabitants warned not to be out after that hour. The hosiers and lace manufacturers now felt sufficiently alarmed to hold a general meeting, at which it was resolved, "that if peace were restored they would be prepared to receive and consider proposals from their workpeople and remove grievances if any were found to exist." Twenty more frames were destroyed the following week, and the minds of the people were evidently inflamed by the tenor of the Royal proclamation. Farmhouses were plundered of provisions and money by men who declared "they would not starve while there was plenty in the land." It was in this last week of November, 1811, that the writer of these lines, then a youth of scarcely seventeen, was required by his masters to get into the saddle and make a long round, to convey the information that if their frames, of which they employed about 3000, were spared from the destruction with which they were threatened, one shilling per dozen advance would be paid the following Saturday, and be continued whether others paid it or not. It was a dreary afternoon with heavy rain and winter sleet. He rode hard, and at Basford, Bulwell, Eastwood, Heanor, Ilkiston, Smalley, Sawley, Kegworth, Gotham and Euddington, delivered to their head frame-work-knitters the joyful news of the offered advance. The wintry storm, though uncomfortable enough to the messenger, tended greatly to the success of his message. It prevented for that night the marauding parties employing themselves; these frames had been undoubtedly doomed, for an example, as belonging to one of the most influential houses in the trade. The promise made was faithfully performed; not one of their frames was injured, and no further fears were excited as to the safety of their property. The author served for a whole year (at this time of alarm) as a special constable, and though so young had others, at first civilians and afterwards foot soldiers, to lead every second or third night. In the latter case six men armed with muskets were told off, and at 5 P.M. having received the instructions and pass-word from the sitting magistrate, he did the duty of patrolling with them in the town until six the following morning. The responsibility was new and weighty, and not altogether unattended with danger, the Luddites being armed; and knowing they hazarded their own lives, they were not chary of the lives of others. Their daring and courage were shewn in the instance of one who entered a house alone in Rutland Street, Nottingham, one evening; proceeded up stairs and smashed the material parts of a frame in a minute or two; but that short time was sufficient to cause an alarm; constables were in front of the house, and the author happened to be on duty, in Park Street, behind it. The man at once perceived his danger, threw himself on the roof; passing along others he saw in the dim light that the earth had been lately turned up in a garden below, and leaped from the eaves of a three-story house upon it. The frame-breaker quietly passed through a kitchen where a family were at table, and escaped. In a few minutes the shouts of a sympathising crowd were heard at New Radford, half a-mile from the scene of the adventure. Nineteen warp frames worth £200 were broken at Linby, and fourteen stocking-frames at Ruddington, with twenty at Clifton, in the first fortnight of 1812; also fifteen frames were destroyed at New Radford, nine at Basford, nine at Hucknall, five in Nottingham, and three at Butwell — sixty-eight in all; and the Sunday night following, eight in Nottingham in eight minutes. Wheat was now £5. 8s. per quarter, employment scarce, and there was great suffering. The

town of Nottingham seemed as if in a state of siege. A large subscription was now entered into throughout the county, for the purpose of stimulating endeavours to suppress these outrages. It was headed by the names of the Dukes of Newcastle and Rutland, Earl Manvers and Lord Middleton, with others of £500 each; Messrs. Sherbrooke, Manners Sutton, and many others, £100 each, &c.

At the March assizes in 1812, judge Bailey sentenced four frame breakers to fourteen and three to seven years' transportation — leaving the commission of assize open, that if needful he might return and administer summary justice on any delinquents. At the July assizes, one was sentenced to fourteen years' transportation and another to three years' imprisonment for frame breaking.

In March an act was passed, extending the punishment of death to any one breaking a frame employed in manufacturing any kind of material. In April, Mr. Trentham, a Nottingham hosier, was shot by two men, but not mortally wounded, while standing at his own door. They were never discovered, although £600 was offered for their apprehension. In November this year, Luddism became again prevalent, chiefly on Sunday evenings. Several frames were broken at Snemton; but a bold defence of some others, made by Mr. Black, caused the practice again to cease for a time.

When the government brought in the Bill which made breaking frames punishable with death, Lord Byron strongly opposed it in a debate which took place in the House of Lords, 27th February, 1812. In this, his maiden speech, he forcibly described the condition of things then existing around and in close proximity to his own dwelling, Newstead Abbey. His Lordship said —

"To enter into any detail of the riota would be superfluous, the House is already aware that every outrage short of actual bloodshed has been perpetrated, and that the proprietors of the frames obnoxious to the rioters, and all persons supposed to be connected with them, have been liable to insult and violence. During the short time I recently passed in Nottinghamshire, not twelve hours elapsed without some fresh act of violence; and on the day I left the county I was informed that forty frames had been broken the preceding evening, as usual, without resistance and without detection.

"Such was then the state of that county, and such I believe it to be at this moment. But whilst these outrages must be admitted to exist to an alarming extent, it cannot be denied that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress. The perseverance of these miserable men in these proceedings tends to prove that nothing but absolute want could have driven a large and once honest and industrious body of the people into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves, their families, and the community. At the time to which I allude, the town and county were burdened with large detachments of the military, the police were in motion, the magistrates assembled, yet all the movements, civil and military, had led to nothing. Not a single instance had occurred of the apprehension of any real delinquent, actually taken in the fact, against whom there existed legal evidence sufficient for conviction."

During these excesses in Nottinghamshire, though few frames were broken in Leicestershire, yet the spirit of discontent was equally active there, but it shewed itself in a far more rational form. During the disturbances which prevailed, producing great alarm amongst the resident nobility and gentry, as well as all persons of property and others peaceably disposed, Mr. Gardiner relates, in his Music and Friends, vol. I. p. 476, that—

"Being at Wigston Hall, Lord St. John enquired of him their cause; to which he replied, ' a party was going about drawing out and taking away the jack wires from the frames of those working under price.' This act renders a frame useless for the time, but does not injure it; and when restored, the part may be replaced in the frame, by a competent person, in a few minutes time, so that it may be set to work again. Jack wires had been drawn and deposited in the churches at Arnold and elsewhere, before the more decisive step of destroying the frames was adopted."

During the same year, 1811, Gardiner, being in London to oppose as a hosier the proposed bill for legislatively giving powers to fix the fashion and price for making all kinds of frame-work knitted goods thereafter to be made, had an interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Manners Sutton, the representative of an ancient Nottinghamshire family, in the course of which his Grace said, "I am much alarmed at these Luddites, and fear they will produce a commotion if they are not speedily put down." A fear which pervaded for the time the whole kingdom. Gardiner replied :

"It is to be lamented that the operatives entertain very wrong notions about the improvements in machinery; and I am sorry to find well educated persons join them in saying they are injurious to their interests. Genius is not to be stopped in this savage manner. If invention is not allowed to work here, it will be carried abroad and ultimately destroy our trade."

Upon this subject an old and experienced Leicestershire stocking-maker remarked, "Frames were broken in 1811-15, not on account of disputes about wages, but of cut-up work, which lowered the demand for fully wrought goods, and so tended to reduce prices generally."

In October, 1814, the house of Mr. Thomas Garton, at Basford, was attacked. This person had caused the apprehension of a sworn Luddite, James Towle (afterwards hanged at Leicester) and being in expectation of this visit, he had obtained the assistance of several constables who were then with him. Several shots being fired, they fired in return, when Samuel Barnford, one of the assailants, fell. The rest in retreating shot a neighbour, Mr. Kilby, dead at his own door, which he had opened on hearing the report of firearms. Some wide frames making cut-up work were broken in and near Sutton in Ashfield about this time.

A long cessation of Luddism ensued, until, in the night of the 18th of June, 1816, nineteen lace machines were broken in the shops of William Wright and Thomas Mullen. Two men were tried for this offence, and saved by their counsel, Mr. Denman, successfully pleading an alibi. If they had been convicted the judge and jury were to have been shot by armed men, many such being in the court.

Whether the daring character, the extent of property destroyed, or the consequent dreadful results to the culprits, be considered, the attack on the factory of Messrs. Heathcoat, Lacy, and Boden, at Loughborough, which took place in the night of the 28th of June, 1816, was one of the most deplorable of these memorable affairs. Fifty-five frames were destroyed of the value of £8000 or £10,000, and the lace upon them was burnt. But the most serious and fatal part of these proceedings to the prisoners ultimately tried, was the "firing a pistol at John Asher, one of the workmen in the place, with intent to kill him." James Towle, who had been previously tried for frame breaking and acquitted, was found guilty of this attempted murder at the Leicester Assizes in August, 1816. He was executed in presence of an immense multitude, shewing undaunted self-possession, repeating and singing a hymn with seeming fervour.

Daniel Diggle was convicted at Nottingham, in 1817, of shooting George Kerrey, at Radford, in December, 1816, and wounding with intent to kill. He had pleaded guilty, and deplored on the scaffold his association with Luddites, thereby disobeying the commands of his parents.

The same year, at Leicester, eight men, Savidge, Withers, Amos, Watson, Mitchell, Caldwell, Crowder, and Clarke, were arraigned for the attempt on the life of Asher at Heathcoat's factory. John Clarke was tried alone, on account of the challenges exhausting the jury list. On this occasion there was the additional evidence, such as it was, of Blackburn and Burton, two accomplices, given avowedly to save their own lives. It seems from the statement of the first of these, and who appears to have been an active man amongst the managers of the frame breaking conspiracy, that £18 was given Withers, (who probably led the party and was one of the prisoners), with which to buy tools and fire-arms for the rest; £40 more was promised to be paid when the frames were broken, and £60 more to be collected and distributed among the men actually engaged. Savidge was active in the money part of the affair. "The Radford job had not yet been paid for, though promised; and none but old Neds" (men who had been thus employed before) "would do for this expedition," which was felt to be one of hazard, requiring the utmost boldness and experience. Seventeen names were enumerated as forming this picked party. The jury found Clarke guilty; as did another jury the next day the seven others. A woman, whose husband was a workman in the factory, gave evidence, that hearing the noise of frame breaking, she went into the street, and being laid hold of by Savidgo, one of the prisoners, asked him why they broke the frames? He answered, because Heathcoat's men were working under price. On which she replied, the men were satisfied, and they had no business to break the frames. She swore to the identity of seven of the men charged.

Being found guilty, six were hanged and two were transported for life. The former shewed great firmness, addressing the spectators, and all joined in singing a hymn, one repeating it for that purpose. Fifteen thousand spectators witnessed the execution. After this scene Luddism seemed to have become extinct; no frames being broken in these parts for several years. About one thousand stocking-frames and eighty lace machines were destroyed during this outburst of popular frenzy.

The practice extended into the northern counties, it was professed on account of the increase of machines directly calculated to supersede manual labour. In regard to the object had in view by the Nottinghamshire frame breakers, opinions at the time and since have much varied. Probably there were various hopes entertained by the multitudes around, who sympathised undoubtedly with the movement, though they stood aloof from personal efforts to promote it. The broad substratum of the whole of this wretched heap of wrong-doing was undoubtedly the hunger and misery into which the large portion of the fifty thousand frame-work-knitters and their families were fallen, and from which they never fully emerged for the following forty years. During that long interval, the average of the framework-knitters clear earnings by long hours of labour did not exceed six shillings a-week,

It was upon the occasion of the condemnation of the eight men at Leicester, that Gr. Henson and William Robinson took up to London a numerously signed petition for mercy, but before it could be presented, Henson was arrested, examined before the council, and confined seven months in Coldbath fields as a state prisoner, on suspicion of high treason.

Amongst the papers on trade subjects which Grovenor Henson left behind him, is one, which if true — and there seems no reason to doubt it, as to the main facts related — throws considerable light on the question how this bobbin net frame breaking originated and was carried into effect. The paragraph is as follows:

"The patent machines were worked by hand; in a few years wheels were put in to work the carriages by machinery, which improvements doubled the speed, and these machines were called 'Loughborough improved.' But even then, the patentees were pressed by the warp Mechlin nets, and had to reduce wages one-third. Upon this the (Nottingham) warp committee confederated with Lacy's Loughborough hands and the turn-outs; and the resolution was taken, though it was then in the midst of summer, to destroy his machines. This was effected. Heathcoat was obliged to build entirely new machines."

Lacy's hands referred to, were probably point net or warp lace workmen. When Heathcoat's patent traverse net factory was established, the newly sprung up manufacture of warp lace was making rapid strides towards taking the place of the decaying trade in point net, and absorbing the hands, gave a very high rate of wages, therefore these workmen could well afford funds; and to destroy so formidable a rival as the twist net patentee, they would be very likely to find the money. About £120 in all was promised for this business, and another recently performed was yet owing for, shewing that in both trades, hosiery and lace, when it was a question of breaking frames, the work was done for hire. No doubt the committee would select the ' old Neds' most suited for the purpose. The members of these trade societies were at that time and for twenty years after, bound together by secret oaths, and their leaders acted with most despotic power. It is not too much to say, that there was no trade combination in the three midland counties during the first forty years of this century with which — though he might not, and in this instance doubtless did not, take a part — Henson was not acquainted, both as to their leaders and designs, and in due time their operations. Thus, before the first frames were broken in March, 1811, at Arnold, at a conference with Brocksopp and other hosiers, it had been agreed "to give the men ??wwabated wages, provided they would join in bringing up the under paying masters to the same standard and to put down cut-up work." Henson expresses, in his manuscript account, great indignation because the men in this instance would not carry out the plan — which if he did not devise, he strongly approved — but went and broke Brocksopp's frames amongst the first batch at Arnold.

In various conversations twenty to thirty years after, he recounted at some length the fears and hunger and thirst of four of the men amongst the seventeen who made the attack on Heathcoat's factory; who lay concealed, he said, the whole of the following day in the long grass then covering Loughborough meadows, not daring to stir from under the burning sun till night, and then not venturing to cross the bridge over the Soar, or through the toll bar at Cotes, for fear of detection, taking bye-paths along the river by Zouch Mills, there crossing it, and so pursuing their course over Red hill, crossing by the Trent ferry at Barton they took their way along the bank, till they reached Nottingham and their homes. The names of three of these he mentioned, whom he described as having been deeply implicated in most of those acts of violence since 1811; but who on effecting this escape, and the equal danger of being denounced by approvers on the trials of their comrades, separated themselves from all lawless courses ever after, becoming wiser and sadder men. One of them lived until a few years ago, employed as care taker of valuable stock in a warehouse, and was a faithful and trusty servant. He wrote, it is believed, a full account of what he knew of Luddism, to be read after his death. But the paper, if it exists, has not been accessible to the author, through the sudden and lamented decease of the late Alderman John Bradley, of Nottingham.

The name of the fourth frame breaker who escaped, Henson would never reveal, but promised to leave behind him "an historical account of Luddism," of which, if he should die first, the present author might avail himself. Such a document has not been found, which is much to be regretted, as its contents would have been both curious and valuable. So much was gathered from Mr. Henson, notwithstanding the decided repugnance he usually shewed to enter into details on this subject, as to make it quite evident that the executions, which took place in 1816-17, were, in his opinion, the efficient cause of the disappearance of Luddism from the midland counties.

The proprietors of the machinery which had been destroyed at Loughborough, sued the county for the damage, which on an enquiry ordered by the King's Bench, it was decided must be paid to the amount of £10,000. The magistrates required that the sum when handed over should be expended locally. To this Mr. Heathcoat gave a decided refusal, and the amount was never received. He said that "his life had been threatened; and he would go as far off as possible from such desperate men as these frame breakers were." He agreed with Mr. Lacy that their future course as to the erection of new machines should be distinct; and in conjunction with Mr. John Boden, of Loughborough, who had become a partner and the director of the sale of their lace goods in London, a purchase was made of a large mill at Tiverton in Devonshire, where machinery could be driven by the powerful stream of the Exe. This building was restored and enlarged, and the construction of rotary power machines was at once commenced and vigorously carried on until in the end three hundred were at work there. This decision, directly consequent upon the unlawful and deadly violence of a combination of workmen, has already deprived the midland district of the employment and profit derived from six or seven hundred machines, during the fifty years which have since intervened. Comment on such a fact is unnecessary.
