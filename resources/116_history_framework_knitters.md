TO LACE MANUFACTURERS, HOSIERS, LACE-MAKERS AND FRAMEWORK-KNITTERS

On Monday next, Jan. 11, 1830, will be published, AND MAY BE HAD AT THE REVIEW OFFICE, PRICE TWOPENCE, No. 9 of A HISTORY OF THE FRAMEWORK-KNITTING AND LACE TRADES, From the earliest invention, the Rev. Wm. Lee, in 1589, until the year 1830.

At a period like the present, when the greatest distress prevails throughout the Midland Counties, it has been thought, by numbers of well-informed persons, to be absolutely necessary to trace the causes of that distress, which is overwhelming the nation; more especially, as the most erroneous notions have gone abroad, respecting the trade of these counties, as to the object of the working classes *to put down Machinery, and to prevent improvements*.

The object of the above arduous work will be, by a faithful narrative of the last 250 years, to rescue the character of the merchant and workman from the obloquy thrown upon them, in consequence of their opposition to the new system, of destroying every legal restriction, and letting the concerns of trade go to anarchy and (as is now proved) to destruction, by suffering every thing respecting trade and manutactures (save and except as to revenue enactments) to find their own level.

In pursuance of this design, the work will contain a faithful narrative, from the traditions of the early stocking-makers in the South of England, of the invention, and the difficulties which Mr. Lee encountered in the discovery of the knitting frame, until its perfection, in its present shape, in the reign of Queen Anne, after a series of improvements made during 120 years. In the course of which will be described the emigration of Mr. Lee, at the solicitation of the French Government; the seducing of the frame work-knitters to emigrate, by foreign ambassadors; with the charter and laws made to prevent the practice. In the course of the work will be given an account of the inventions of the various machines, from the tuck-presser, in 1740, to the rotary lace machines of the present day, including the various fashions, modes of work, and other useful matter.

This work will also contain a careful and select abridgement of the laws respecting masters, workmen, and apprentices; as also the various laws respecting paying wages, finishing work, and combination and revenue laws which concern the knitting and lace trades.

A full account will be given of various applications made to Parliament, to regulate the trade, in 1725, 1753, 1779, 1787, 1812, 1818 and 1823-4, in which will be given the speeches of the Members, the interviews with them and the Ministers, and all other necessary and useful information.

This work will also contain a candid and true narration all the riots which have taken place respecting the disputes in the trade, including frame-breaking in London in 1710-12; the riots in Devonshire which gave rise to the first frame-breaking act; the riots and frame-breaking at Arnold, in 1779; the riots in Leicestershire, from 1780 to 1790; the frame-breaking 1787; the riots of the troopers and stockingers in 1794; the twilled riot in 1795; the riot and frame-breaking at Arnold, Sutton, &c. in 1812; the frame-breaking at Bulwell, in November, 1812; with the whole of the acts of the Luddites, in the years 1812-16, including the acts of the rioters, machine-breakings, and burning of the mills, in the counties of York, Lancashire, and Cheshire, with a faithful narration of the causes which led to those disturbances, traced from the earliest periods; the riot and march of Jeremiah Brandreth and his Derbyshire followers; the projected riot of the meeting on Nottingham forest; in which will be included a narrative of the Manchester Blanketeers — the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act — the imprisonment under that act—the spy system, carried on by Oliver, Bradbury, and several inhabitants of Nottingham and its vicinity—the secret means used by the instigators are developed and exposed—and all other mutters connected with the riots of the trade, will be impartially and coolly narrated.

The various trials for offences will also be given, including the trial of Mephringham, in 1779, for pulling down a house; the various prosecutions under the combination acts; the trials for Luddism, at Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester; the trial of Brandreth, Bacon, and the Derbyshire rioters; the trial of Simpson, for felony; the trial of Diggle, for shooting; and other criminal trials respecting the trade.

The various executions of Simpson, Diggle, and Towle—the executions at Leicester, and those at Derby, will be described, as will the execution of the rioters in Lancashire. Yorkshire, and Cheshire.

The various civil actions will be given, in the trials respecting the charter, those respecting the various patents, and the prosecutions respecting embezzlement, paying in goods, stealing of hosiery and lace. &c.

A succinct account will be given of the history of the trade in Ireland and Scotland, containing a quantity of useful information.

A statement will also be given of the rise and progress of the trade in France, the state of the machinery, &c.; the laws and the conduct of Bonaparte towards the French working classes; as also the conduct now pursued by the French government, as to manufactures, including the present state of the lace trade in France, and containing a narrative of the adventures of several English workmen at Lyons, Nismes, Castres, Paris, Calais. Lisle, &c.

An account of the state of the trade will given, in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Saxony, Germany, Oenmark, and the United States; to which will be added, an account of the tariffs and customs which affect the trade of England in foreign states.

A history of the machine-wrought hosiery and lace manufactures
by Felkin, William

Publication date 1867

pp. xv-xvi

Mr. Gravener Henson began a *History of the FrameWork-Knitting and Lace Trades*; and, in a moderate sized octavo volume published in 1831, brought his account down to the year 1780, but there ceased from the want of public support. This arose from his diffusive manner, and some peculiar opinions set forth with needless prominence. It contains much information on the rise of the manufacture of tissued fabrics, and the early course of those on which he specially treats. He had a practical knowledge of most kinds of looms, and describes them correctly, though in a technical manner. Being familiar with local inventions, he had materials to work upon, and it is to be regretted he did not finish his history. His printer, seeing that instead of one volume, several on his plan would be necessary, advised him to condense. He had not the nerve to do this, and gave up the work. Henson wrote with surprising facility and grammatical correctness. His petitions to parliament, memorials to ministers, and letters to public men were striking, but injudicious: often containing libellous invectives. Once, being directed to draw up a memorial to the Treasury on the difficult subject of the 'Export of Machinery,' he brought the next day twelve foolscap pages closely written, without interlineation or blot; which, after being compressed and expurgated much to his chagrin, was a cogent and effective document.
