The following Circular has been issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

(COPY)— Circular— *Whitehall , March* 27, 1817.

My Lord , —As it is of the greatest importance to prevent as far as possible the circulation of Blasphemous and Seditious Pamphlets and Writings, of which, for a considerable time past, great numbers have been sold and distributed throughout the country; I have thought it my duty to consult the Law Officers of the Crown, whether an individual found selling, or in any way publishing such Pamphlets or Writings might be brought immediately before a Justice of the Peace, under a warrant issued for the purpose, to answer for his conduct. The Officers having accordingly taken this matter into their consideration, have notified to me their opinion, That a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged before him upon oath, with the publication of Libels of the nature in question, and compel him to give bail to answer the charge. Under these circumstances, I beg leave to call your Lordship's attention very particularly to this subject; and I have to request, that if your Lordship should not propose to attend in person at the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden in and for the county under your Lordship's charge, you would make known to the Chairman of such Sessions the substance of this communication, in order that he may recommend to the several Magistrates to act thereupon in all cases where any person should be found offending against the law in the manner above mentioned. I beg leave to add, that persons vending Pamphlets or other Publications, in the manner alluded to, should be considered as coining under the provisions of the Hawker's and Pedlar's Act, and be dealt with accordingly, unless they shew that they are furnished, with a License, as required by the said Act. I am, &c. SIDMOUTH.

To his Majesty's Lieutenant in the county of _____.

[TH: we might also note further down the page, the following report: *By accounts received from Leicester we learn that eight of the Luddites, tried at that town , have_been capitally convicted , and received sentence of death . A ninth ( JOHN SLATER ) has been convicted under the Frame-breaking Act , and sentenced to transportation for life . The tenth was seized with convulsion fits during his trial , and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence , was remanded to prison .*]

LORD SIDMOUTH'S CIRCULAR.

OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN, REFERRED TO IN THE CIRCULAR LETTER FROM VISCOUNT SIDHOUTH TO HIS MAJESTY'S LIEUTENANTS OF COUNTIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, DATED MARCH 27, 1817.

We are of opinion that a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party charged on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice Of the Peace. With respect to the Secretary of-State, in the case of Entick v. Carrington, reported by Mr. Hargrave, though the Court were of opinion the warrants which were then the subject of discussion were illegal, yet Lord Camden declared, and in which he stated the other Judges agreed with him, that they were bound to adhere to the determination of the Queen v. Derby, and the King v. Earbury ;in both of which cases it had been holden, that it was competent to the Secretary of State to issue a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with a scandalous and seditious libel; and that they, the Judges, had no right to overturn those decisions.

With respect to the power of a Judge to issue such warrant, it appears us, that at all events, under the statute of the 48th Geo. III. ch. 58, a Judge has such power, upon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that act; a Judge would probably expect that it should appear to be the intention of the Attorney-General to file Information against the person charged.

With respect to a Justice of the Peace, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Mr. Wilkes's libels only amounts to this—that libel is not such an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his Privilege of Parliament, or to warrant the demanding sureties of the peace from the defendant: but there is no decision or opinion that a Justice of the Peace might not apprehend any person not privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge. It has certainly been the opinion of one of our most learned predecessors that such warrants may be issued and acted upon by Justices of the Peace, as appears by the cases of Thomas Spence and Alexander Hogg in the year 1801. We agree in that opinion, and therefore think that a Justice of the Peace may issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information on oath with the publication of a scandalous and seditious libel, and compel him to give bail to answer such charge. W. GARROW. S. SHEPHERD.  Lincoln-Inn, Feb. 24, 1817.

IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT

HOUSE OF LORDS

*Monday May 12th*

CIRCULAR LETTER OF VISCOUNT SIDMOUTH.

Earl GREY rose to bring forward his promised motion relative to this subject. He had to request the most serious attention of their Lordships to what would transpire in the discussion, as it may constitute the foundation of some future proposition to be submitted. It appeared, that under this new practice, for such he must call it, being unsupported by any previous authority, a Justice of the Peace was empowered to send any man to gaol upon a charge of publishing a blasphemous or seditious libel, unless he procured bail. Now what said the opinion of the Law Officers referred to? "That a warrant may be issued to apprehend a party charged on oath for publishing a libel, either by the Secretary of State, a Judge, or a Justice of the Peace. "With regard to the power of a Secretary of State to issue warrants, that had been so well established by the decisions of Courts, that he did not now intend to dispute it. Whether it was originally an usurpation or not, it had been established by competent legal authorities. The opinion proceeded to state (and he had a right to presume that a Judge had no such power at common law, as it was not stated in the opinion), "that, at all events, under the Statute of the 48th of George the Third; chapter 58, a Judge has such a power, upon an affidavit being made in pursuance of that Act, a Judge would probably expect that it should appear to be the intention of the Attorney-Genaral to file an information against the person charged." He apprehended the true construction of the Act to be, that there must be an affidavit or certificate of an information filed, before the Judge could grant a warrant. The opinion then went on to refer to the case of Mr. Wilkes, and to state that the decision in that case amounts only to this, "that libel is not such an actual breach of the peace as to deprive a Member of Parliament of his privilege of Parliament, or to warrant the demanding sureties of the peace from the defendant; but there is no decision or opinion that a Justice of the Peace might not apprehend a person not so privileged, and demand bail to be given to answer the charge." The necessary of such an opinion must be to give to every Justice of the Peace in the kingdom the power of holding to bail any person, or of depriving such person of his liberty, for any publication whatever which that Justice might, in his opinion, deem a libel. And this was not confined to blasphemous or seditious libels, to the former of which the opinion did not allude, but it applied to all libels, private or public , whether deemed scandalous or malicious, or blasphemous or seditious. In any case in which a Justice of the Peace deemed a libel to have been published, he was to be authorised to hold the party to bail. To justify this opinion, the Law Officers referred to the opinion of a learned predecessor of theirs. He could not, however, after the most patient investigation, discover any authority upon which the dictum now set up in the opinion and the Circular could be supported. As the Noble Earl proceeded in his discussion, he referred largely, and read copious extracts from the writings and decisions of the most established English law authorities; the general drift of his legal argument being to establish, that the ordinary Magistrates or Justices of the Peace possessed no such legal power, as they were assumed to be vested with in the Circular Letter of the Noble Secretary of State. Even from the opinion referred to itself, it appeared that, previously to the Bill of the King, their were strong doubts as to the existence of such a legal power even in a Judge. He felt warranted in contending that the act in question did not give such a power generally to the Judges, and still more, he must protest against the existence of such a legal power as was claimed generally for all Justices of the Peace, to decide what was or was not a libel ( which was the most difficult point in the whole system of the law ), and upon their opinions of the cases, to exact bail from any man who was concerned in the publications in questions. He had no difficulty in stating from the best examination he was able to give to all the great law authorities of the realm, that he could not find any such power distinctly stated, as that now claimed for Justices of the Peace. He (Lord Grey) was aware that this was open to question: but if so great an authority as Lord Coke entertained even a doubt of the power of a single Magistrate to commit for felony, their Lordships ought not to decide without being very sure of the ground of their decision, that a Magistrate had that power with reference to any less offence. On a point so material to the liberty of the subject, the question was, whether any clear and distinct opinion could be found that a libel, because it was cognisable at a Sessions, was an offence for which, out of Sessions, and before the finding of an indictment, a Magistrate had the power to order a warrant of commitment, in default of bail? There was a passage in Hawkins, referring to a practice, which might be supposed to convey to the Magistrate a more extensive authority. "It is now the practice," said he, "for a single Magistrate to issue his warrant on the suspicion of felony, or of any other misdemeanour, before the indictment is found." But it was by no means a fair construction of the passage, to contend that the offence of libel was comprehended in its meaning; and from the context, he maintained that the opinion of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins was decidedly against the legality of any such power in a Magistrate as that in question.—"For," added he, speaking of the practice with reference to a misdemeanour, "as it is a claim which a justice possesses by connivance rather than from law, he cannot be too cautious in its exercise." On the whole, therefore, the great legal authority of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, instead of sanctioning the opinion recently delivered by the Law Officers of the Crown, directly militated against it. He was aware that a particular passage in the works of Lord Chief Justice Hale seemed to countenance the opinion recently given. But it was evidently felonious offences alone to which Lord Chief Justice Hale referred when he spoke of "such crimes as were withing the cognisance of the Sessions of the Peace." The title of the chapter assisted to prove this. It was "Concerning Felonies." It was an acknowledged rule of construction, that an opinion must be taken with reference to the subject propounded for discussion. What was that subject in this case? Felonies. It must have been to felonies, therefore, that Lord Chief Justice Hale adverted: and the passage in question could not legitimately receive that extensive construction which some might wish to move it. But in the second volume of his works, Lord Chief Justice Hale spoke more distinctly on the subject. His statement was, "A Justice of the Peace has the power to grant a warrant for the apprehension of a person charged with felony or breach of the peace, although not indicted." In support of this opinion the Lord Chief Justice Hale cited many cases to prove the legality of this power in cases of felony and breaches of the peace, but in no other cases. He confined himself specifically and distinctly to felonies and breaches of the peace, and did not utter a word beyond those cases. Such appeared to be the limit of the Magistrate's authority. There was nothing here to support the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, "that a Justice of the Peace might issue a warrant to apprehend a person charged by information, on oath, with the publication of a scandalous and seditious libel, and to compel him to give bail to answer to such charge." The utmost that could be made of the case by human ingenuity would be, to leave the matter in some degree of doubt; although, for himself, he declared he had no doubt whatever respecting it. But admitting that it was doubtful, it was certainly not a case which a Secretary of State, on the authority of the Law Officers of the Crown, was warranted in recommending to the general adoption of the Magistrates throughout the kingdom. The Noble Lord dwelt with most force and at greatest length on the consideration of the celebrated proceedings which took place before Lord Camden, in the of Mr. Wilkes. The decision of that most learned and revered Lawyer was, he contended, in support of what he advanced, though the case respected a warrant of the Secretary of State. The authority of Lord Mansfield also, in certain cases to which he referred, was in furtherance of this argument. In this part of the discussion, the Noble Earl distinguished between the powers vested legally and constitutionally in a Secretary of State, and those lodged in an ordinary Justice of the Peace; and seemed to admit, that in the former those powers were vested, which were were now assumed to be vested in the superior Magistrate: and he descanted on the difficulty in legally deciding upon cases of libel which were endeavoured to be simplified and defined by the admirable Bill of a late Right Hon. Friend, of his ( Mr Fox ), the greatest lawyer of an uneducated man he ever, knew, and, which was most ably supported by his Noble Friend ( Lord Erskine ) then present; and he adjured the House not to lend its sanction to a new and anomalous power in the law, so dangerous to individuals, and eventually dangerous to the State itself. The opinions given by the law servants of the Crown could not, he thought, be without some degree of bias on their minds, and those opinions ought to be appreciated by their Lordships. Independent of the objectionable considerations in a legal view of the case, such an interference on the part of the Executive Government to influence the administration of justice, ought seriously to be deprecated. The whole presented a case of a dangerous and unconstitutional nature; and in deciding upon it their Lordships should seriously consider its probable consequences, either with a view to the eventual effect it might have on the conduct of the people on the one hand, or on the other in strengthening the overgrown power of the Government, so as to create a power in its hands not a little participating of the character of a military despotism. After apologising to the House for his long detention, the Noble Lord closed a short but eloquent peroration, by moving, "That a Copy of the Case, upon which the opinion of his Majesty's Law Officers, referred to in the Circular Letter, of Viscount Sidmouth, was given, be laid before the House."

Lord Ellenborough said, no person doubted that a person guilty of vending such publications as could tend to inflame the public mind, should be held responsible for them. The custom of the Attorney-General on the last day of every term, in moving for a continuation of recognisances, justified what he was now saying. Indeed, from the very nature of the case, he was fully satisfied that Magistrates had the powers now assigned them; and in fact the country would be placed in a truly miserable situation were such not the case. If this was not the law of the country, it would be impossible for the Courts of Law to proceed in business; and he must beg leave to add, that it would be impolitic in their Lordships to adjourn a single day without taking some steps to make this a law. He now held in his hand an extract of the dates of recognisances which had been entered into on this subject, by which it had been held that persons might be put to bail for libels, before indictments were found or even filed against them. The Attorney-General's Lechmere and North, &c. had done so; and the uniform practice of the Courts had shewn the authority and rectitude of such proceedings. In the case of a conspiracy, he must confess he should, without doubt, hold the person liable to bail. He had never heard it disputed that Magistrates could hold to bail, and he believed this had been the understood practice from the era of the Revolution. No individual, he believed, could have more regret than himself at seeing an individual unnecessarily exorcised by law, but still he saw no reason why a person should be screened from the effects of his delinquency. On the whole his Lordship, considering the Magistracy had the power which this circular letter supposed them to have, declared that he was decidedly prepared to give his vote accordingly.

Earl Grey's motion having been ably supported by Lords ERSKINE and HOLLAND, and opposed by the Lord CHANCELLOR and Viscount SIDMOUTH, was, on a division, negatived by a majority of S8.

Adjourned.
