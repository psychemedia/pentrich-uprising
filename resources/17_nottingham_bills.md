# Nottingham Outrages Discussed in Parliament

At the end of November, 1811, the local Magistrates had ordered the early closing of public houses at 10 o'clock and seemed to make it known that anyone out after that time might be assumed to be engaged in the "mischief" of the time.

But as the frame-breaking outbreaks continued through the first few weeks of 1812, more extensive powers granted under an act of Parliament were called for.

More severe punishments for the act of frame-breaking itself were also called for, under the argument that this would act as a deterrent. For men found guilty of frame-breaking, which was classed as a simple felony, the maximum sentence that could be applied was transportation; but if it could be proven that the men had entered with an intention of burglary, then the penalty was a capital one. And the capital sentence was now being sought for frame-breaking in its own right.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS.

NOTTINGHAM, JANUARY 29.—It is impossible to convey a proper idea of the state of the public mind in this town, during the last four or five days: The constant parading of the military in the night, and their movements in various directions during both night and day, give us the appearance of a state of warfare—may we not have it more in reality!

The destruction of more than twenty frames, at Lenton, on Thursday evening last, within a few hundred yards of our barracks, and two being cleanly carried away in a neighbouring hamlet the same night, heightened the state of alarm; and the operations of several subsequent nights have given it an additional increase.

On Saturday night the frame-breakers crossed the river Trent, broke fourteen frames at Ruddington, and twenty at Clifton, leaving but two whole in the latter town. An express was sent off to Nottingham for a troop of the Hussars, who went with all possible speed; and as many of the Bunney troop of yeomanry as could be collected, (they being in the neighbourhood of the scene of action) were immediately mounted—one party pursued the depredators, while others seized all the passes over the Trent for the space of four miles, under a full persuasion that the Luddites could not escape; but, such is the generalship of the latter, that they seized a boat which nobody else had thought of, and repassed the river in two divisions, in perfect safety, and escaped.

The same night a frame was broken at Bulwell, while a Serjeant and six men, belonging to the Berkshire Militia, were employed to watch it—the parties exchanged shots several times, but it is not known that any one was wounded, though one of the Luddites lost a shoe and his hammer.

On Sunday night 45 frames were broken at Selson, Bagthorp, and the neighbouring hamlets, about nine miles from this town; and the same evening, about seven o'clock, a circumstance took place at Basford of the most daring description; for, while three soldiers were in the house of one Wm. Barns, to protect three frames, a party of *Luddites* entered the house, and immediately confined the soldiers; and while two of the party stood sentry at the door with the soldiers' muskets, others demolished the frames; and, when the mischief was done, the muskets were discharged and the soldiers liberated, and the depredators wished them a good night.

On Monday evening, three more frames were broken in the same village, one of which was taken and fixed on the top of the round-house, or village prison, and there left as a public spectacle, which was seen by many.

These things are done almost in the face of eight Officers from Bow-street, an immense local police, and three regiments of soldiers.

The last mentioned night 26 frames were demolished at Cotgrave, a village six miles South of the Trent; and the depredators again escaped across the water without detection. And, notwithstanding. the number of men who have been taken up, it is the general opinion, that not one real frame-breaker has been taken; nor, from the best information I can obtain, has any thing like correct evidence been drawn from any of the prisoners.

Four prisoners were yesterday brought in, with great parade, by three several parties of military and civil officers; two of whom are persons who have had frames broken in their own houses, and another is a well known Maniac of the name of Waplington, who is at the present time a pauper of St. Mary's parish, in this town, and who has for years been in the habit of wandering about. It excited much laughter to see Bow-street Officer, with this poor creature confined in a cart by his side, driving furiously along the streets, and guarded by about half a score Hussars. It is supposed the maniac has been caught in one of his wandering excursions; and, as usual, refused to give an account of himself.

RIOTS AT NOTTINGHAM.

It is with pleasure we state, that the destruction of frames this week has been much less than that of the last. On Monday evening one frame was broken at Bobbers-mill, and carried clean away; and one on Tuesday night at the same place. On the last mentioned evening, one frame was broken at Basford, and the same evening, two were broken at Taghill, in the vicinity of Heanor, in Derbyshire, and five at Burton-Joyce. On Tuesday the Royal Buckinghamshire Militia arrived here, 38 waggons, having left barracks at 7 o'clock on the preceding Friday. Yesterday two field-pieces arrived, which belong to the regiment. On Wednesday two more troops of the hussars likewise entered this town. We understand that the two London Magistrates have been using their utmost endeavours to learn whether politics have any connection with the present troubles in this neighbourhood; and we likewise understand that they are convinced of the contrary. Committed since our last, for trial at the assizes, W. Barnes, of Basford, charged with haying, in company with divers other persons at present-unknown, wilfully, maliciously, and feloniously broken, destroyed, and damaged two frames.

*Letter from Ludd*.—The following is a literal copy of a letter stated to have accompanied the returned articles which had been stolen at the time when the frames were broken at Clifton:

"Unknown Stranger, I have intrusted these Articles into your Care and do insist that you will see that they are Restored to their respective oners is with extream Regrat that inform you hou they Came into my hans when I came out with my men their weir sum joind us that I Never had ad with me before and wear these Villinds that plundered but ass we wear going out of Clifton one of my Men came and told me that he Beiievd that those Men got somethinck that they had no Business with I theirfore gave horders that thay should be searched and what we found on them we left the things at the Lown End and I hope that the oners has got agen we were just agoen to have hang'd one the Villends when we weir informed that the Soldiers weir at hand and we thot it Right to Reatreat.

"N, B. The Men that had the things were entire strangers to horders or they Never dworst not have tuch'd one thinck but they have been punished for their vileny for one of them hare been hanged for 3 Menet and then Let down agane I ham a friend to the pore and distrest and a enemy to the oppressors thron.

FRAME WORK BILL.
HL Deb 27 February 1812 vol 21 cc964-79 
Second reading

Lord Byron rose, and (for the first time) addressed their lordships as follows:

My Lords; the subject now submitted to your lordships for the first time, though new to the House, is by no means new to the country. I believe it had occupied the serious thoughts of all descriptions of persons, long before its introduction to the notice of that legislature, whose interference alone could be of real service. As a person in some degree connected with the suffering county, though a stranger not only to this House in general, but to almost every individual whose attention I presume to solicit, I must claim some portion of your lordships' indulgence, whilst I offer a few observations on a question in which I confess myself deeply interested.

To enter into any detail of the Riots would be superfluous: the House is already aware that every outrage short of actual bloodshed, has been perpetrated, and that the proprietors of the Frames obnoxious to the rioters, and all persons supposed to be connected with them, have been liable to insult and violence. During the short time I recently passed in Nottinghamshire, not twelve hours elapsed without some fresh act of violence; and on the day I left the county I was informed that forty frames had been broken the preceding evening, as usual, without resistance and without detection.

Such was then the state of that county, and such I have reason to believe it to be at this moment. But whilst these outrages must be admitted to exist to an alarming extent, it cannot be denied that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress: The perseverance of these miserable men in their proceedings, tends to prove that nothing but absolute want could have driven a large, and once honest and industrious, body of the people, into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves, their families and the community. At the time, to which I allude, the town and county were bur 967thened with large detachments of the military; the police was in motion, the magistrates assembled, yet all the movements civil and military had led to—nothing. Not a single instance had occurred of the apprehension of any real delinquent actually taken in the fact, against whom there existed legal evidence sufficient for conviction. But the police, however useless, were by no means idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected; men, liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital crime of Poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times! they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved Frames. These machines were to them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to starve. By the adoption of one species of Frame in particular, one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment. Yet it is to be observed, that the work thus executed was inferior in quality; not marketable at home, and merely hurried over with a view to exportation. It was called in the cant of the trade, by the name of 'Spider work.' The rejected workmen in the blindness of their ignorance, instead of rejoicing at these improvements in arts so beneficial to mankind, conceived themselves to be sacrificed to improvements in mechanism. In the foolishness of their hearts they imagined, that the maintenance and well doing of the industrious poor, were objects of greater consequence than the enrichment of a few individuals by any improvement, in the implements of trade, which threw the workmen out of employment, and rendered the labourer unworthy of his hire. And it must be confessed that although the adoption of the enlarged machinery in that state of our commerce which the country once boasted, might have been beneficial to the master without being detrimental to the servant; yet, in the present situation of our manufactures, rotting in warehouses, without a prospect of exportation, with the demand for work and workmen equally diminished; Frames of this description, tend materially to aggravate the distress and discontent of the disappointed sufferers. But the real cause of these distresses and consequent disturbances lies deeper. When we are told 968that these men are leagued together not only for the destruction of their own comfort, but of their very means of subsistence, can we forget that it is the bitter policy, the destructive warfare of the last 18 years, which has destroyed their comfort, your comfort, all mens' comfort? That policy, which, originating with "great statesmen now no more," has survived the dead to become a curse on the living, unto the third and fourth generation! These men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless, worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread. Can you, then, wonder that in times like these, when bankruptcy, convicted fraud, and imputed felony are found in a station not far beneath that of your lordships, the lowest, though once most useful portion of the people should forget their duty in their distresses, and become only less guilty than one of their representatives? But while the exalted offender can find means to baffle the law, new capital punishments must be devised, new snares of death must be spread for the wretched mechanic who is famished into guilt. These men were willing to dig, but the spade was in other hands: they were not ashamed to beg, but there was none to relieve them: their own means of subsistence were cut off, all other employments pre-occupied, and their excesses, however to be deplored and condemned, can hardly be subject of surprize.

§It has been stated that the persons in the temporary possession of Frames connive at their destruction; if this be proved upon enquiry, it were necessary that such material accessories to the crime, should be principals in the punishment. But I did hope, that any measure proposed by his Majesty's government, for your lordships' decision, would have bad conciliation for its basis; or, if that were hopeless, that some previous enquiry, some deliberation would have been deemed requisite; not that we should have been called at once without examination, and without cause, to pass sentences by wholesale, and sign death-warrants blindfold. But, admitting that these men had no cause of complaint; that the grievances of them and their employers were alike groundless; that they deserved the worst; what inefficiency, what imbecility has been evinced in the method chosen to reduce them! Why were the military called out to be made a mockery of, if they were to be called out at all? 969As far as the difference of seasons would permit, they have merely parodied the summer campaign of major Sturgeon; and, indeed, the whole proceedings, civil and military, seemed on the model of those of the Mayor and Corporation of Garratt.—Such marchings and counter marchings! from Nottingham to Bullwell, from Bullwell to Banford, from Banford to Mansfield! and when at length the detachments arrived at their destination, in all "the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war," they came just in time to witness the mischief which had been done, and ascertain the escape of the perpetrators, to collect the "spolia opima" in the fragments of broken frames, and return to their quarters amidst the derision of old women, and the hootings of children. Now, though in a free country, it were to be wished, that our military should never be too formidable, at least to ourselves, I cannot see the policy of placing them in situations where they can only be made ridiculous. As the sword is the worst argument that can be used, so should it be the last. In this instance it has been the first; but providentially as yet only in the scabbard. The present measure will, indeed, pluck it from the sheath; yet had proper meetings been held in the earlier stages of these riots, had the grievances of these men and their masters (for they also had their grievances) been fairly weighed and justly examined, I do think that means might have been devised to restore these workmen to their avocations, and tranquillity to the county. At present the county suffers from the double infliction of an idle military and a starving population. In what state of apathy have we been plunged so long, that now for the first time the House has been officially apprized of these disturbances? All this has been transacting within 130 miles of London, and yet we, "good easy men, have deemed full sure our greatness was a ripening," and have sat down to enjoy our foreign triumphs in the midst of domestic calamity. But all the cities you have taken, all the armies which have retreated before your leaders are but paltry subjects of self congratulation, if your land divides against itself, and your dragoons and your executioners must be let loose against your fellow citizens.—You call these men a mob, desperate, dangerous, and ignorant; and seem to think that the only way to quiet the "Bellua multorum capitum" is to lop off a few of 970its superfluous heads,—But even a mob may be better reduced to reason by a mixture of conciliation and firmness, than by additional irritation and redoubled penalties. Are we aware of our obligations to a mob? It is the mob that labour in your fields and serve in your houses, that man your navy, and recruit your army, that have enabled you to defy all the world, and can also defy you when neglect and calamity have driven them to despair. You may call the people a mob, but do not forget, that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people. And here I must remark with what alacrity you are accustomed to fly to the succour of your distrest allies, leaving the distressed of your own country to the care of Providence or—the Parish. When the Portuguese suffered under the retreat of the French every arm was stretched out, every band was opened, from the rich man's largess, to the widow's mite, all was bestowed to enable them to rebuild their villages and replenish their granaries. And at this moment, when thousands of misguided but most unfortunate fellow-countrymen are struggling with the extremes of hardships and hunger, as your charity began abroad it should end at home. A much less sum, a tithe of the bounty bestowed on Portugal, even if those men (which I cannot admit without enquiry) could not have been restored to their employments, would have rendered unnecessary the tender mercies of the bayonet and the gibbet. But doubtless our friends have too many foreign claims to admit a prospect of domestic relief; though never did such objects demand it. I have traversed the seat of war in the peninsula, I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey, but never under the most despotic of infidel governments did I behold such squalid wretchedness as I have seen since my return in the very heart of a Christian country. And what are your remedies? After months of inaction, and months of action worse than inactivity, at length comes forth the grand specific, the never failing nostrum of all state physicians, from the days of Draco to the present time. After feeling the pulse and shaking the head over the patient, prescribing the usual course of warm water and bleeding, the warm water of your maukish police, and the lancets of your military, these convulsions must terminate in death, the sure consummation of the prescriptions of all political Sangrados. Setting 971aside the palpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of the Bill, are there not capital punishments sufficient in your statutes? Is there not blood enough upon your penal code that more must be poured forth to ascend to Heaven and testify against you? How will you carry the Bill into effect? Can you commit a whole county to their own prisons? Will you erect a gibbet in every field and hang up men like scarecrows? or will you proceed (as you must to bring this measure into effect) by decimation? place the county under martial law? depopulate and lay waste all around you? and restore Sherwood forest as an acceptable gift to the crown, in its former condition of a royal chase and an asylum for outlaws? Are these the remedies for a starving and desperate populace? Will the famished wretch who has braved your bayonets, be appalled by your gibbets? When death is a relief, and the only relief it appears that you will afford him; will he be dragooned into tranquillity? Will that which could not be effected by your grenadiers, be accomplished by your executioners? If you proceed by the forms of law where is your evidence? Those who have refused to impeach their accomplices, when transportation only was the punishment, will hardly be tempted to witness against them when death is the penalty. With all due deference to the noble lords opposite, I think a little investigation, some previous enquiry would induce even them to change their purpose. That most favourite state measure, so marvellously efficacious in many and recent instances, temporizing, would not be without its advantages in this. When a proposal is made to emancipate or relieve, you hesitate, you deliberate for years, you temporise and tamper with the minds of men; but a death-bill must be passed offhand, without a thought of the consequences. Sure I am from what I have heard, and from what I have seen, that to pass the Bill under all the existing circumstances, without enquiry, without deliberation, would only be to add injustice to irritation, and barbarity to neglect. The framers of such a Bill must be content to inherit the honours of that Athenian lawgiver whose edicts were said to be written not in ink but in blood. But suppose it past; suppose one of these men, as I have seen them,—meagre with famine, sullen with despair, careless of a life which your lordships are perhaps about to value 972at something less than the price of a stocking-frame—suppose this man surrounded by the children for whom he is unable to procure bread at the hazard of his existence, about to be torn for ever from a family which he lately supported in peaceful industry, and which it is not his fault that he can no longer so support, suppose this man, and there are ten thousand such from whom you may select your Victims, dragged into court, to be tried for this new offence, by this new law; still, there are two things wanting to convict and condemn him; and these are, in my opinion,—Twelve Butchers for a Jury, and a Jefferies for a Judged!

HOUSE OF COMMONS.

MONDAY, Feb. 17.—The House went into a Committee of Supply, and a Resolution for granting £100,000, for the service of the Local Militia, was agreed to, and the Report ordered to be received to-morrow.

FRAME-BREAKERS' BILL.

On the Order of the Day for the second reading of the Nottingham Frame-Breakers' Bill being read,

*Mr. Abercromby* highly reprobated the conduct of the persons whose crimes had caused the Bill to be brought into the House; at the same time he was sorry to say it was impossible for him to concur in this Bill, which he considered would be wholly ineffectual, and therefore injurious. It was a measure of the greatest importance, and ought to be treated with the greatest caution; consequently, he hoped the Right Hon. Gentleman would not press the second reading immediately.

*Mr. Hall* thought the situation of the county of Nottingham was such as called for the immediate passing of the Bill; he should, therefore, support the second reading of the Bill.

*Capt. Herbert* could not give his support to the present Bill, which went to increase the number of capital punishments, till he was convinced the law, as it at present stood, was not sufficient for the punishment of the rioters, if once they were apprehended.

*Mr. J. Smith* thought it necessary something should immediately be done, or the evil might become much more serious than it now is. He supported the present measure, because no better was proposed. He should be most anxious, when the proper time arrived, to have an enquiry instituted into the *causes* of the disturbed state of the counties of Nottingham Leicester, and Derby. He believed it was the decay of trade which had caused them; but let the cause be what it would, he thought the first object should be to put the rioters down. He thought the present measure would have that effect; of course, he should give it his support.

*Mr. Lockhart* thought the terror of such a punishment hanging over their head, as that proposed by the Bill, would have the effect of deterring the rioters in future. This crime, of which the rioters had been guilty, amounted nearly to High Treason; and when the Bill went into a Committee, he should propose that persons tried under it should have the same indulgence that persons charged with High Treason had, namely, having at least one Counsel allowed them.

*Mr. Herbert* supported the Bill. This was not to be a permanent law: it was intended as a mere temporary measure. If our laws were like those of the Medes and Persians, unalterable, he should then, indeed, hesitate before he agreed to an increase of our capital punishments.

*Mr. Wrottesley* opposed the Bill. He was of opinion it would have a contrary effect to that contemplated by the Right Hon. Gentleman who brought it in.

*Sir S. Romilly* agreed that this was an evil to which an immediate remedy should be applied. The question was, would this Bill prove a remedy? He was of opinion it would not; and that the evil would exist as much after passing this Bill as it did at present; if these disturbances arose out of a combination amongst the journeymen, there was a law in existence already, which inflicted a punishment of transportation for 14 years for this offence, but no one had yet been convicted under it. He could see no greater probability of their being punished under the proposed Bill, since, either the rioters had obtained such influence as enabled them to suppress, by terror, all evidence, or those who should carry the law into effect, felt no wish so to do: and if either of these causes were the reason of the rioters escaping, could passing the present Bill, increasing the severity of punishment, operate to remove the difficulty of conviction?—He thought this was a case which demanded the most mature consideration; and that the Bill should not have been moved for and brought in on the same day. Who was there present that knew what was the *origin* of these disturbances? Was it a dislike to the masters, or was it a persuasion that these frames reduced the call for human labour? No Gentleman could answer him; and was it not then necessary that, previous to legislating on the lives of their fellow-subjects, the House should be put in possession of further information?

*Mr. Bathurst* said, the question was not whether there would be a greater number of punishments under the new law than there had been under the old law, but whether the proposed measure would not have the effect of preventing the commission of the crime altogether, by the severity of the punishment it proposed to inflict on offenders.

*Mr. C. Wynne* thought the present Bill would prove wholly ineffectual, and therefore he should oppose it.

*Sir A. Pigot* differed in opinion with those Gentlemen who supported the present Bill. There was already a law of no little severity existing for the punishment of this offence, namely, transportation; and before the Legislature was called on to make a law more penal, it ought to be shewn that persons had been prosecuted under the existing law, and that that law had been found ineffectual. He denied that the proposed Bill would forward the discovery of offenders, or induce persons to come forward more readily and give evidence; he was also convinced, that, as a system of terror, it would fail as a mode of preventing the commission of offences in future. In his opinion, the law, as it at present stood, if properly enforced, would be found fully sufficient for its purpose, and that the proposed Bill would prove ineffectual, and, therefore, he should oppose it.

*Mr. Ryder* said, he did not intend that this should be a permanent measure, but one arising out of the necessity of the moment; and, when in the Committee, it would be proper to fix the period of its duration. He felt much gratified at the testimony borne by Gentlemen on the other side of the House to the exertions of Government in quelling the riots. This mischief was of such a nature, that there was no security against the repetition of it; it must be put down. He did not mean to say, that this Bill would facilitate detection; but when once it was known in the country that Parliament had looked at those offences in the way they ought to be looked at, he was sure there would be the greatest chance of the mischief ceasing.

*Mr. Whitbread* opposed the Bill.

*Mr. Frankland* said, if ever there was an occasion for expressing indignation on the part of the Legislature, it was when the paternal authority of the State was set at defiance, by men who, indifferent to the welfare of their fellow-creatures, were sporting with the lives of multitudes. The present was such an occasion. It was false to say there were more capital punishments enacted by law in this country than in others. It was not a single act of disobedience, but it was an avowed system of defiance to law, that made it necessary to inflict the severest punishment; and this Bill was indispensably necessary for such purpose.

The House then divided:—For the second reading, 84; against it, 17.—On the question, whether the Bill be committed to-morrow or Wednesday,

*Sir S. Romilly* repeated his former objections; and expressed surprise that the Secretary of State did not give a longer notice to the House before he brought in the Bill. This was no remedy for the magnitude of the evil: it would produce no effect, until some act, coming merely within the letter of the statute, was committed, and then it would be in the lenity of the prosecutors, whether it should be inflicted. It was in this conviction that he opposed the Bill.

*Mr. Bathurst* was confident that this law would produce its effect.

*Mr. Frankland* said, this Act was founded on other Acts passed against similar offences.

*Colonel Eyre* spoke a few words in favour of the Bill.

The House again divided:—For committing the Bill to-morrow, 80; against it, 15.

TUESDAY, Feb. 18.—On the motion of Sir Samuel Romilly, the Committee on Parish Apprentices, moved by Mr. W. Bootle last Session, was re-appointed.

Mr. Secretary Ryder moved the Order of the Day, for the House resolving itself into a Committee on the Bill for more exemplary punishing Frame-breaking.

On the question that the Speaker do leave the Chair,

*Mr. Lambe* rose, and said he thought it in general dangerous for Government to interfere in matters of trade, and to hold up to manufacturers hopes of amelioration which probably, in the present circumstances, could not be realized. He considered, however, the premeditated attack on property, which the Bill was intended to prevent, so pregnant with ruin, and so portentous in its consequences, that he deemed some additional remedy absolutely necessary to check the progress of the evil. Detection, he argued, was not rendered difficult by the severity of the punishment already awarded by the law; but a system of terror, which pervaded the whole of the disturbed districts, prevented evidence from coming forward; and this was an argument of the offence itself. He was confident that additional punishment was necessary to deter people engaged in these illegal combinations, and would therefore vote in support of the Bill.

*Mr. Thompson Turner* wanted to be assured that all the means afforded by the law as it stood had been employed to quell these disturbances, before he could give his vote for capital punishment.

*General Tarleton* wished for an inquiry into the causes of the disturbances.

*Mr. Elliston* thought the evil in a great measure originated in the pressure occasioned by the war, which no administration could completely remove; but instead of insulting the lower orders with fallacious hopes, he thought it more prudent and more patriotic, to come, as much as possible, to their assistance, and to teach them to bear with patience those evils which could not be prevented. The dread of capital punishment could never be meant to facilitate detection, not to deter from the offence, and as such was evidently the intention of the House, the Bill should have his support.

*Mr. Courteney* was for the Committee, as was *Mr. Lushington*.

M*r. Wynne* objected to the penalty of death being inflicted by the Bill, on men destroying manufacturing utensils, perhaps of small value, unless it was done by a combination of armed men. An apprentice or a journeyman might be liable to suffer death, under that Bill, for an act of sudden passion against his employer.

*The Attorney General* could not foresee that either Judge or Jury could ever put such a construction on the Bill; and it was to be considered, besides, that one of the principal features of the disturbances was, that the people at whose houses these frames and utensils were deposited, were strongly suspected of being in combination with the rioters.

*Sir S. Romilly* would not trust the life of a subject to any construction of a Bill by either Judge or Jury. If a clause was introduced, enacting pain of death only when more than one person was concerned in the offence, it would remove, in a great measure, his objections to the Bill.

*Mr. Perceval* was of opinion that such a clause would go to defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. It was insurrection in disguise, and when it was considered that many of the holders of those frames were suspected of being parties to the combination, a single man entering a dwelling-house to effect the purpose, while his accomplices stood at the door, would be above the reach of the law. He thought the construction of the Bill might safely be left to the Judges and Jury.

*Mr. Smith* wished the word *damage* to be left out, as conveying too indefinite and extensive a meaning.

A long desultory conversation took place on this amendment. The Bill afterwards passed the Committee with some verbal amendments; and the Report was ordered to be taken into consideration tomorrow.

The Nottingham Watch and Ward Bill afterwards went into a Committee, when several new clauses were introduced, one of which went to extend the provisions of the measures to other counties. The Report was brought up, and ordered for further consideration.

HOUSE OF LORDS.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, no business of public importance occurred at this House.

THURSDAY, FEB. 27.
NOTTINGHAM RIOTS.

The Order of the Day for entering on the second reading of the Nottingham Frame-breaking Prevention Bill being read—

The Earl of LIVERPOOL rose and observed, that the object of the Bill before the House, and the unhappy cause of it were well known. They had originated in a long continued and systematic plan of riot and disorder. No exertions on the part of Government had been omitted to ascertain the causes and prevent the effect of such disorders. Persons had been sent to Nottingham to examine into them upon the spot.—The Bill divided itself into two parts. The second, but most prominent part, went to compel the persons, in whose houses frames and other manufacturing machines were destroyed, to be responsible for the damage and the outrage. The former part was merely conformable to other Acts of Parliament, previously framed with a view to similar offences. The root of the evil appeared to be in the difficulty of detection, and that difficulty rested on the mildness of the law as it at present stood, and which evidently called for that sort of rigour which had often been effectual, by striking terror into the minds of the guilty and the mischievous; but such rigour was only intended to have a temporary operation. It was obvious to review and reconsideration, and by no means meant to add permanency to the severity of the penal code. His Lordship concluded with moving, that the Bill be read a second time.

Lord BYRON observed, that in offering his sentiments on the subject before the House, he should speak from a personal knowledge of a good deal of what related to it. Great disorders had undoubtedly existed, and he had known of 40 frames being broken and destroyed by the active perseverance of a body of men, habitually, till that occasion, industrious and honest. Large detachments of the military had been sent down, and Officers of police had been sent down, and authorised to take up many persons; but these were measures which would much better have been superseded by others of grave, wise, and rational inquiry into the true cause and origin of the disorders. That would be found in the misery attendant on the decay of trade and manufactures, in the policy which had, unhappily for the country, been too long pursued by his Majesty's Ministers, whose proceedings were marked throughout by weakness, rashness, and inconsistency; by marches and countermarches, terminating only in miscarriage, ushered forth with all the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war. The harsh and cruel measure proposed in the Bill he could by no means approve of, and thought that even a mob might be better reclaimed by conciliation and mildness than by rigour; and when he recollected the benevolent exertions which in this country had taken place in behalf of the suffering and distressed Portuguese, he could not help contrasting that benevolence with the harshness set forth in the present Bill. But the evils to the correction of which their Lordships ought to look, were not confined to Nottingham; at Bristol and its neighbourhood he had lately witnessed misery not less striking and deplorable. To obviate such distresses rigour was not the hopeful means; Martial Law and decimation, were not to be applied to a whole country—in short, convinced as he was, that to pass the Bill without inquiry might produce the worst consequences, he should oppose the second reading.

Lord HOLLAND conceiving that he stood in a peculiar situation respecting the Bill under consideration, could not suffer it to proceed without some observation. He had been the first in that House to call the attention of their Lordships to the disorders at Nottingham, but he deprecated being supposed for a moment to have been consenting to any thing so monstrous as the Bill in question; and howsoever he might deplore the evils felt and complained of, he should prefer the rejection to the adoption of the Bill.

The LORD CHANCELLOR should not detain the House long. If the Bill was such as it had been described, unwise, improvident, and foolish, it would well become their Lordships to reject it, but till that was made out he must support the Bill. The disorders in Nottingham were of a different description from those for which the statute of the 28th of his Majesty was provided. They betrayed a systematic defiance of all law. The object of the Bill was to facilitate the means of a detection. For that purpose, both parts of the Bill should be taken in a combined view. The suggestion of the Noble Baron (Lord Holland), respecting the rendering responsible the persons in whose houses frames might be broke, was not practicable, for they were generally persons without property.

Lord GRENVILLE could not suffer the Bill to be read a second time without expressing his indignation at the principle of it. He did expect from the Noble Lords opposite some show or semblance of argument, in support of a measure that was to add another Act to the black and horrible catalogue which marks and stigmatizes our Statute Book. But while he lived in a country professing to be governed by laws, he never would consent to leave the lives of his fellow citizens dependent on the discretion of a Minister, or the mercy of a Judge.

The question was then put, when there appeared for the second reading, 38; against it, 17. The Bill was then ordered to be committed on Monday.—Adjourned.

In the House of Lords, discussion of the Nottingham Frame-Breaking Prevention Bill ended with an amendment was called for that would keep frame-breaking a simple felony not attracting of a death sentence.

Cheltenham Chronicle - Thursday 05 March 1812

HOUSE OF LORDS

Thursday.`[Feb 27th, 1812]`—Several Bills of a private nature were read a first time, as was the Exchequer Bills Funding Bill second time. On the motion for the second reading of the Nottingham Frame-breaking Prevention Bill, Lord Byron, in a maiden speech, stated his conviction that the rioters were driven to the commission such offences by absolute want, and that had a proper investigation been instituted in the earlier stages of the disturbances, the present measure would have been unnecessary. He concluded by recommending that their wants should be inquired into and relieved.

Lords Holland, Grenville, Lauderdale, and Grosvenor, spoke against it; and Lords Liverpool & Eldon in support of it—after which Lord Lauderdale's amendment for adjourning the debate till Monday, being negatived by 32 to 17, the Bill was read a second time.
```

In prosecuting the men charged with frame-breaking, the maximum sentence that could be applied for *frame-breaking*, a simple felony, was transportation; but if it could be proven that they had entered with an intention of burglary, then the penalty was a capital one.


In the House of Lords, discussion of the Nottingham Frame-Breaking Prevention Bill ended with an amendment was called for that would keep frame-breaking a simple felony not attracting of a death sentence.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 07 March 1812

Monday, February `sic` 2.`[March 2nd, 1812]` NOTTINGHAM FRAME BREAKING PREVENTION BILL.

The Order for their Lordships going into a Committee on this Bill, being read,

The Earl of *Harrowby* argued ably and at some length in support of the Bill. He pressed to the consideration of their Lordships, that the dangerous and destructive practises which the Bill was meant to suppress, were now extending rapidly to other parts of the country, and that a speedy and vigorous remedy had become absolutely necessary. The exertions of the police and the existing laws were found insufficient. The measure was, however, consonant to that which had been the course and conduct of the Legislature on former occasions nearly similar, in that of the Woollen Manufactures for instance, when, in the 14th of George the First, the punishment of death was provided for that which previously was only visited with a slight punishment. Noble Lords opposite were pleased to characterize the measure in very harsh language, and to call its authors sanguinary and bloody minded; but they were such bloody-minded men as the Earl of Hardwicke, and afterwards Lord Talbot, both which great and good men approved of the measures to which he alluded. When the middle system was inefficient, it was justifiable, it was necessary to recur to measures of severity when called for by circumstances; and to leave the practical application of that severer system, as particular cases and circumstances may call for it. Upon these grounds and principles, the measure proceeded, principles which more than once, on former occasions, governed the determinations of the British Legislature.

*Lord Grenville* thought the evil of a deeper nature than the Noble Lords were inclined to admit. The great cause was the bad policy which had plunged our Manufacturers into distress. The distress and the cause were spreading together. It was now that the effect of the paper issue was making itself felt thro' the community; and it was impossible in any case to conceive, why the same evils which had extended on an excessive issue of paper, should not be attended with the same evils here as in all other countries.— This was a more prominent cause than even the Orders in Council. His Noble Friend (Lord Lauderdale,) had imputed the distress to the sudden rise and fall of wages by the sudden demands for manufactures; but even where the wages did not fall, the excessive issue of paper lowered their real value. The same money could not purchase the same quantity of provisions; and unless there was a *maximum* on the price of the necessaries of life, the working people must be more and more impoverished, even in the nominal receipt of undiminished wages. The great Manufacturers worked for foreign markets; the rise of the price abroad did not keep pace with the rise of the nominal value of the currency at home; and in consequence, they were obliged to tell their workmen that they could not make the prime cost on their materials. The workmen said, and with not less truth, that they could not live by their work; and thus distress came rapidly among the most useful and industrious class of the community. The present system had the direct tendency of exhausting the resources of the industrious part of the public; this was no new thing to their Lordships; it had been pointed out from the beginning; every step of its progress had been regularly detailed, and it was now making its way with accelerated evil. Was this a thing within penal laws to correct? Were men to be cured of this by the gibbet and the gallows? The Bill might irritate and punish, and inflict miseries dreadful to feeling and humanity; but it would not stop an evil which resulted from the wretchedness into which a dangerous and headlong system had driven the working people. His Noble Friend (Lord Harrowby,) in quoting a passage from Judge Blackstone, seemed to doubt whether that great Judge looked on the punishment of death a means of prevention, or as the penalty for enormous crime. But putting the first point out of question, was the guilt of this crime of that enormous nature which required death? The Noble Lord (Harrowby) obviously combined the individual act with the crime of conspiracy; but the Bill omitted all the intention of conspiracy, and alluded only to the act of the individual. It would be answered, that the intention of the Bill was chiefly against the conspiracy; but where was the object of a Bill to be found but in its leading clauses, or preamble? He was sorry to hear an attempt to justify the introduction of penal statutes by great names. If there was any case in which we should not look to precedents, or give up any thing to great names, it was a case like the present. To justify the infliction of death, there must be no authority but strong necessity. The Statute Book was stained with sanguinary laws; it was a stigma on the character of the country; foreigners looked upon it as such, and appealed to its existence as the standard of our national character. A Noble Lord (Harrowby) spoke of the mildness with which these laws were administered. A Philosopher once said, that among the Athenians, to praise the Athenians was extremely easy; but where were we to find the great evidence of a mild and legislative spirit—the prevention? Punishment was the object of our laws. If the question was of the purity of the administration of justice, he must agree that here we were unrivalled—that there is no country in the world—that there never was a country, where the innocent man was so nearly secure of acquittal as here. But as to punishment, he knew of no country in Europe—perhaps he ought to speak of it as before the late dreadful revolution—where so many suffered by sanguinary punishments. It was impossible to conceive any justification for the spirit, except in the confusion and blending of all principles, or the adoption of that horrible principle of making every offence against the law punishable by death. Were we about to write in blood the new code for the new situation in which we were gradually advancing? In this instance we could not punish without frequently committing the most shocking offences against humanity. Crimes of the most different nature were mingled under one punishment; and death was to be equally inflicted for conspiracy and for acts which a school-boy's whipping would be too severe. Men were to to `[sic]` be hanged for *damaging* frames. What a word! and how capable of perversion. What was *damaging* a frame? The slightest injury to the slightest part of a complicated machinery was to bring a man in peril of his life. This was enough to throw the body of the manufacturing people into despair. Tell them, that if from folly or malice a man break any part of a machine, he forfeits his life, as much as if he had conspired to destroy the whole machinery of the establishment,—as much as if he had murdered the man at the machine; and the consequence must be horrid. The wisdom of Legislators was employed in pointing out the gradations of crime, and making the return always more easy than the progress; but here,

"Returning was as tedious as go o'er,"

and the moment the workman had touched upon his crime, he had incurred the punishment of its consummation.

Lord *Rosslyn*, in a short speech, disapproved of the Bill.

The question was put, on discharging the order for going into the Committee, and carried in the negative.

In the Committee Lord *Liverpool* proposed the omission of the word "damage," and the introduction of others in different parts of the Bill, more accurately pointing out the malicious intention and serious injury.

Lord *Grenville* proposed the omission of the words "person or," which attached the punishment to the individual act, and wished to substitute others, applying it solely to the act resulting from conspiracy. A conversation ensued, in which The Lord Chancellor expressed himself decidedly against the general application, under the impression that unless the individual act was punished as such, the law would be entirely evaded in practice.

Lord *Grenville* declared, in explanation, that he had too much respect for their Lordships' House, to impute personal motives of cruelty to any of its Members. But he would pronounce the Bill now before them most sanguinary in its enactments, and increasing the disgrace which resulted from the already too great severity of our penal code.

After a few words from Lord *Holland*, the amendment was put and negatived.

Lord *Grenville* then proposed a similar amendment in the next clause. The object of the amendment was to exempt from the punishment of death, acts of destruction committed by individuals from private pique or malice, and to include only the cases of those who tumultuously assembled, and unlawfully combined, for the destruction of frame works. It was evident, his Lordship observed, that there was here a very great difference of guilt and danger, and that there ought to be a corresponding difference in punishment.

This amendment was negatived.

Lord *Grosvenor* proposed an amendment, the object of which, we understood to be, that the attempt to destroy should not be declared a felony, but a misdemeanor.—Agreed to.

The clause requiring the occupier of any frame which might be destroyed, to give information to the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, was objected by Lord Grenville, on the grounds of excessive hardship of compelling individuals to leave their homes and families under whatever circumstances, for the purpose of giving the information required. His Lordship therefore moved the insertion of the qualifying words,— "unless such individual shall assign reasonable cause for not having given the information required." Acceded to.

The House then resumed, and the Report was ordered to be brought up to-morrow.— Adjourned.

Report from Committee on FrameWork Knitters

Notts folk had submitted petitions and were trying to gwt a bill to regulate their trade, deny truck payments etc. That as much as the capital sentence bill possibly had as much to do with quelling violence?
