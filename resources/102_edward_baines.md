Leeds Intelligencer - Thursday 02 August 1832

Our contemporary of the Mercury has lately maris a splendid display of that correct taste and feeling for wliich his controversial lucubrations have long been celebrated. We last week noticed his unaccountable mistake attributing to us that of which we were not guilty, namely, " blackguard attacks" upon hfs nominee, Mr. Macaulay he must have been nodding over his mm really, " blackguard attacks" upon Mr. Sadler. But on Saturday last he was quite awake, b<-c<mw tk " main eKanefe" was stake. The meeting of the unemployed workmen upon Woodhouse Moor appear to have carried him to the top of his bent, and agais the Intelligencer is struck at with all the fierceness rage, but, at the same time, with that imbecility excess of passion commonly produces. It is alleged that the notice by which tho tneetirr, was convened was issued from the Leeds Intelligence Office, printed by Hernaman and Perring." " The placard, which was at once fraudulent aril flammatory, suppressed the principal part of the (,W< reurparagraph, and misquoted the other part, for the jure of raising a clamour by imposing upon those who had not t the Mercury. The stratagem, however, did not tale, whole thing proved an entire failure. few straggling pen were seen upon the moor, staring at each other, and ing " What they had been brought there to dor On via a report spread, that Messrs. Hernaman and Perring,: printers of the placard, pitying their situation, h them together to give them a treat of bread and eh( esc, beer. But after loiteriog for some time Rsoer, bread and cheese, like that Knavesmire, did not and they separated iv disgust after passing some one which ought to have been that they are never lit a see better times till the Corn Laws are repealed, and till than four hours out of every twelve of their hdwar i. to pay their share the millions in taxrs, : which they are indebted to such politicians We! Hernaman and Perring. It was intended, ur lei have had a fine display in front the Mercury c. promotion of " loyalty and social order," tiie aiOi used to call it. But this miserable exhibition would »«<!*• hear rhat the Meeting was adjourned till a N when it is said that free beer is to dispensed fi the Blue Committee-room, at the Intetligei err office ; to report, wiil the first act of charity that - perpetrated at that place." The writer of this paragraph has evidently been a pitiable state of excitement, though his ang r, his charge of" blackguardism" was wholly misdin the Proprietors of the Intelligencer having no i do with originating the meeting, or prep..; placard, than the Mercury himself; having i rely acted as printers in the way of business, tit rectness of which assertion they are ready to n even Mr. Mercury upon evidence which i tlispute; and this, we apprehend, is a sufficient » to both the wit and the malice of our contemn irary's discreditable paragraph. But it appears that the printing of a placard the Intelligencer-Office, for the Operatives, is, in Mr. Baines's estimation, an inexpiable offence. " adjourned meeting" was held on Monday, anil strange lo say, Messrs. Hernaman and Perring the printers of the notice; why Mr. Haines was not chosen, in preference, we cannot say; but certain I it that he did not on that day print for the v - ployed workmen yet he caused to printe ' distributed too, most plentifully, on the Moor, I .long tirade of afeuse. ajjii. misrepresentation the Intelligencer, and praise of himself and his own ous actions, in the expectation, we suppose, brii. -' back those whom he considers to wander when' cease to bring grist to his mill.

The writer knows well—and no Operatives—that' the Intelligencer, within the W three years, has changed hands, and that the 

Editor has uniformly advocated the cause the poor and the oppressed in Leeds—as he had for many years previously done elsewhere in similar capacity. We are not disposed either to vaunt our own merits, or to decry those of Mr. Baines. If he can look back with satisfaction to all that he has done for the poor workpeople, let him enjoy his reminiscences, especially those which relate to the Luddite crimes and punishments. And granting that all be right in this and other respects; granting that Mr. Baines has laboured and spent his strength the cause of the workpeople this district, we rather think that those people have well paid for all benefits conferred, for their pence, his keeping, have swelled to pounds; and noW the great Mr. Baines kicks away the ladder. Whatever he may have been—whether faithful |i atler mis-leader, he is, at all events, no longer ,;,le side with the people, but has become the ministerial delinquency, the supporter of fettered placemen, the libeller of the poor, and the ppnonent of that boon of humanity which they are Muscling to obtain at the hands of the legislature. the friend of the poor, he is become their ,'rcrsarv the most vital sense; they have thcrec quitted his selfish standard, and began to think themselves. If in the exercise their own free .•il] they choose to bring some of their favours to the Intelligencer-office, they have done so without solicintion, direct or indirect, and we humbly submit that . trend reason why Mr. Baines should vent his _. ra tli a shower of gross and libellous falsehoods man the head of the Editor of the Intelligencer. feel great pain in thus speaking of a matter in which have personal concern but the peculiar rocity of the attack, and the circumstances under which made, certainly call for the remarks we have ottered. We are not thin skinned. We defy the utmost stretch of Mercurial malignity. Yet we should be culpable were we to display indifference as to public opinion, especially when the shaft of our unneighbourly assailant is aimed at private character kss than at public usefulness.
