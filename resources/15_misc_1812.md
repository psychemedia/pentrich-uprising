YORKSHIRE LENT ASSIZES

...

Mr. Justice Le BLANC addressed the Grand Jury in nearly the following terms:—

"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY,  
"Assembled as we are at present in the ordinary discharge of a duty you have so often been called upon to perform; I should have felt it unnecessary to trouble you with any observations if a case had not occurred which seemed from its infrequency to require some notice. The list of offences, though somewhat longer than usual, does not appear to contain many cases of novelty, and I hoped to have had the pleasure of congratulating the County of York in having escaped the contagion of that system of depredation which has continued so long and occasioned such extensive mischief in a neighbouring county, but this hope has not been fully realised; I am grieved to find from a case in the Calendar, and from information received since we arrived here, that this county has not entirely escaped the influence of bad example; but I trust there will be found not only sufficient vigilance in the magistracy to suppress these disorders; but, also courage in the subjects, to protect their property from the attacks of these depredators. The advantages of machinery in manufacture has been so clearly proved, and the subject so ably discussed, that it excites surprize that any should be found so ignorant and infatuated as to imagine that the destruction of machinery should better the situation of the persons employed in manufactures. These absurd ideas have been refuted over and over again, not only by writers on the subject, but by the Judges in their different circuits, that one might have expected none could be found ignorant enough to be influenced by them, and I should have hoped no man would have been as wicked as to instil such mischievous notions into the minds of these deluded men. The Legislature has heretofore provided penalties and serious penalties for the protection of this species of property; all that is required is that the law should be put in force, which can only be by vigilance and courage in detecting offenders. I only find one case in the Calendar which has any refer to this subject, and that person, most fortunately for himself, was by the prompt exertions of a Magistrate arrested, perhaps before he had completed the offence. He will probably be prosecuted under some of the provisions of what is called the Black Act, an Act passed to repress certain enormities in the reign of George I. committed by persons armed and disguised by blacking their faces, and as prosecutions under this act are extremely rare, I take the liberty of pointing out to you the words of the Act, 'If any person or persons being armed with swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons, and having his or their faces blacked, or being otherwise disguised, shall appear in any forest, park, &c. *or in any high road*, and shall be convicted thereof, they shall be adjudged guilty, of felony.'

"Two circumstances it will be observed are necessary to constitute this offence, that the person should be armed, and should be disguised by having his face blacked, and in the present instance perhaps it will appear, but of this you will judge when the case comes before you, that this person was discovered before the offence was completed, and that only one of these circumstances can be proved against him; he was evidently on the verge of committing a capital felony, from which he was, perhaps fortunately for himself, witheld by being taken into custody. You will therefore inquire not only as to his person being disguised, but as to the fact of his being armed with offensive weapons, as swords, fire-arms, or other weapons, calculated to injure or terrify his Majesty's subjects. I have presumed to make these observations because a case of this kind may not have come before you, and in a statute so extremely penal there ought to be satisfactory grounds for putting a person upon his trial before another Jury, who in such case will have ultimately to decide upon his guilt or innocence.

..."

The Bill against James Shaw, of Leeds, clothdresser, charging him with having disfigured his person by blacking his face, and with being unlawfully armed with offensive weapons, was thrown out, by the Grand Jury, on Wednesday; and he was, of course, discharged without being put upon his trial.

JAMES SHAW, the man apprehended at Leeds on the night of Wednesday the 15th of January with his face disfigured, was last week liberated from York Castle without trial, the Grand Jury having thrown out the bill. His offence did not come under the provisions of the black act; which requires not only that the face of the offender should be blacked, but that he should also be armed with "swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons." It must not be supposed, from this acquittal, that the laws are unequal to the punishment of those who assemble for the destruction of the property of their neighbours. This would be a dangerous supposition, and might lead to most fatal consequences. The laws are fully equal to the punishment of the guilty—but this particular statute did not apply to SHAW'S case; and in a country where law is not made to bend to expediency, a prisoner will always enjoy the advantage of any such variation,between the charge and the offence, as the humane discrimination of the Judge enabled him on the present occasion to point out.

Hull Packet - Tuesday 05 May 1812

A person of the name of Haigh was apprehended at Methley on Saturday se'nnight, on suspicion of having been concerned in the late attack upon Mr. Cartwright's mill. This man, who appears to have received a wound from a musket-ball in his shoulder without being able to give any satisfactory account of the cause of that wound, has undergone several examinations before Mr, Radcliffe, of Milnsbridge, and was on Thursday committed to York Castle. On Thursday he passed through Leeds, in a chaise and four, on his way to York, escorted by twelve dragoons. Two other wounded men `[elsewhere (e.g. Pilot (London) - Tuesday 05 May 1812 ) named as "Charles Cockroft and one Stocks"; Stock (sic) was liberated, but Cockroft remanded.]` have been in custody all the week on a similar charge, but we have not heard the result of their examination.

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 12 May 1812

Committed la York Castle.— James Haigh, of Dalton, cloth-dresser, charged upon the oath of Joseph Ardron, and other persons, as strongly suspected of having been one of the persons who, on the night of the 11th of April, riotously assembled and attacked the mill of Mr. W. Cartwright, at Rawfolds. —This man was apprehended Methley, on Saturday week. It appears that since the attack above mentioned, he had been first at the house of a sister in-law, at Penistone, from whence he went to another sister at Methley. He was taken before Joseph Esq. of Milnsbridge, and after undergoing several examinations was fully committed on Thursday. He was conveyed to the Cattle in a chaise and four, escorted by a party of dragoons. —Two other men were apprehended as accomplices at Hill-House, near Huddersfield, on Monday evening, after several examinations, one of them named Stocks was liberated, but the other, Cockroft, was remanded.—On Monday night, it is strongly suspected, with a view to the rescue of the above men, the stable of Major Gordon, at Huddersfield, was set on fire, and nearly destroyed. The stratagem, however, failed; for instead of drawing away the guard which was placed over the prisoners, the officer, with great promptitude, doubled its force. Happily the fire did not communicate to any other building.

January 10 , EXECUTION OF THE LUDDITES AT YORK.

Precisely at eleven o'clock, on Saturday, the following persons suffered the sentence of the law due to their crimes, viz.—John Hill, Joseph Crowther, Nathan Hoyle, Jonathan Dean, John Ogden, Thomas Brook, and John Walker. The above persons behaved in the most penitent and contrite manner we have ever witnessed, placed in the melancholy situation in which they were. During the time the Ordinary was performing the functions of his duty, the repeated and earnest prayers of the culprits might be heard at a considerable distance, supplicating the Divine Being to receive their souls into everlasting rest. Many of them, after the Clergyman had repeated "The Lord have mercy upon you," in a very audible voice articulated "I hope he will." Previous to the Drop being let down, a Hymn was given out very firmly by John Walker, to his fellow-culprits, all of whom heartily joined in singing the same. The behaviour of the whole was truly becoming their awful situation, each of them expressing their sincere repentance for the crimes they had committed, and placing their only hope of Salvation through the merits of the Redeemer.—John Hill addressed the populace nearly in the following terms:—"I hope, my good Christians, you will take warning by the punishment you will see this day inflicted upon me and my fellow companions. I lived for a number of years in the possession of vital religion, but unfortunately the fascinations of the world gained an ascendancy over my mind, and I fell away from God and the paths of rectitude about a half a year ago. I want you, who now hear me, against the commission of mine, or any other crimes, which may subject you to the ignominious death I am now going suffer."

Half past One o'Clock.—The following prisoners, viz. John Swallow, John Batley, Jos. Fisher, W. Hartley, Jas. Haigh, Jas. Hey, and Job Hay, were executed at the time specified above. The whole of them evinced a spirit of contrition which we have seldom witnessed upon a similar occasion. The concourse of spectators, as at the former occasion, was numerous. James Haigh spoke to Mr. Lancaster, a gentleman residing in the West Riding of this county, at some length; he regretted the situation in which he was placed, and earnestly exhorted his fellow-sufferers to make their peace with God. James Hey said but little; however, he evinced, by his conduct on the Drop, a sincere and ??feigned repentance for the crime the laws of his country had subjected him to. John Swallow afterwards spoke to the populace in nearly the following terms:—"Ladies and Gentlemen, the situation in which I am now placed demands your serious consideration; being led astray by wicked and unprincipled characters, I was seduced from the paths of virtue, and fell into that dreadful time for which I am now going to suffer. I beg you to take warning by my fate, and I hope that God will grant you grace to live a life of sobriety and uprightness, in order to prevent your being brought to that situation in which I am now placed." The conduct of the prisoners was truly becoming their awful situation. The bodies were let down at half past two o'clock, and delivered to respective relations.
