JAMES SHAW, the man apprehended at Leeds on the night of Wednesday the 15th of January with his face disfigured, was last week liberated from York Castle without trial, the Grand Jury having thrown out the bill. His offence did not come under the provisions of the black act; which requires not only that the face of the offender should be blacked, but that he should also be armed with "swords, fire-arms, or other offensive weapons." It must not be supposed, from this acquittal, that the laws are unequal to the punishment of those who assemble for the destruction of the property of their neighbours. This would be a dangerous supposition, and might lead to most fatal consequences. The laws are fully equal to the punishment of the guiltyâ€”but this particular statute did not apply to SHAW'S case; and in a country where law is not made to bend to expediency, a prisoner will always enjoy the advantage of any such variation, between the charge and the offence, as the humane discrimination of the Judge enabled him on the present occasion to point out.
