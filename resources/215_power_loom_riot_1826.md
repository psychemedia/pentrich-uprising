RIOTS AT BLACKBURN

By the following letter received yestertday, from a highly respectable gentleman resident Blackburn, we are sorry to learn that want of labour, and the distress consequent thereon, have brought their usual concomitants: 

"Blackburn, April 24.  
Sir, I have just time before the Post leaves to inform you our town was thrown into great confusion this afternoon the arrival some thousand persons from the adjacent districts, where they had been destroying all the power looms. Several hundreds of the nioh were armed with pikes, a few with fire-arms, and nearly all the rest with bludgeons. They immediately proceeded to the works .Messrs, i!. Eccles and Co. where they forced the doors, and before the soldiers laid arrived hud broken all the power looms, as well the implements connected with them ; and although the spinning factory adjoins premises, and some the rooms occupied with spinning machinery, attempt was made to destroy single article connected with that department, not even the windows the buildings. After this scene mad devastation the mob immediately proceeded to the works of Mr. Moghtoa, where they completely destroyed all the power loom machinery. The Riot Act was read three times, and the soldiers dispersed the mob, and received voUies of stones, which were thrown at them, with great forbearance. One follow shot at a soldier, but the ball missed him, and entered the hack of man standing near. Several persons were wounded, but Ido not hear that any lives have been lost. great number of the pikes, and other destructive weapons ere taken from the mob by Mr. Hue the Constable, and the soldiers. Six the most active leaders were taken before the Magistrates, and committed for for further examination. Many additional Special Constables have been sworn in, and the streets are now, I am happy to sav, perfectly quiet, but the soldiers remain under arms, ready at moment’s notice. The shops were instantly shut, hut the rioter-, infonned the shopkeepers thev need not appro-' heusive, they would not harm them. In addition to the two mills mentioned, the mob destroyed the power looms, machinery, weft and twist, in use the works Messrs. Sykes, at Accrington ; .Messrs. Walmsley, at Rouf li. y ; Mr. Bury, at White Ash ; anil other places :c mentioned in the neighbourhood. I suppose t!. - hiss will amount to many thousand pounds, and 1 grc.it! fear it will not only throw those out employ connected with the factories which have been destroyed, but that it will the means of causing such a panic throughout the trade/ prevent many thousands the hand loom weavers from being re-engaged The weavers labour under a delusion, by supposing the origin of their distress to lie the use of machinery, and the destruction in the present instance so much machinery, they conceive will power loom weaving, and thereby remedy the evil, but they are mistake!!, for it more than probable, that it will tend to impoverish these districts, by driving the manufacturers to other parts, (as was the case some years ago the spinners) where thev can carry their trade unmolested. I think that very few the mob belong t » Blackburn. They came marching into the town with their glittering pikes shouldered, and the appearance generally was very alarming. The mob was so numerous, that it impossible to form a correct idea as to the number. I am, t>ir, your’s, O. S."

TO DO

THE RIOTS

It is this week our painful duty to record a series of riotous and lawless proceedings which have taken place in this town and neighbourhood, by which public tranquillity has been interrupted, and property to a considerable amount wantonly destroyed. At Rochdale they have led to still more disastrous consequences. In that town several lives have been sacrificed, and a number of individuals have been more or less injured, in a criminal attempt to arrest the course of justice. Though wicked and designing men most probably have been the instigators of these outrages, the present circumstances of the working classes are but too well calculated to make them listen to any counsel which premises them an alleviation of their distress. And deeply as we may deprecate the unlaw- ful proceedings wliich we have to detail, we cannot help making some allowance for men labouring under the extremes of want and wretchedness. Their hostility is directed chiefly against power-looms, to the cheaper productions of which they attribute the low rate of wages paid for hand-loom weaving. That the very general application of steam to weaving has mate- rially contributed to diminish the value, and consequently to lower the price of hand-loom weaving, can- not be denied; for though the high price of power- cloth at one time allowed the manufacturers of inferior goods still to give their weavers a fair remuneration for their labour, the present price of the former is so low, that the manufacturers of hand-loom clotii have been compelled to reduce the wages of their weavers, until they are no longer equal to their subsistence. The great cause of the low rate of wages, however, is over-production. For many years past, even in the most prosperous times, the supply has exceeded the demand; and therefore the smallest diminution of the latter has occasioned an accumulation of stock, a consequent reduction of price, and this, as its consequence, a reduction of wages. Diminished wages compel the weaver to produce more goods, and diminished profits urge the manufacturer to make more. The principle upon which trade is now conducted is to make large returns for small profits, and it is perhaps of little conse- quence to the manufacturer if he clear a thousand pounds, whether he make it by the sale of five thousand pieces, or of fifty thousand; but it is of vast importance to the weaver whether, to earn ten shillings, he shall work for a week or a fortnight. The principle which regulates his master's transactions ought not to apply to him. Let him be ever so industrious, there is a limit to human exertion; and when we see a man make thirty yards of cloth in one day, and continue that labour six days in the week, we may fairly pre- sume that we have seen the utmost effort of human labour at the loom. Then comes the question of remuneration. We are continually told that to meet the competition of other countries we must produce our goods on the very lowest terms. We much doubt, however, whether this continual reduction of wages, for the purpose of maintaining our superiority in foreign markets, has done much service to our foreign trade. It certainly has not diminished foreign competition, for that is daily increasing. Its only effect appears to have been to force the manufacturers of other countries to make corresponding reductions in the wages of their workmen, or to induce their govern- ments to multiply restrictive duties. And what has been its effect upon our unfortunate weavers? It has reduced them to a state of actual starvation. In a late number we stated, on good authority, that there were numerous families whose earnings, by their labour, did net exceed 13d. per week for each individual; in the district in which Colne and Burnley are situated, it is estimated that there are 50,000 persons whose means of obtaining subsistence, including what they receive from their respective parishes, do not exceed ls. (id. per week. Such are the fruits of foreign com- petition ! We do not mean to underrate the import- ance of a trade with otlier countries ; but we conceive its value to depend upon the remuneration it yields to the merchant, the manufacturer, and the labourer. Now it appears, that though the value of the exports of British manufactures, has increased in official value, since 1820, in round numbers, from 38 to 52 millions, the real and declared value remains nearly the same ! The exports of 1818 present a still more remarkable contrast with those of 1828, particularly in cot- ton manufactures. These, in the former year, amounted, according to official valuation, in round numbers, to rather more than twenty-two and a half millions, and according to their declared value, to upwards of eighteen and a half millions. Last year their official value amounted nearly to twenty-nine millions, while their real value had fallen to thirteen and a half millions ! Thus, it appears that the more we extend our foreign trade, the less profitable it is to the country. We shall be told, probably, of changes in the value of the currency, and in the price of the raw material; but these circumstances will account only for a small portion of the difference in these returns. The altered circumstances of the labouring population is the best proof the fatal tendency of the practice of forcing a foreign trade. At the period with which we compare the present, the weavers were well paid. They had the means of obtaining all the neces- saries, and most of the comforts of life. At the present moment they are suffering under the most distressing privations, not merely of the comforts and conveniences, but of the first necessaries of life.

RIOT OF THE POWER LOOM WEAVERS

The public will be pretty generally awatre, from the notices which have appeared in Our columns at various times, that for soma time past t here has bean a turn-out of the weavers emuployed at. the factory of Mr. Guest, at Holt Town, owing to an alleged reduction of prices. Numbers of his old hands have at various times assem. bled at his mill, to annoy and induce the workmen who had succeeded them in their situations to leave their em- ploy also, but no disposition has, up to yesterday, been evinced to commit an open breach of the peace. Yes- terday minsingm , heowevei, a number of persons assem. bled in ManChester, and going to the factory of Mr. Jordan, at Knot Mill, induced the hands employed at nearly 500 looms to quit their work, for the purpose of joining them in procession to Holt Town. With this rein- forcenieot they proceeded through the town, calling at several of the mills for a similar purpose, but owing to the precautions taken by the millowners, who had received notice of their intention, they were in several instances defeated in their object. They were neesmarilv delayed bv these means in their march, and Mr.Thomais, depity. constable, having received information that it was their intention to destroy Mr. Guest's mill, immediately col- lected all the disposable force of the police-office, con- sisting of olicemen Smith, M'Mullin, Kay, Norris, Pattinson, Irwin, Howarth, Wovenden, Lomas, Sickel, and Armitage, and dispatched them in advance of the procession to the mill in question, for its protection. rihis was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; and soon afterwards he called out three divisions of spe- cial constables, to aid themn, He then communicated with Colonel Wemyss and the magistrates, who believirg there was need for prompt assistance to support the civil force, a squadron of the 4th dragoons and several com. panies of infantry were called out, and also succeeded in arriving at Holt lown before the weavers. With such a force as this in view it might have been F-upposed that the individuals composing the procession, amounting to 600 of 700, would not have attempted any disturbance, hut on their arrival, however, acting under the direction of a man named Doyle, president of the Power Loom Weavers' Union, they took up a position immediatel in front of the mill, Here Doyle was busily marshal ing them in order, when the police, seeing be was making himself Particularly active, immediately took him into custody. This was the signal for a shower of stones upon the officers, and Smith was struck by several of them, but not severely hurt. Policeman Oakes was also struck by a brickbat, The police, nothing daunted, faced their assailants, and rushing upon them in a body they gave way, and retired to some brick.kilns at a short distance roims the mill, in a field at Bewick. Two men named Thomas Asnderstns and Thomas Westlwed, and ia WIoman named Bridget MPatstliny, were subsequenty apprehended for having thrown stones. in the mes time Mr. Thomas, deputy.constable, followed the weavers into the field, and mounting one of the stacks of bricks at the kilus addressed the assemblRge, urgpg them by no means to suffer themselves to be incite o actsof via- lance. A number of voices shouted at once, "No we won't, Mr. Thomas, we don't want a disturbance; all we want is juatice." Mr. Thomas said he hoped such was the case, but reminded them how liable t ey were when assembled is such numbers, to be exeited to scts which, individually, they might not at first have intended. C Not the slightest molestation was offered to him, the men gathering round him in good feeling, and cheering him. They were afterwards addressed to the same effect by Col.Wemyss. They remained there, however, duvng the day, and sent a deputation to Mr. Guest, requiring him to discharge one of his overlooeers named Smith, together I with all his new hands, and stating that his old workmen would return'at an advance of one penny per cut on the prices he had given before. These terms were not ac- cepted. All was peaceable during the remainder of the afternoon, however, but a fear existing that when the other mills loosed the hands would flock up to HoltTown, the militarv were kept under arms. This was not the case, and by ten o'clock last night most of the workmen had dispersed, and left the neighbourhood of the mill.
