RIOTS AT BLACKBURN

By the following letter received yesterday, from a highly respectable gentleman resident Blackburn, we are sorry to learn that want of labour, and the distress consequent thereon, have brought their usual concomitants:

"Blackburn, April 24.  
Sir, I have just time before the Post leaves to inform you our town was thrown into great confusion this afternoon by the arrival of some thousand persons from the adjacent districts, where they had been destroying all the power looms. Several hundreds of the mob were armed with pikes, a few with fire-arms, and nearly all the rest with bludgeons. They immediately proceeded to the works of Messrs, B. Eccles and Co. where they forced the doors, and before the soldiers had arrived had broken all the power looms, as well the implements connected with them; and although the spinning factory adjoins the premises, and some of the rooms occupied with spinning machinery, no attempt was made to destroy a single article connected with that department, not even the windows of the buildings. After this scene of mad devastation the mob immediately proceeded to the works of Mr. Hoghton, where they completely destroyed all the power loom machinery. The Riot Act was read three times, and the soldiers dispersed the mob, and received vollies of stones, which were thrown at them, with great forbearance. One fellow shot at a soldier, but the ball missed him, and entered the back of man standing near. Several persons were wounded, but I do not hear that any lives have been lost. A great number of the pikes, and other destructive weapons were taken from the mob by Mr. Rae the Constable, and the soldiers. Six of the most active leaders were seized, and taken before the Magistrates, and committed for further examination. Many additional Special Constables have been sworn in, and the streets are now, I am happy to say, perfectly quiet, but the soldiers remain under arms, ready at a moment's notice.

"The shops were instantly shut, but the rioters informed the shopkeepers they need not be apprehensive, as they would not harm them. In addition to the two mills mentioned, the mob destroyed the power looms, machinery, weft and twist, in use in the works of Messrs. Sykes, at Accrington; Messrs. Walmsley, at Rouf Hey; Mr. Bury, at White Ash; and other places are mentioned in the neighbourhood. I suppose the loss will amount to many thousand pounds, and I greatly fear it will not only throw those out of employ connected with the factories which have been destroyed, but that it will be the means of causing such a panic throughout the trade, as to prevent many thousands of the hand loom weavers from being re-engaged.

"The weavers labour under a delusion, by supposing the origin of their distress to be the use of machinery, and the destruction in the present instance of so much machinery, they conceive will prevent power loom weaving, and thereby remedy the evil, but they are mistaken, for it is more than probable, that it will tend to impoverish these districts, by driving the manufacturers to other parts, (as was the case some years ago with the spinners) where they can carry on their trade unmolested.

"I think that very few the mob belong to Blackburn. They came marching into the town with their glittering pikes shouldered, and the appearance generally was very alarming.

"The mob was so numerous, that it is impossible to form a correct idea as to the number.

"I am, Sir, your's &c., "O. S."

*From the Second Edition of the Manchester Mercury.*

Mercury Office, Tuesday morning.

We feel extreme regret in submitting to our readers the following detail which we have collected from various sources, with as much regard to accuracy as circumstances have rendered possible.

Yesterday forenoon a very large assembly of weavers took place on a hill at Henfield, a place where the four roads, leading to Blackburn, Burnley, Whalley, and Haslingden, meet. After remaining some time, a very large body proceeded to Accrington, the place where some indications of riot occurred this day week. Amongst the mob there assembled, there was a large body, not less, it is asserted, than 500, who were armed with pikes, or, to speak more correctly, knives and pieces of iron, ground sharp, and fastened at the end of sticks; some carried scythes, others had large sledge hammers, and a few had pistols and guns. The messenger who had been despatched to Blackburn for military aid had not returned, when, about twelve o'clock, the mob proceeded in a rapid but deliberate manner to Messrs. Sykes's new mill, which they immediately broke open, and in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes completely demolished the power-Iooms, sixty in number, with the dressing machines and other apparatus, and the warps and cloth in the looms. They likewise greatly injured the throstles and the steam-engine. The shops of the provision dealers were almost cleared of their contents. From this place they proceeded to a place called Wood Nook, where there were about twenty looms; these likewise they destroyed. They then went to Mr. Benjamin Warrmsley's at Rough Hey, where also they broke twenty looms, and did considerable other damage; they did not, however, do any wilful injury to thel spinning part of the machinery. From Rough Hey they proceeded to Mr. J. Bury's at White Ash, where they destroyed sixty or eighty looms. Such was the rapidityof their operatiops, that it was not until they had gone to this place, that the first account of the rioters having actually proceeded to violenes reached Blackburn. A party of the Queen's Bays immediately set out for White Ash, but the work of destruction had been completed before their arrival. A second demand for military aid had been sent from Accrington; the first, sent when no rioting had actually taken place, not having been attended to.At length 18 of the dragoons were dispatched, and on their way to Accrington they met and passed through a large body— the most moderate estimate we have heard says five or six thousand — of the rioters, who were then proceeding to Blackburn, having broken all the looms at White Ash. They did not, it is stated, appear to be at all intimidated by meeting the military, but carried their pikes, &c. openly, and in a very menacing manner. On entering Blackburn, a large number, from a body of 4 or 500, entered the Bay Horse Inn, a market-bouse, demanding bread and beer. The landlady, with some difficulty, got her doors closed, after having distributed a considerable quantity of liquor and all the bread she had in the house amongst those who had come in; they then rejoined their companions in the streets, and proceeded on without doing any further injury.

TO DO

 The next place which the mob visited wasthe extensive power loom factory of Messrs. Bannister, Eccles, and Co. in Durtven. street, Blackburn, where they arrived shortly after three o'clock. A party of dragoons was here as soon as themselves; but suds species of force could be of little or no avail in checking their proceedings. They could not prevent them ftom entering the factory; and therefore, still less could they prevent the destruction of the obnoxious machinery it contained. Mr. Eccies, we understand, met them at the door of his mill, and endeavoured to prevent them from entering it, but a pike was immediately put to his breast. He was told that they did not wish to do him any harm, but the destruction of his looms they were determined on. It was at this place that the soldiers and the mob first came into collision. ?? formvr were most violently stoned by the latter, who were themselves screened from. attack, and one soldier was considerably hurt. Some fire-arms also were discharged by the mob. In consequence, the Riot Act was read about half-past three o'clock; one or two soldiers, we believe, Bired their pistols,. and one of the rioters received a ball: and was slightly wounded in the' back. The whole of Mr. Eccles's power looms and dressing machines were reduced to a complete wreck; the warps and cloth on the beams were also destroyed, but no injury was done to the spinning machinery. While the mob were at this place, our informant saw a poor fellow lie down before the feet of the soldiers' horses; he said that they might trample upon thin c if they liked; he was starving to death but he would persist in breaking the power looms. Froma Messrs. Eccles and Co.'s the rioters proceeded t9 the mill beloeging to MMessrs. Fielden, Throp, and Toknley-, in King-street. which was intended to have con- tained power-looms; but none having yet been set up, they departed without committing any violence. A party, however, proceeded to Mr. Houghton's9 at Grirnshaw Park (whither also scome of the dragoofis were detached), where there were about 2G looms. Notwithstanding the presence of the soldiers, they effected an entrance into the building, entirely destroyed the looms and threw the twist, the warps, and beams on which they were wound, into the canal. At this place also the soldiers were severely pelted with stones, and in some instances were fired oe. A portion of them, consequently, dkclargred their fire-arms, and one rioter in the building is stated to have been shot dead. Another man was shot through the ear, the ball coming out of his mouth, and another was so desperately shot in the back, there is said to be no chance of his recovery. Altogether it is supposed that two or three lives were lost, and four or five poor creatures very seriously or dangerously wounded. The devastation at Mr. Houghton's terminated the lawless proceedings of the Rioters yesterday terminated them, however, when not a single power-loom was left standing in Blackburn, or within six miles of it. A very large number of people, it is said not less than 10,000, kept parading the streets of Blackburn in the evening, and displayed so much excitation, that it was deemed necessary to read the Riot Act twice. About eight o'clock the ?? were ordered to clear the streets, which they did, by striking with the flat edges of their swords; but in no instance, we believe, inflicting personal injury. Indeed, our information leads us to believe, that the coolness, temper, and humanity displayed by the military throughout the trying circumstances in which they were placed, were most exemplary.
 
 LATER ACCOUNT. (From a S92eod Edition of the Manchester Journal of Tuesday.) Our fears as to the result of the meeting between Blackburn and Burnley have unfortunately been realized. Yesterday morning several thousand persons having collected at Henfield, they proceeded in a body to Messrs. Sykes's factory, at Accrington, where they demolished all the, steam-looms, and damaged the engine, and meeting with no opposition, they also carried the work of destruction into the factories of Mr. MWalmesley, and Bury and Co. Our correspondent informs us, that their proceedings struck terror every where, as many of them were provided with fire-arms and pikes. On going into a factory, they first fired a pistol, and then gave three hchers, after which the demolition commenced, during which an armed guard marched round the place to prevent interruption. When they had finished the destruction of looms at Accrington, they proceeded towards Blackburn, and in passing over Standhill Moor, they marched in regular military order. In passing Foxhill Bank, a number of them stopped, and exacted bread and cheese from Mr. Simpson's family. The mob arrived at Blackburn about six in the evening, and proceeded immediately to the factory of Messrs. Bannister, Eccles, and Co., where they demolished the looms in the most deliberate and systematic manner. A troop of thirty soldiers were called out, but there being no magistrate present till the destruction of the machinery was nearly completed, they were at a loss how to act. Indeed the force of the mob was so overpowering, and they showed so much regular discipline, that any attempt at force would only have exposed the soldiers to certain destruction. The officer on duty, who had often witnessed the disorderly tumult of an Irish mob, is said to have been much struck with the cool deliberate manner in which the rioters wevnt about their unlawful purpose. Having, in about forty minutes, completely demolished the machinery, they proceeded towards Grimshaw-Park, levying contributions on the provision shops as they passed. Six men, who lingered behind in the factory, were taken into custody. Amongst the factories which were expected to be attacked is that of Messrs. Garnett and Horsfall, at Clitheroe. These gentlemen have been for some time accumulating fire-arms, in order to be prepared for any attack; and we understand, that at a very early hotty this morning a troop of horse marched from the barracks here to assist in protecting the factories at Clitheroe, so that there, it may be presumed, the rioters will meet with a check to their ill-directed violence. The amount of damage done, we have heard stated, by a gentleman who is qualified to judge, is not less that 10,000*l.*

RIOTS IN THE COUNTIES OF LANCASTER AND YORK.

TO DO

In ia Second Edition of the Leeds Mercury of last week, we communicated, substantially. the following information, collected on the spot, relating to the extensive outrages which have pretaileci, partly in thle County of York, but principally in the neighbouring County of Lancaster, and which have agitated every part of the Kingdom. After the excesses which occurred in Blackburn and the nelghbourhood, on Monday the 25th and Tuesday the 26th ult. the rioters proceeded into the other parts or the hasodresi of Blackburn, and( carried on their depredations in the power-loom factories In the whole line of country between Blackburn and Bury.

BLACKBURN AND BURY.

On Wednesday morning, a very large number of persons, chiefly from the nmcighsbourhosids of Tlasliagdlen and Newe-chureh, attacked the factory of Messrs. Thomas Whitchend ausd Brothers, at Raztsenesotall, nsear Edlen- field; where they dentroyui 'alt the power-looms, tfll In nusober. They then proceeded to Lotio OIoCs, where they destroyedi 20 in the factory of Mr. Kisy, and three hit that of Mr. Hobyle. They afterwards went to the factory of Messrs. L. and J. ftostrou, of DEARDNnr-esoos,010 where they broke 56 looms. So far the rioters had proceeded us their lawless career, withsout opposition or interruption, but its their next essteerrizr, a dulterent fate eswattedi them. Intelligence of use comineneement of their proceedinsgs having been conveyed to the military who were guarding the extensive establishment of Messrs. Ashitorna of lAWSanOTTsAMa, a party of about fourteen ejfloetne, and about the same number of dragoons, under the coommand of Col. Kearney and MAJee Ecltersley, tet out fisscaerh of thens, eccompassied by Wm. Grant, Esq. They proceeded to the factory of.Mr..

In coase s querrce, several of tre magistrates, amontgst whom were htesirse No rris, as Brierloy, and Foster, proceeded rnbaut secen 'clock, towvrds.GreAt. in Amncoats street, where, in half an hour afterwards, thv rliotat vwas C read by hir. iriarcey, altia nlarge placard, stathig thatlthadqtbeen read, exihlbited.

A company of the Rocket Brigade reached Manchester on Friday X forenoon, and the Clheshire Yeomanry, two hundred strong, arrived V about half past two In the afternoon. The former, we are sorry to say, n were severely peltedi with stones in the neighbourhood of the New Cross.

Only one disturbance of any consequence has taken place since Saturday; this was on Tuesday night, when about two hundred persons proceeded to New Islington, and broke the windows of Messrs. Johnonn & d Co.'s mill, and avowed a determination to destroy the power-looms it contains. They commenced their work with the endeavour to force a passage In with large stones, with which they broke the window-frames. However, a resolute watchman on the premises proved worthy of his trust; and, determined to defend his employer's property, he fired his blunderbuss, and hit one of the most forward of the assailants in the belly with a charge of swan shot. This dismayed the rioters, and they il retreated. The wounded man was carried to the Infirmary, where he still remalns in great danger of his life, which he has thrown away without the shadow of an excuse; for it seems he is not a weaver out of employ, but a cotton spinner, who either had or might have had work, and was resident in Lad-lane, at least two miles from the place where he provoked the ecil which has fullen upon him. The Second Blattallon of the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards, f and the f3d Regiment of Foot, are now on their way (per canal, night and day) to this town, where their arrival may be almost momentarlly expected. They will be quartered tls Lancashire till the really distrested n rioters are convinced of the folly of their 1idt proceedings, and the wicked who have attempted to make profit of it, that the law is too strong for crime.

OLDHAM. b 2Vu7srsday, May 4.-At an early hour on Sunday morning. a large number of persons assembled on Tandle Hill, near Misdleton. After remaining there until about ilne so'cock. they left the hill in a body, and proceeded to the mill of Mr. John Clegg, of High Crompton; where they demanded Admittance; and being refused, began to break the windows. The proprietor of the mill then opened the door for them; when they went in, and destroyed twenty-nine fustian-looms. A part of them then proceeded to the factory of Messrs. Ithine, Travis, and es Milne, at Shaw, but, fortunately, before their arrival, a few stout fellows, in Messrs. Milne & Co.'s employ, had assembled at the spot, and (though entirely unarmed) opposed their esitraiicere effectually; that i the rioters desisted from the attempt, and dispersed. ' C ' trillliuii6e'1af these pracanllhnga ?? heen conveyed t to Manchester, tih I1st Rocket Troop, and a squadron of Cheshire Yeomanry, set p osit immediately in search of the rioters: but, after pasalor through the country in which they had been carrying on their operations, and finding nothing, they returned to Manchester. About three o'clock on Monday, an alarm was brought to Oldham that another assembiage of persons had taken place upon T??ndle Hill; and that they had again moved towards the factory at Shaw. The Oldham Yeomamy Immediately turned out, and marched to Shaw: but, on their arrival there, they learned that the rioters had passed Shaw, and proceeded towards Greenacres Moor, where, together with many other persons, they had assembled round the factory of Messrs. Collings and Lancashire, but did not venture to make any attack upon it; knowing, probably, that the ?? had armed their work-people. On the arrival of the Yeomanry, the Rev. John Holme, who accompanied them, read the Riot Act, and the mob gradually dispersed, without having done any mischief. We believe that all the mitts coistaiing power-looms, in the neighbourhood of Oldham, are now put in a state of defence, so that if they should be attacked, the rioters will have reason to repent their temerity.

CLITHEROE. AlMu 4-There hne been no attempt upon the Low Mills since the visit of the rioters from Colne and Burnley, on Monday and Tuesday E week, 'ihese premises are now guardedby a company of the ?? Rife C Corps, a party of the Iet Dragoons from Leeds, nitd a strong body of h zealnus asd well-armed wusrkmen. Early on Saturday moriting last, a the Itith Ilstant, in consequence of some misinformation, the alarm was given that a large body of people was approaching the mill, when the military immediately turned tout, and the workmen rose from their beds, but after remaining under arms for some time, and patroling the roads in the neighbourhood, it was discovered that the alarm was uni- feuniled. t The following caution has been issued to the inhabitants:- t s' CAUTION-The Magitrates earnestly desire the Inhabitants of Clitheroe, in the event of a riot, or the assemblage of the mob, to keep themselves and families within their dwelling-houses, and their doors and shop windows closed.-iMlaV I." BOLTON. C t May 4-_Though there are a great number of power looms in this town, ?? has taken place. Groups of people have collected in this town, as to all the manufacturing towns of the county, but the public peace has not been interrupted, though the local force of the place, the Bolton Yeomanry, have mustered and been under arms during the whole of the last and the present week.

THE RIOTS

It is this week our painful duty to record a series of riotous and lawless proceedings which have taken place in this town and neighbourhood, by which public tranquillity has been interrupted, and property to a considerable amount wantonly destroyed. At Rochdale they have led to still more disastrous consequences. In that town several lives have been sacrificed, and a number of individuals have been more or less injured, in a criminal attempt to arrest the course of justice. Though wicked and designing men most probably have been the instigators of these outrages, the present circumstances of the working classes are but too well calculated to make them listen to any counsel which premises them an alleviation of their distress. And deeply as we may deprecate the unlawful proceedings wliich we have to detail, we cannot help making some allowance for men labouring under the extremes of want and wretchedness. Their hostility is directed chiefly against power-looms, to the cheaper productions of which they attribute the low rate of wages paid for hand-loom weaving. That the very general application of steam to weaving has materially contributed to diminish the value, and consequently to lower the price of hand-loom weaving, can- not be denied; for though the high price of power- cloth at one time allowed the manufacturers of inferior goods still to give their weavers a fair remuneration for their labour, the present price of the former is so low, that the manufacturers of hand-loom clotii have been compelled to reduce the wages of their weavers, until they are no longer equal to their subsistence. The great cause of the low rate of wages, however, is over-production. For many years past, even in the most prosperous times, the supply has exceeded the demand; and therefore the smallest diminution of the latter has occasioned an accumulation of stock, a consequent reduction of price, and this, as its consequence, a reduction of wages. Diminished wages compel the weaver to produce more goods, and diminished profits urge the manufacturer to make more. The principle upon which trade is now conducted is to make large returns for small profits, and it is perhaps of little conse- quence to the manufacturer if he clear a thousand pounds, whether he make it by the sale of five thousand pieces, or of fifty thousand; but it is of vast importance to the weaver whether, to earn ten shillings, he shall work for a week or a fortnight. The principle which regulates his master's transactions ought not to apply to him. Let him be ever so industrious, there is a limit to human exertion; and when we see a man make thirty yards of cloth in one day, and continue that labour six days in the week, we may fairly pre- sume that we have seen the utmost effort of human labour at the loom. Then comes the question of remuneration. We are continually told that to meet the competition of other countries we must produce our goods on the very lowest terms. We much doubt, however, whether this continual reduction of wages, for the purpose of maintaining our superiority in foreign markets, has done much service to our foreign trade. It certainly has not diminished foreign competition, for that is daily increasing. Its only effect appears to have been to force the manufacturers of other countries to make corresponding reductions in the wages of their workmen, or to induce their governments to multiply restrictive duties. And what has been its effect upon our unfortunate weavers? It has reduced them to a state of actual starvation. In a late number we stated, on good authority, that there were numerous families whose earnings, by their labour, did net exceed 13d. per week for each individual; in the district in which Colne and Burnley are situated, it is estimated that there are 50,000 persons whose means of obtaining subsistence, including what they receive from their respective parishes, do not exceed ls. (id. per week. Such are the fruits of foreign competition! We do not mean to underrate the importance of a trade with otlier countries; but we conceive its value to depend upon the remuneration it yields to the merchant, the manufacturer, and the labourer. Now it appears, that though the value of the exports of British manufactures, has increased in official value, since 1820, in round numbers, from 38 to 52 millions, the real and declared value remains nearly the same! The exports of 1818 present a still more remarkable contrast with those of 1828, particularly in cotton manufactures. These, in the former year, amounted, according to official valuation, in round numbers, to rather more than twenty-two and a half millions, and according to their declared value, to upwards of eighteen and a half millions. Last year their official value amounted nearly to twenty-nine millions, while their real value had fallen to thirteen and a half millions! Thus, it appears that the more we extend our foreign trade, the less profitable it is to the country. We shall be told, probably, of changes in the value of the currency, and in the price of the raw material; but these circumstances will account only for a small portion of the difference in these returns. The altered circumstances of the labouring population is the best proof the fatal tendency of the practice of forcing a foreign trade. At the period with which we compare the present, the weavers were well paid. They had the means of obtaining all the neces- saries, and most of the comforts of life. At the present moment they are suffering under the most distressing privations, not merely of the comforts and conveniences, but of the first necessaries of life.

RIOT OF THE POWER LOOM WEAVERS

The public will be pretty generally awatre, from the notices which have appeared in Our columns at various times, that for soma time past t here has bean a turn-out of the weavers emuployed at. the factory of Mr. Guest, at Holt Town, owing to an alleged reduction of prices. Numbers of his old hands have at various times assem. bled at his mill, to annoy and induce the workmen who had succeeded them in their situations to leave their em- ploy also, but no disposition has, up to yesterday, been evinced to commit an open breach of the peace. Yes- terday minsingm , heowevei, a number of persons assem. bled in ManChester, and going to the factory of Mr. Jordan, at Knot Mill, induced the hands employed at nearly 500 looms to quit their work, for the purpose of joining them in procession to Holt Town. With this rein- forcenieot they proceeded through the town, calling at several of the mills for a similar purpose, but owing to the precautions taken by the millowners, who had received notice of their intention, they were in several instances defeated in their object. They were neesmarilv delayed bv these means in their march, and Mr.Thomais, depity. constable, having received information that it was their intention to destroy Mr. Guest's mill, immediately col- lected all the disposable force of the police-office, con- sisting of olicemen Smith, M'Mullin, Kay, Norris, Pattinson, Irwin, Howarth, Wovenden, Lomas, Sickel, and Armitage, and dispatched them in advance of the procession to the mill in question, for its protection. rihis was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; and soon afterwards he called out three divisions of spe- cial constables, to aid themn, He then communicated with Colonel Wemyss and the magistrates, who believirg there was need for prompt assistance to support the civil force, a squadron of the 4th dragoons and several com. panies of infantry were called out, and also succeeded in arriving at Holt lown before the weavers. With such a force as this in view it might have been F-upposed that the individuals composing the procession, amounting to 600 of 700, would not have attempted any disturbance, hut on their arrival, however, acting under the direction of a man named Doyle, president of the Power Loom Weavers' Union, they took up a position immediatel in front of the mill, Here Doyle was busily marshal ing them in order, when the police, seeing be was making himself Particularly active, immediately took him into custody. This was the signal for a shower of stones upon the officers, and Smith was struck by several of them, but not severely hurt. Policeman Oakes was also struck by a brickbat, The police, nothing daunted, faced their assailants, and rushing upon them in a body they gave way, and retired to some brick.kilns at a short distance roims the mill, in a field at Bewick. Two men named Thomas Asnderstns and Thomas Westlwed, and ia WIoman named Bridget MPatstliny, were subsequenty apprehended for having thrown stones. in the mes time Mr. Thomas, deputy.constable, followed the weavers into the field, and mounting one of the stacks of bricks at the kilus addressed the assemblRge, urgpg them by no means to suffer themselves to be incite o actsof via- lance. A number of voices shouted at once, "No we won't, Mr. Thomas, we don't want a disturbance; all we want is juatice." Mr. Thomas said he hoped such was the case, but reminded them how liable t ey were when assembled is such numbers, to be exeited to scts which, individually, they might not at first have intended. C Not the slightest molestation was offered to him, the men gathering round him in good feeling, and cheering him. They were afterwards addressed to the same effect by Col.Wemyss. They remained there, however, duvng the day, and sent a deputation to Mr. Guest, requiring him to discharge one of his overlooeers named Smith, together I with all his new hands, and stating that his old workmen would return'at an advance of one penny per cut on the prices he had given before. These terms were not ac- cepted. All was peaceable during the remainder of the afternoon, however, but a fear existing that when the other mills loosed the hands would flock up to HoltTown, the militarv were kept under arms. This was not the case, and by ten o'clock last night most of the workmen had dispersed, and left the neighbourhood of the mill.
