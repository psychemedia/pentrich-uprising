Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 01 April 1817

Tuesday, April 1, 1817. The demoniacal infection engendered by the pestilence of the French Revolution, which has been festering here, in conscious impotence, through the progress of our national triumphs, to the arrival of the period when the dread of foreign subjugation has succumbed to the contemplation of pre-eminent independence— this malignant spirit, under the hypocritical affectation of commisserating the condition of the labouring and indigent class of the people, offering them an infallible remedy for their sufferings in the specious cant of reform, has been left to the present crisis to exert its hideous designs, and the exemplary and unremitting vigilance of our Constituted Authorities has brought to light a Conspiracy, ripening for execution on Sunday last, which has not its equal in our annals. The following statement; which is founded upon incontestible and irrefragable information, was communicated officially to the public on Saturday: "Manchester, 28th March, 1817' "THE MAGISTRACY and POLICE of MANCHESTER deem it their indispensable Duty to make known to the public, that Information, on which they can place the fullest Reliance, has reached them of a most daring and traitorous CONSPIRACY, the Object of which is nothing less than open Insurrection and Rebellion." Persons calling themselves Deputies, not only from the principal Towns in this District, but from others at a considerable distance, are known to be engaged in it. The Town of Manchester is one of the first pointed out for ATTACK, and the moment fixed upon for the diabolical Enterprize is the night of Sunday next, the 30th instant. "Every Measure of Precaution consistent with the Secrecy hitherto required has been already resorted to Means, fully adequate, it is hoped, to frustrate these horrid Machinations, have been adopted, and a large Military Force is already close at hand. Still, however, under the very alarming and pressing Circumstances attendant upon this TREASON, it is considered absolutely necessary to the personal security of the Inhabitants, by this Public Notice, to call upon them as Friends to their Country and themselves, to come forward immediately to evince the strong Abhorrence they entertain of such detestable PLOTS, and to shew to the Enemies of social Order, that neither Courage nor Power in wanting to resist and to overcome any Attack which may be made, however serious, or however sudden. "ELEVEN PERSONS have been this day apprehended at a Meeting of Deputies, the Time and Place of which Meeting have been known to the Magistrates and Police, and communicated to the Secretary of State, several Days ago. For the Apprehension of FIVE of these Deputies Warrants had already been received." In addition to the above important intimation, we owe it to the public to subjoin what particulars we have been able to collect upon the subject, and which we can rely on. We find the horrible plot was known immediately after the frustration of the petitioners' journey to London, or more familiarly speaking, the Blanket Expedition. Delegates from distant (chiefly manufacturing) towns, met frequently to discuss the plan of insurrection, which was fixed to have taken place simultaneously in all the appointed towns. About midnight on Sunday, the discharge of a rocket was to be the signal for the commencement of operations, when all the strangers flocking in from the different approaches to the town, were to make the best of their way to the old rallying point near Saint Peter's Church ; here the resident conspirators would be ready to receive them; they were then to separate in divisions, some to attack the Barracks, others the New Bayley, the Banks, the Police Office, the residences of our official functionaries, and certain other private houses. For the excision of our invaluable Deputy Constable, who was rated by them as worth a thousand men, a trap was to be laid to this effect; that upon the alarm being sounded, Mr. Nadin was expected to rush forth, when an individual, who had already undertaken the commission, would, with unerring aim, be ready to dispatch him. In fact, altogether such a direful and monstrous scene of commotion was hatching that is horrible for us to reflect upon. On Friday last, a meeting of these delegates took place at Ardwick; in the first place, at the Royal Oak, from whence they adjourned to the George and Dragon, where they were all apprehended, consisting of eleven men; of this number, two of them, a cotton-spinner and cooper, belonged to this town, of the rest there were not two that came from the same town. A party of the First Dragoons, assisted in escorting them to the New Bayley prison. On their way thither they seized a scissar-grinder, upon a warrant from the Secretary of State, and three others were afterwards taken into custody. On Saturday morning, five more were secured in the neighbourhood of Middleton, including Bamford, the Reform Delegate. On Sunday morning, eight of the prisoners, named as follow, were forwarded to London, viz— James Sellers, Robert Ridings, John Roberts, John Lancashire, Nathan Hilton, Edward O'Connor, Samuel Bamford and Healey. Part of the 13th Light Horse came in on Saturday, and also a part of the 54th Foot, and on Sunday a numerous body of the 85th Foot by a forced march from Warrington. A troop of Sir F. Leicester's Cheshire Yeomanry marched through here about half past seven o'clock on Sunday evening for Ashton-under-Line. Every measure of vigilance and precaution has been adopted that the urgency of the occasion demanded, and up to the present moment all is perfectly secure and tranquil. The arrangements, the decision, and the personal recommendations of Sir John Byng, Commander of the District, soar far above any eulogy we could attempt to give him. We are much concerned to hear, that some villain fired the contents of a loaded piece into the upper apartments of a most worthy inhabitant of Salford, (Mr. Burgess,) yesterday morning, a little before two o'clock. Fortunately he had not reached home, after the fulfilment his duty as constable, and no member bis family sustained any personal injury. Monday week, an inquisition was concluded before Mr. Milne, at the Coach and Horses in Deansgati, on the body of one Mary Birch, hurt the lower end of Bridgelstreet, by the Military on the 10th instant. It appeared the military were escorting some prisoners to the New Bailey Prison, and the poor woman was coming the street, and owing to the extreme pressure of the crowd, the deceased was knocked down, and rode against by a horseman—  Under all the circumstances the Jury, without hesitation, found a verdict: of" accidental death." The Coroner felt happy in ascertaining, that no charge of complaint could in the least degree attach to the soldier upon the unfortunate occasion. The new Bill to explain nnd amend the Act of the 48th of the present reign for repealing the Duties of Assessed Taxes, and granting new duties in lieu thereof, and to exempt such dwelling-houses as may be employed for the sole purpose of trade, or lodging goods, wares, or merchandise, from the duties charged, has been printed. It enacts, that tenements which have been occupied as dweU hng-houses shall not be charged the said duties when employed solely for the purpose of trade, nor when used as warehouses, provided no person inhabits or dwells therein except in the day-time only, and for the purpose of such trade. Such tenements, however, are to brought into assessment as dwelling-houses, but on notice tbat they are occupied solely and exclusively above, the assessor or surveyor, on finding the statement correct, is to discharge them from the assessment. A farmer of experience says, that the wheat plant never looked more promising at this season of the year than at present, between Bristol and Devonshire. The command of the S3d Regt. of Foot vacant the death of Sir J. Abercromby, is eiven Lord Hill, and the Sir Q. Murray. We learn that the Warden and Fellows of the Collegiate Church have it in contemplation to exact the discontinuance of funerals in the Collegiate Church-yard. Friday lasf, adjourned inquisition wa3 concluded before Mr. Milne, at Norris, the body of a man hurt by sabre on the 10th inst. The Jury, after examining Kreat variety of evidence, and being left alone, disagreed in their verdict, fourteen being of opinion was Wilful Murder against some person unknown, two them that the party was guilty of Manslaughter only. The Coroner, upon returning to them the recorded the verdict of twelve, whereby, minority sunk into the majority. The Coroner then observed he had on the occasion received nn anonymous letter, highly reproachful. He hoped the infatuation and delusion many persons laboured under would soon end, and that their own good sense would point out the undue influence that had been practiced upon them so subversive of every religious and moral duty, tending to distract Government, and ultimately ending in their own ruin. The forbearance ofthe militarywas highly commendable— they, the Magistrates, and Coustables not only participated in but did all their power to alleviate the distresses ofthe welldeserving, and he hoped and trusted upon every occasion as upon the late one, men would be found te resist the impel uous nnd to support the admirable. Constitution under which we liv^d.

ARRESTS AT MANCHESTER.

*Manchester, March 29.* — For some time past the better informed class of society here has reason to look with an eye of jealousy upon the state morbid quiescence into which the public mind had apparently sunk, since the prompt suppression of the last Meeting by the military. Rumour and conjecture have been very active; but knowledge of the real state of the case was strictly to those holding official situations. I refer to the Declaration of the Magistrates in our Papers of this day, for the circumstances which have occurred, so far as they are officially disclosed. I feel assured that you, Sir, will be little prepared for such a discovery, and that it will affect you deeply; and your feelings will be consonant with those of every on with whom I have this day conversed. By this time (four o'clock) the alarm has in a great degree, subsided; but every one is struck astonishment at the diabolical nature of the conspiracy, and at the secrecy with which it has been conducted. The eleven Deputies, mentioned in the Declaration having been apprehended, were assembled in a small public house on Ardwick-green, about one mile from the Exchange, seven more, in a cellar in Church-street, were apprehended under the same circumstances, and are now in custody.

All these People had their papers about them, but whether or not those papers were important, I have not learned, as the examinations have been private. Our active Deputy Constable, Nedin, has just now passed my window, escorted by a party of the first Dragoons, having, in a coach, five prisoners, whom he has taken up in Middleton, where similar measures had been contemplated. One them is Bamford, the Deputy from Middleton to London, at the late assembly of those worthies. Nedin observes, that so active and clever were the signals made from hill to hill, at Middleton, during his short visit, that neither he nor any of his party could comprehend them.

I will now endeavour to give you account of the plot which has occasioned so much temporary confusion;— The signal for commencement was a rocket, which was to have ascended from near St. Peter's Church. The factories in the outskirts were to have been destroyed by means of rockets, which were to be ejected from a long brazen instrument, which was formed to introduce them at the windows. These circumstances would naturally attract the civil and military force towards the outskirts, and the mob was then to have attacked the Banks, and ultimately the New Bailey and Barracks. This plot has extensive ramifications; Nottingham, Birmingham, Derby, and other considerable towns were to be attacked at the same time; I wish the Police of those towns may be as successfully active as ours has been. It is supposed that the eleven Deputies came from all parts of the country, and that they are men of some importance in their own way.

I am glad to tell you that this town is now most perfectly quiet; every precaution has been taken; the military force has been very considerably increased; we have already 2000 special constables; and the Watch and Ward Act will acted upon to-night.

*[From the British Volunteer and Manchester Weekly express. Saturday, March 29.]*  
Eight persons have been arrested within the last three days, under Lord Sidmouth's warrants, and they arrived in London under the care of proper Officers Monday. We understand, that in addition to the above, eight persons arrested under Lord Sidmouth's warrants, thirteen others have been arrested under warrants from the Magistrates, who have acted with the greatest decision and alacrity. The following is the circular front the *Court News Reporter*:—

"TREASON! SEDITION! REBELLION!

"The accounts we learnt at a late hour on Monday, are of most extraordinary and alarming nature from Manchester. We can only give as were informed. Government have been for some time in possession of information that a most diabolical plot was in contemplation to destroy the whole town of Manchester, the Magistrates, and a certain portion of the inhabitants by fire and other destructive means; the parties who were contrivers, and to be the perpetrators of this scheme, were known to the Magistrates and Police of that part of the county, at least some of them, and information of the parties was sent to the Secretary of State's Office against them, and the circumstances of their conduct amounting to nothing short of High Treason, and in consequence warrants charging the different parties with that offence were issued by Lord Viscount Sidmouth, his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, and made special to several King's Messengers, who were dispatched to Manchester to execute them. Upon their arrival in Manchester, they shared the fate which all strangers have done for some time, of being followed, watched or louted, as the slang term is among the dreadful and numerous combination, a whistle with the fingers in the mouth was the signal when stranger was discovered; and although Manchester is one of the largest towns in England, the operations of the rebellious were so well organized, that it is supposed that strangers were pretty well discovered, and their business ascertained. The determination of the combined parties was ascertained to be proceeding with so much violence and determination, that the Magistracy of that town thought it right openly to avow their knowledge of the mischief intended, by nothing less than acts of open rebellion, which they did by a public Proclamation, which was posted in different parts of that town, informing the Public that they had received information upon which they could rely, the object of which was nothing less than open insurrection and rebellion. Persons calling themselves Deputies had arrived in Manchester, not only from that district, but from numbers of other towns at considerable distance, who were engaged in a plot to attack different towns, but Manchester ?? - and the diabolical enterprise was to take place on Sunday. To counteract their designs, measures of precaution, consistent with the secrecy previously observed, had been made, and means had been prepared, it was hoped fully adequate to frustrate the horrid machinations which had been contemplated. A large military force was near the town. Notwithstanding these arrangements under the pressing and open circumstances of treason, the inhabitants, by the public notice for their personal security, were called upon to come forward immediately, to evince the abhorrence they feel at such detestible plots, and to prove their conduct to the enemies of social order, that neither courage nor power to resist, or to overcome any attack, which may be made, however serious or however sudden.

"This had the desired effect, together with numerous bodies of the military, horse and foot, poring in from all directions round the town; notwithstanding this formidable force, an attempt was made for the projected Meeting to be held in the open air, as announced, and persevered in, but they were dispersed, notwithstanding so determined were these mischievous persons, or at least those called Deputies, or Ringleaders, that they met in houses, and adjourned three times from house to house, in small numbers, to avoid discovery and detection; however, information of the Police, the official Gentlemen attending there from Government was so good, that all their movements were known, and eleven of them, the most violent and active, were apprehended. Five of them were Deputies from other Towns, and they were safely lodged in the New Bailey. This firm and resolute conduct of the Police, the Magistrates, and the agents, stopped the intended riotous proceedings, the numerous bodies of them dispersing, or, in fact, they were not allowed to assemble in numerous bodies. Saturday was employed in pursuing after some of the parties, against whom warrants had been issued, charging them with the crime of High Treason, and who were known to be principal movers in the arrangements making for the acts of open rebellion and destruction of Manchester, and the murder of one of the inhabitants, which were to be perpetrated Sunday night, but they had not dared to show themselves that day in Manchester, they having been dismayed in their diabolical projects, by the immense military force, and the arrangements made by the Magistrates to stop their proceedings. Dr. Joseph Heiley was apprehended at Middleton, about six miles from Manchester, while in the act of visiting his patients. Samuel Bamford was apprehended in the same neighbourhood. This man was in London in the month of December last, and attended at the Tavern Meetings of Delegates, we believe the King's Arms, in New Palace-yard, where he disputed with Cobbett, upon the question of Universal Suffrage. He is a young man, twenty-six years of age, of considerable abilities, writes poetry very fluently, and speaks it extempore. He has written lines on the Battle of Waterloo, which are spoken by Dr. Heiley with much effect. They were conveyed to Manchester and properly secured. The whole of the Traveller coach was engaged for Sunday, and eight of those apprehended were brought off by it for London on Sunday morning at six o'clock, double ironed, in the custody of two of the King's Messengers, and Mills and Platt the Police Officers of Manchester. They arrived on Monday at the Police Office in Bow-street, where their irons were knocked off, and they were ordered to be quite separate, and Officers appointed to guard them, and prevent their having any communication with each other. Their names, we understand to be James Sellers, John Roberts, Robert Kedeings, Sam. Bamford, John Lancashire, Dr. Jos. Heiley, Edward Connor, and Nathaniel Thulton. They are all of the lower orders, and extremely poor. John Lancashire can neither read nor write. They did not undergo any examination in the course of Monday."

Chester Chronicle - Friday 04 April 1817

Projected Insurrection at Manchester. is with feelings extreme horror we have to record the discovery of conspiracy the most. foul the human mind could conceive-— the most diabolical that the Prince of Darkness, with all his power over the mental faculties of the wicked, could instil into the hearts of his followers .'— There is so much of systim in the discovered plans, as to prove, beyond a doubt, that the plot was perfect in all its infamous ramifications.— lt
 was not in Manchester alone, that the explosion was threatened, altho' that town appears to be the grand seat of sedition, treason, and rebellion: Deptuties assembled there to represent the Jacobin malignants of other places; their deliberations were held in "solitary state and sullen Majesty," and the still season of night was fixed upon for the execution of their criminal designs.The plot had thickened, and all was ripe for the destruction of propeity and the extinction of life. Â¦ Come thick night And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes-; Nor Heav'n peep thro' the blanket the dark. To cry— Hold! Hold!—  How these machinations of the wicked were discovered, we are not told; but it appears that the Police of the Town had early information of the designs of the disaffected. Arrests have taken place, and a number of the Delegates have been dispatched to London.— And here let it be understood, that, in the few lines which precede this, not in any, the slightest, way implicate in our remarks the population of Manchester; an immense majority of which we know to be as loyal and devoted subjects as any in his Majesty's dominions: we merely allude to those incendiaries, who, taking advantage of a period of distress, almost unexampled, and certainly unavoidable, endeavour by insidious means to work upon the feelings the less enlightened. To these it is we allude; and we hope their punishment will be commensurate with their offence.— Following this are the particulars of the conspiracy, extracted from the Manchester Mercury. .The demoniacal infection engendered by the pestilence of the French Revolution, which has been festering here, in conscious impotence, through the progress our national triumphs, to the arrival of the period when the dread of foreign subjugation has succumbed to the contemplation of pre-eminent independence—  this malignant spirit, under the hypocritical affectation of commisserating the condition of the laboring and indigent class of the people, offering them an infallible remedy for their sufferings in the specious cant of reform, has been left to the present crisis to exert its hideous designs, and the exemplary and unremitting vigilance of our Constituted Autiorities has brought to light a Conspiracy, ripening for execution on Sunday last, which has not its equal in our anals. The following statement, which is founded upon incontestable and irrefragible information, was communicated officially to the public on Saturday: Manchester, 28 March, 1817. "the MAGISTRACY and POLICE MANCHESTER deem it their indispensable Duty to make known to the public, that Information, which they can place the fullest reliance, has reached them of a most daring and traitorous CONSPIRACY, the object of which is nothing less than open Insurrection and Rebellion.

Part of the 13th Light Horse came in on Saturday, and also a part of the 54th foot, and on Sunday a numerous body of the 85th foot by a forced march from Warrington. A troop of Sir J.F.

Fortunately he had not reached home, after the fulfilment of his duty as a constable, and no member of his family sustained any personal injury. Saturday morning last, about nine o'clock, in consequence of an order received from Sir John Byng, commander of this district, a strong body of the 85th regiment, marched from this garrison, on their way to Warrington, there wait for further orders.— They subsequently proceeded on to Manchester.— ln the afternoon of the same day, an order addressed the indefatigable Store-keeper of our Castle, W. M. Henderson, Esq. was. received, requesting him to dispatch, by the quickest mode of conveyance, ten thousand rounds of ball cartridge. — That gentleman instantly procured a coach, in which the ammunition was placed, and before 5 o'clock, escorted by four privates and a Serjeant of the 85th regiment, the vehicle left the Castle Yard for its destination.— These instances of Military activity prove that Ministers are determined to put down by force of arms, all future attempts of the malcontents to sow sedition and reap rebellion.

DARING AND TRAITOROUS CONSPIRACY!

At Manchester.

The demoniacal infection engendered by the pestilence of the French Revolution, which been festering in Manchester, in conscious impotence, through the progress of our national triumphs, in the arrival of the period when the dread of foreign subjugation has succumbed to the contemplation of pre-eminent independence;this malignant spirit, under the hypocritical affectation of commisserating the condition of the labouring and indigent class of the people, offering them an infallible remedy tor their sufferings in the specious cant of *reform*, has been left to the present crisis to exert its hideous designs, and the exemplary and unremitting vigilance of our Constitutional Authorities has brought to light a conspiracy, ripening for execution on Sunday week, which has not its equal in our annals - It is a fact that meetings Delegates from distant towns and districts hare met secretly to discuss the means of carrying their horrid measures into effect. The subsequent capture of the Delegates *in council assembled* on Friday se'nnight, has furnished the proof. It appears they had previously assembled at the Royal Oak, in Downling Street, Ardwick, from whence they adjourned to the George and Dragon, at Ardwick, where, about five o'clock, they were secured. Of the means by which the horrid treason was discovered, we pretend not to speak; but the intention of the conspiratora, and the plan of destruction, we can state with confidence to have been, a conjunctive consolidation of the disaffected from the neighbouring districts, last Sunday night week, when, on the arrival of the several detachments of men bent rebellion, at the several entrances into the town, they were to halt, till, at one o'clock, by a rocket to be fired, the signal should be given for the whole to make the best of their way to the ground they had previously occupied near St. Peter's Church, where the  leading conspirators resident in Manchester, were to be assembled in readiness ; for it was agreed from two to three thousand persons would he sufficient to begin the operations though they calculated on being joined by 40 or 50 thousand before day-light commenced. From the brickfield, the midnight muster was to be in motion by dvisions, and attacks were to have been simultaneously made on the BARRACKS, the NEW BAILEY PRISON, the POLICE OFFICE, the BANKS, and other PUBLIC OFFICES, all Places where ARMS were likely to be found, and the PRIVATE HOUSES of GENTLEMEN who had made themselves obnoxious to them, by adhering to their duty as men, as conscientious magistrates and Officers, and as Patriots. In short, a complete triumph of Rebellion orer Order was anticipated.

Gracious God! if Thy providence had not lent light to the Conservators of the public peace, what desolation had visited the streets! What blood would have flooded their sewers! In the midst of night to have been roused from the sleep of peaceful assurance, by congregated cries of MURDER! to the most horrible scene which can arise in the most-to-be-dreaded of all calamities, a civil war! - The heart sickens, overpowered by the picture, from which it recoils, whilst it imagines the threatened horrors which have been so happily averted? Hundreds, perhaps thousands of the inhabitants of Manchester and Salford owe the preservation of the lives and properties to the Magistrates and the Police; and Humanity has been spared the shock it would have sustained, If the rebellion had been allowed to come to a crisis, though a prepared resistance might have crushed at once, by a terrible example of blood, the hopes of the deluded wretches whom Treason has so long been instigating to measures which can only end in ruin. Had not the discovery of the plot been made public, but the military force had been privately stationed at the premeditated and well-known points of attack, many hundreds, perhaps thousands of the miserable fools of TREASON would have fallen, and paid with their lives the forfeit incurred by their crimes.— Humanity forbad the sacrifice— and we do trust so much in the latent, though unhappily of late the dormant virtue of too many of our bewildered fellow countrymen,— as to hope, that the mercy and forbearance they hare experienced by the development which has respited so many from dying in the very commission of the blackest crimes— who, in that state, reeking  hot in sin, must have rushed into the presence of their God— their Eternal Judge— will shake their souls to repentance— and from this time, instead of groaning beneath a load of chains with which they hare been bound by the tyranny of delusion, become worthy of the blessings of the free Constitution, the value of which, whilst they remain enervated by the slavery of sedition, they know not how to appreciate.

The paper published and placarded by order of the Magistrates, which appeared in our last, will inform our readers of the first precautionary proceedings. We shall now lay Before them such particulars of subsequent circumstances, as we can vouch for. On Friday evening the important facts they afterwards published, were laid by the Magistracy and Police, before a number of Gentlemen of the most respectable consideration in the town and neighbourhood, who could not but express their satisfaction on the silence which had been so properly observed, till every possible provision of prevention was taken, as well as to make sure the seizure of the delegates, whose meeting, it was anticipated, would take place on Friday, at Ardwick, from different places. One of whom, it may be right to notice, was resident in Derbyshire, and had repeatedly been Sent on missions from Manchester to some of the other largest manufacturing towns in the kingdom, doomed, it appears, to have partaken, like Manchester; of the fraternal embrace. During Friday night, and on Saturday, the Magistracy and Police continued on the alert, for much was to be done! In addition to the eleren deputies already mentioned, several other persons were apprehended. The locks were taken from the fowling-pieces, in the gunsmith's shops, and the gunpowder in the hands of the dealers in that dangerous article, was removed to a place of guarded Security; whilst the whole military force which could be spared, within marching distance, was added to the troops already stationed there. In the course of Saturday night, eight of the prisoners, vis. James Sellers, Robert Ridings, John Roberts, John Lancashire, Nathan Hilton, Edward O'Connor,Samuel Bamford, and a person well known at Middleton, by the distinction of *Doctor* Healley, were sent off to London, secured by fetters, and well guarded. On Sunday a strong detachment of the 85th regiment of foot came from Warrington, whence they had been sent by the patriotism of that town in boats. The Cheshire Yeomanry again evinced their patriotic attachment to good order, and the value which ought to be set that truly constitutional force, by their hastening the post of danger. The 84th Regiment of Foot, and the 1st Dragoon Guards, were, of course, on active service, the whole under the superintending eye of the Commander of the District, Lieut-Gen. Sir John Byng, whose conduct on this occasion, was, as well as on the 10th *ultimo*, when the blanket-men were stayed on their march, above all the praise which can bestowed! In the evening of Sunday, Mr. Nadin, who had rendered himself so obnoxious to the disaffected, that he was particularly mentioned as an object of sacrifice on the first burst of the plot, act off post for Sowerby, Yorkshire, where be bad learned, KNIGHT, one of the chief leaders of the self-named "Reformers," was concealed. He had, it seems, been incognita, for some time, but Mr. Nadin had the good fortune to secure him, and on Monday morning he lodged him in the New Baytey Prison.

The providential discovery of the horrid plot, prevented its execution. The wretched contrivers, who escaped the officers of justice, hid themselves from observance:—and —through most praiseworthy precaution, upwards of one thousand Special Constables paraded the streets during the night— and the infantry were on guard in different points; and the Cavalry were traversing the outlets of the town- Sunday night, however, passed over without any serious alarm.

A newly formed troop of Yeomanry Cavalry, at Huddersfield volunteered to take charge of that town and neighbourhood, to afford opportunity for the regular troops to proceed to Manchester, the point the infatuated meant to attack.
