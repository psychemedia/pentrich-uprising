Distressed Manufacturers.— We rejoice to bear that the Lord Mayor has announced his intention of giving a spiendid route at the Mansion House, the object of which is to assist the distressed manutacturers, particnlarly those concerned in the Spitalfields trade, 6000 of whom, it is confidently stated, are at present destitute of employment. A Committee of Gentlemen are about to undertake the Management of this benevolent plan, suggested by his Lordship. The Egyptian Hail, with all the other rooms in the Mansion-house, are intended to be thrown open on the occasion, and to be brilliantly illuminated with gas, for which purpose they are now preparing. The object of this entertainment is, that every idividaal present must wear, or bring with him, some newly purchased article of the Spitalfields mnanufacture.
