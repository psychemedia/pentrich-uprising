NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES. The business of primary interest at these assizes was the trials of James Croft and James Brawfield, for arson, and *Thomas Chettle* and *Thomas Glover*, for frame-breaking and burglary. The following particulars will convey a general idea of the leading facts, as they came out evidence.

...

John Chettle and Thomas Glover, *for frame-breaking*.— The prisoners were charged with having, on the night of the 8th of June last, at the parish of Radford, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling house of Wm. Wright, and therein broke and destroyed four lace frames, the property of the said Wm. Wright, and eight other frames in the same dwelling-house. They also stood charged with burglariously entering the said dwelling-house, and stealing two pieces of lace; and likewise with having, on the same night, in company with divers other persons, wilh force and arms, entered the dwelling-house of Thomas Mullen, in the said parish, and maliciously and feloniously broke and destroyed therein one lace frame, belonging to the said Thomas Mullen, and six other frames in the same dwelling-house. To these several counts the prisoners pleaded not guilty.— Wm. Wright and others, in their examination before the Court, bage an account of the breaking of the frames, between twelve and one o'clock the night mentioned in the indictment, by a party of men, in disguise, who made their way into the house, chopping the door with an axe, and forcing it open. The four lace frames were in full employ. Mrs. Waynman stated the extent of the damage sustained, including the lace pieces, at £263. — Ann Wright appeared as principal witness for the prosecution. She said, that she was in bed and was alarmed the noise of some persons chopping the door open: that in her fright she "screeted out murder!" She looked out of the window and saw Chettle and Glover, whom she had known for some time; that she distinctly recognised their features and dress, by the light of the moon, and of a candle which stood in the room. She was quite certain as to their persons. That she heard Chettle say, in his own natural voice, when the men were breaking open the door, " Now you may get in;" and in going through the house, he cautioned the rest, saying to them " mind, you are forgettinig your voices." The men were in the house about twenty minutes. On her cross-examination she admitted that she had told different stories about the matter, but that what she had before said was under the influence of fear.—The prisoners, in their defence, set up an *alibi*, which was supported by the testimony of a great number of witnesses. On the part of Chettle it was proved by a woman of the name Wacherley, or Waggerley, who had had children by him, that he was present with her, from 10 o'clock at night on the 8th of June, until two the next morning, in company with several other persons, who had met at a room, in Lamb's buildings, Broad Lane, in that town, to make merry on account of the return of her son, who had been just discharged from the army. J. Ash, —— Price, Frederick Wacherley, Jemima Hunt, Ann Jarvis, and another, who were of the party, corroborated this statement; which was further confirmed by Ann Dry and another, who inhabited adjoining rooms, and had seen the prisoner there at the several hours of one and two in the morning. All the witnesses agreed as to the prisoner being fresh in liquor, and that he had slept on a chair in the room from one to two hours. In addition to this, the wife of a person named Shaw, swore that she saw and spoke to Chettle, at her own door, in Back Lane, about 20 minutes past two in the morning; that he appeared quite fresh, and was going towards home, at New Radford. Witness had been washing and preparing her children's clothes, for them to go to the Sunday School in the morning, and she happened to go to the door at the moment Chettle was coming up the lane. Witness knew Ann Wright; but such was her character, that she would not believe any thing she said upon oath.— On the part of Glover, Mrs Cooper, her servant, and several olher persons swore, that he was sittng in the tap-room, at the Odd Fellows' Arms public-house, New Radford, in company with four or five more, who had been partaking of a beef steak with him, from half-past nine or ten o'clock at night of the 8th of June, till two the next morning, and that they never lost sight of him.

The Learned Judge (Graham), in summing up, made some pointed remarks the nature of the evidence brought forward in favour of the prisoners; when the Jury retired, and after consulting together some time, returned a verdict of *not guilty*.

As soon as the Jury had pronounced their verdict, loud shouts of approbation were set up by the crowd assembled in and about the hall.

The trial lasted thirteen hours, and did not terminate until past two o'clock on Sunday morning.— Soon after night-fall, such was the impatience manifested by the crowd for the issue of the trial, that it was with the greatest difficulty that they were restrained from offering personal violence to the members of the Court; and insulting language was several times addressed to the Judge.

On Monday morning ihe prisoners were again brought up, and after a short hearing, were acquitted on the other two charges.

EXECUTION OF J. TOWLE THE LUDDITE

Towle was apprentice to his father, a frame-work-knitter ; and no particular circumstance marked his character, good or bad, until he arrived at manhood ; but since that period, his life has several times been in jeopardy. In the year 1814 he was accused of being one of the band of frame-breakers that destroyed some frames in Mr. Garton's house, in New Basford, the village in whch Towle then lived; and at the Lent Assizes following, lhe was ?? to the bar,l hi e Co, itt- Hall, in Nottingham, and tried for the offence; ?? after a loug coitsn ltation, th I Jury bronigiht itn it v'ec'iittt of not g Iiti. n July, 1816, he was, huoever, again committed to prison on the clhane for twiiti he liws hlow paitl the penalty of the nitw.

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 02 February 1839

Death of an alleged Luddite.

On Friday, Mr. Thos. Glover, lacemaker, died at Nottingham, aged 54. His death was very sudden ; he fell down in a fit, when at work, and an inquest was held upon his body. The deceased was well known, in consequence of being tried, along with John Chettle, before Baron Graham, in the county hall at Nottingham, on Saturday the 3rd of August, 1816, charged with breaking the lace machines of Mr. Mullen and Mr. Wright, at New Radford. That memorable trial commenced on Saturday afternoon, and did not terminate until after two o'clock on Sunday morning. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Reader were counsel for the prosecution ; the present Lord Chief Justice, then Mr. Denman, was the sole counsel for the prisoners, and added to his well-earned reputation by the ability with which he conducted and established the *alibi* set up, unquestionably the moat complete of any it waa ever our lot to witness in a court of justice. Fortunately for the public peace, the reault of the trial was the acquittal of both prisoners. Had it been otherwise, the most fearful consequences would doubtless have ensued, for the body of the hall was for hours in possession of a number of men, who would not suffer a light to appear in court, excepting on the bench and the counsel table. It is notorious that armed men were in the outer hall, and the constables and javelin-men were quite unable to maintain order. Never shall we forget the shout with which the verdict of Not Guilty was received, and the unavailing attempts of the Judge to silence it. Since that period, Glover has sustained many vicissitudes of fortune, but latterly he has been much reduced in consequence of the great depreciation in the value of lace machinery. John Chettle, his fellow prisoner, died on the 15th of July last.— *Nottingham Review*.
