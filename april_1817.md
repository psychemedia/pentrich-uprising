NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 21. ATTEMPT AT MURDER.—Tuesday *Daniel Diggle* was tried for shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling-house; in the parish of Radford, near Nottingham, on the evening of the Sunday before Christrnas-day last, with a pistol, loaded with leaden shot, with intent to kill and murder him. There were two others, also indicted with him, of the names of *Henfrey* and *Wooley*, who have absconded, but, when found, will be tried on the same indictment.

The circumstances disclosed a scene of the most wicked and premeditated intent, not only to murder Kerry, but to break the frames in his house, by this small part of the gangs of *Luddites*, who have infested and disgraced this part of the county for some time past with impunity.

It appeared. that Henfrey and Wooley-brought two loaded pistols to Diggle's house, in Basford, on the evehing before named, and Shaw, in the presence of Diggle and his wife, went and got gunpowder from a man of the name of Pogson, and there loaded two other pistols. Henfrey, Diggle, and one Burton, then went to Kerry's, broke open the door of his house, where he and his family were sitting in peace, and Henfrey and Diggle went in and presented their pistols, demanding that the wife and family of Kerry should retire into the parlour. Kerry got up and seized Henfrey's pistol, which Henfrey endeavoured to discharge at the body of Kerry, but which Kerry turned aside, and the contents went into the fire in the room. Diggle then discharged his pistol at the head of Kerry, several of the shot corns from which entered his head, and were afterwards extracted by a surgeon. Kerry dropped down, exclaiming he was shot, and was a dead man. Henfrey and Diggle directly decamped, Diggle saying as he went out, "I have shot him dead, he fell as dead as a knit." Henfrey, Diggle, and Wooley wanted to turn back with Burton (who had a hammer with him for the purpose) to break the stocking frames in Kerry's house; but this they abandoned for the time. All these facts, with others, shewing the wickedness and depravity of the four *Luddites*, were disclosed upon the trial.

Diggle was convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, not only of Kerry and his family, but of Burton (one of the four), who was admitted evidence for the Crown.

The Judge (Mr. Baron RICHARDS) then passed sentence of Death upon Diggle in an impressive manner. Diggle, with three others, good indicted for besetting the house of Mr William Cook, at Short-Wood, near Trowell (gamekeeper to the Right Hon. Lord Middleton) in the night between the 2d and 3d of January last, and in company with five other persons, who have fled from justice amongst whom are the same Henfrey, Wooley, and Shaw, who conspired to take away the life of Kerry); and firing at Cook through his chamber window several times, and also firing at one Francis Thorley (a neighbour of Cook's, who came to his assistance), with pistols loaded with shot. In this prosecution Lord Middleton addressed the Learned Judge in a very feeling and impressive manner, stating, that as a dreadful example to the country was about to be made in the execution of Daniel Diggle, who was the principal person concerned in the outrage upon the person, family, and dwelling of one of his game-keepers, his Lordship did not wish for any sanguinary or vindictive proceedings against the three others in custody, and the more especially, as he had reason to believe they were the least guilty of any in the gang; for as to one of them, when Daniel Diggle proposed to break into Cook's house and murder him, that one prevented Daniel Diggle from so doing ; and therefore, with the Learned Judge's permission, he (Lord Middleton) would withdraw all further proceedings against them, his Lorship declaring, that all proper means should. be taken to apprehend Hentrey, Wooley, Shaw, and the others, who, it appeared, had been concerned in the attack upon the life of Kerry, but who were equally guilty with Daniel Diggle; in,the outrage of the middle of the night at Cook's. His Lordship declared that his motive was only public justice, and he thought, as to the four in custody, that end had been obtained.

The Learned Judge very pointedly complimented Lord Middleton upon the propriety of his conduct on the occasion, and in the most solemn and impressive manner addressed the three prisoners at the Bar, informing them, *that they owed their lives to his Lordship's interference in their favour*. The Learned Judge exhorted them to go home and break off from the gang of depredators with which they had been heretofore connected— to amend their lives. The desperate and depraved gangs of Luddites had too long been a disgrace to this county, and they must and should be put down.

EXECUTION OF D. DIGGLE.

On Wednesday morning, the 2d instant, Daniel Diggle suffered the awful sentence of the law, on a temporary gallows, erected in the front of the county gaol, at Nottingham, conformably to his sentence at the last assizes.This unfortunate man was a native of basford, near Nottingham, and was convicted of shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling  house, in the parish of Radford, (in company with other persons, who are still at large), on the evening of Sunday the 22d December last, with the intent to kill and murder him. From the time the decision of the Judge was made known to him, his only anxiety appeared to be how he might best prepare himself for another world. He fully admitted his guilt ; and his sorrow and contrition, not only on account of the crime for which he suffered, but the numerous other errors of his past life, was apparently deep and sincere. He conducted himself to the last moment with becoming resignation, and we trust, by the attentions paid to him by the Reverend Chaplain, and another worthy divine, who had daily visited him, he left the world supported by a rational hope of mercy, through all the sufficient merits of a crucified Redeemer. About 8 o'clock the culprit was brought forth through the County Hall door, in a light cart, along the platform raised on the steps, under the fatal tree. He appeared firm and collected, and addressing himself to the numerous spectators, said, it was " Ludding" that brought him to that untimely end:— he expressed his regret that he neglected the good advice given him by his parents, and that he had not abandoned his wicked courses in time to avert the dreadful fate that awaited him, and exhorted all present to take warning by his untimely end. After a few minutes spent in prayer, the cart was drawn off, and he was launched into eternity.— His last words were, " Lord have mercy upon my soul !" After hangingthe usual time, his body was cut down, and delivered to his friends for interment. He was a stout good looking man, but extremely illiterate. had just attained his 21st year, and had not long been married.

The particulars of the trial of Diggle have already been published; but since it may be gratifying to some persons to possess some short notice of his Prison Thoughts, a friend who visited him during the last week of his life, has furnished us with the following particulars:—

On my first interview with the prisoner, he appeared rather unconcerned, but a degree of natural reserve seemed to account in some measure for the circumstance. In all my subsequent visits he conversed frankly on the events of his past life; and manifested a degree of contrition (especially in his devotions), winch was very becoming his awful situation.— Whenever he adverted to his contempt of the advice of his parents, he was very deeply affected.

When he mentioned Luddism, which was frequently the case, he severely reprobated a system, in which he had latterly been an active, though a subordinate agent ; and he remarked with a feeling severity, upon the guilt and cruelty of the secret promoters of that practice, whom he declared that he considered equally criminal with himself.

On the Monday before he suffered, he had formed the resolution of speaking freely on the subject of Luddism and his other crimes, from the scaffold;  but fearing that his feelings might possibly prevent him, he desired that his sentiments might be written down, and published after his execution.

The following is the confession he earnestly desired might be published:—
  
" I, Daniel Diggle, being about to suffer death, and fearing that I may not be able to unburthen my mind at the place of execution, hare requested a friend to write down the following remarks and confession, to be made public after my decease.

" I freely acknowledge my guilt with respect to the particular crime for which I am to suffer; yet I declare, that when I entered Kerry's house, I had no intention of taking away his life, and that I never thought of injuring him, until he seized Wooley.

" I also acknowledge that I was guilty of the attack upon Lord Middleton's gamekeeper, and that I have been engaged in most of the frame breakings which have taken place in this neigbbourhood during the last 8 months ; but I never was in *Luddism* previous to that time ; I do not, however, publicly mention the names of my associates, as it is *my most anxious hope* that they will take warning from my unhappy fate, and escape the miseries and disgrace which I now experience.

" I would exhort with the earnestness of a *dying man*, not only my immediate companions, but *all who have been engaged in Luddism*, to break off from practices, which can only involve themselves and others in trouble and ruin. When they observe a young man, just 21 years of age, and who has only been married about as many weeks, brought to the scaffold by those very practices — when they see the anguish of my afflicted wife and parents— when they pass by the church yard of Basford, and observe the graves of Bamford, Towle, and myself, — and when they consider the perilous state of these now confined in Leicester gaol,— surely they will forsake their wicked course, and all who may have furnished money or liquor, as an incentive to crime, will be induced to repent of their cruelty. We have been often told that Luddism would benefit trade, but *I most earnestly beseech all my acquaintance*, as the last request I shall ever make of them, to consider it, as leading insensibly to the commission of the worst of crimes even murder itself.

" Almost the only comfort that I now experience is, that the life of an innocent man was not sacrificed; and as I consider Kerry, and those who gave evidence against me, as instruments in the hand of Almighty God, in bringing me to justice, it would greatly increase my present sufferings, could I suppose that any should bear them ill will or malice on my account.

" I feel very grateful to Lord Middleton for his tenderness towards my brother ; and I confidently hope from the change of mind which took place in Nathan whilst he was in prison, that mercy will not be lost upon him, and that there will be no occasion to bring him a second time before a bar of justice.

"If any who have visited me prison, have thought from my silence and reserve, that I did not feel my situation sufficiently, I can assure them that I now weep bitterly for my crimes, and fervently implore forgiveness at the tribunal of Him, who once pardoned a dying criminal, and who will not, I hope, condemn me although so guilty a sinner, "to the bitter pains of eternal death."

"DANIEL DIGGLE."

TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES. LEICESTER, APRIL 2.

After a protracted trial of two days (on Monday ten hours, and Tuesday fourteen), eight of the *Luddites* have been condemned to death— in the whole, there were twelve committed. *Blackburn* and *Burton* were admitted evidences. *Caldwell*, taken in fits during the trial, remains for next Assize. *Slater*, tried last Assize, under the Black Act (that is, for shooting), was again put to trial for frame breaking, to which charge he pleaded guilty, and is to be transported for life. The names of those condemned are *Savage*, *Withers*, *Towle*, *Amos*, *Crowder*, *Mitchell*, *Clark*, and *Watson*. Much important evidence was given on the trial. Fifteen others, for various offences, have been condemned. One was seized with convulsion fits during his trial, and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence, was remanded to prison. The town has been very peaceable during the Assize.

At seven o'clock on Monday morning a large assemblage of the principal inhabitants met at the Exchange, and being sworn in Special Constables, proceeded i i nmecliately afterwards to the judge’s lodgings, headed Mr. Mayor, with the Magistrates of the ISorough, and cscorted his Lordship to the Castle, when the following Prisoners were put to the bar and severally arraigned : 'Thotuns Savage, aged 39, William il/irrs, aged ,‘>3, William Tov.'lr, aged 22, ,/u/iu Amos, aged .lohii C/oJithcr, aged 40, Joshua Mifch. 11, aged 20, Samuel Cnh/ii'ell, aged 29, James IVatsem, aged 2!, John Clarke, aged A Jury was then attempted enipanneled, but the objections of the prisoners through the medium of their Counsel; were so numerous, th.u it could net be effected. All ti»e were then order from the bar except John Clarke, a!ij> httle Sam, who was put upon his trial, and a Jury sworn in. Mr. Serjeant Vaughan opened the business in a very animated and eloquent address to the Court, in which he paid high compliment to the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Mundy, who, Magistrate, had been principally instrumental in bringing the offenders to justice. Tl ;c first witness called, was Mr. John linden, par'nrr in the firm of Heathcote and Bodcn. .Mr. I>. had left the Factory eleven o’clock on the night which the depredation was committed ; an extra guard had been added few nights before the outrage the Foreman, in consequence of his apprehensions. When Mr. B. left, there were six. regular guards besides the watchman ; within the Factory were frames finished and unfinished, fifty-three were at work, twenty-three on the first floor, and thirty in the top story, —on that night, ten or yen men were employed, four or five on the first fioor, and five or six on the second. After the outrage had been committed Mr. B. sent otf immediately to the Bolice at Nottingham ; when lie returned the factory about five o'clock in the morning, found all the frames destroyed, the lace had been cut and burnt upon different parts the floor, most of the windows broken, apparently by stones from the outside, and Asher, one the guard that night, found had been shot in the head. A model of the factory was Court. The second witness, John Asher; about quarter past I'2, heard a noise of footsteps coming up the yard, facing the casting shop, heard the dog bark and a pistol off, when the dog ceased barking ; immediately after saw three men in the shop, with something over their faces as soon as they came to the door-way, 1 pointed a pistol at them ; they had either two or three pistols; my piaiol not being cocked did not off; turning herd one side, some person came in and fired pistol at me ; 1 was shot at the back of head ; was stunn'd ; when I came to myself, found was under the work bench, and was bleeding very fast, two men stood over us upon guard, Webster and Ironmonger were lying by me, heard a great knocking as if they wi breaking the machines. They were swearing and saying Ned your duty.” The men with the pistols kept guard over all the time, and said if I stirr’d they would blow my brains out; 1 was bleeding very fast; asked them if they would let me out or fetch a Doctor. was afraid I should bleed death ; they made no answer. ten minutes, they said the guardsmen, how is that man who is wounded ? the man said me, how are you ? said 1 was very bad—he asked if I could a bit longer ; I said I could if they would make haste—he said they would not be long—they went in about five minutes, i leaving bleeding; I was taken home, but before then, one the men who had come in, said, shake hands with the wounded man, but Webster put out his hand, and he shook hands with Webster. The third witness was, Mr. Palmer, surgeon, of Loughborough, who was called into Asher, and deposed to the state he found him in, having extracted a ball slug from his head, &c. &c. The fourth witness examined was John Blackburn, (one of the Luddites, who was admitted King's evidence.) John Blackburn, examined by Mr. Sergeant Vaughan lived Lambley in June last, about six miles trom dotting! ; knew John Clerk three weeks before that time ; the lir.t time acquainted with him was Radford, went by the name liUlc Sam, saw him at Lambley with -Withers before the Loughborough job above a week: I sent for little'Sam, talked about the Loughborough job ; little Sant and William Withers were present : told him that Savage had said they wanted him and two more for job ; asked where it was ; I told him at Loughborough; Withers joined the discourse; sail) Savage had 18/. down to buy tools and pistols with to do Heathcote’s factory, at Loughborough.

FURTHER TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES

LEICESTER ASSIZES

Tuesday, April 1.

Trial of Thomas Savage, Joshua Mitchell, Wm. Withers, William Towle, John Amos, John Crowder and James Watson, for firing a gun at John Asher.

On Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, the above prisoners were put to the bar, along with *Samuel Caldwell*, otherwise, *Big Sam*, and the Jury were called and sworn, without any difficulty, consisting of the following Genlemen:—

Humphrey Cartwright  
William Percival  
John Eames  
William Flint  
Thomas Simms  
Samuel Charles Hardy  
William Southernwood  
Willian Cooper  
Alphreus King  
Thomas Penford  
John Earpe

Sergeant Vaughan addressed the Court at great length, and then called Mr. John Pidden(?), who gave evidence to the same purport as the day before.

In midst of his examination the Court was thrown into some confusion, by Samuel Caldwell, one of the prisoners at the bar, falling down, in strong convulsions. He was carried out, and bled, and in about an hour, during which time the proceedings were staid, was again placed at the bar in a chair. In about two minutes he appeared as though he was asleep, with his head inclined against Crowser, who sat next to him. Some cordials were admonistered to him, and the opinion of Mr. Palmer and Dr. Freer taken, as to whether he was able to take his trial, and make his defence. The latter Gentleman was sworn, and stated, that the prisoner, Caldwell, had been in a state of convulsion, arising from agitatatn of mind, which had attended to a state of insensibility. It was probable that at intervals he might be able to attend to what was going forward, but the convulsions were likley to return, and be followed by a state of syncophy. It was possible that he might not be able to take his trial any better at a future day, for the same circumstances might produce the same effects.

John Blackburn was examined by Mr. Serjeant Vaughan as on the day before, and deposed much to the same purport.

William Burton also evidence for the Crown [*sic*], deposed, that in June last he worked at Arnold. On Sunday the 23d of that month, he went to see his parents at Old Rasford, where he saw William Towle, who asked him if he had any notion of making one in a bit of a job. Witness asked him what sort of job it was, he told him it was the same as that done at Radford. Witness asked where it was to be, but Towle would not tell him; he asked him when it was to take place, aud Towle said on Friday following, about thirteen or fourteen miles from Nottingham. Witness said he had not money enough to take him so far and back again, but Towle told him there would be £5 a man and all expenses paid. Witness said he had never been in any thing of the sort, he did not care if he did go. Towle asked him where might get another, he said he might take some of them that were at Radford with him, Diggle, or Barker, or Henfrey. He said he did not like to take Diggle or Henfrey, because they drank the money for the Radford job in the middle of the week, and that led to suspicion; and as to the other he was an apprentice, and his master and him might fall out if he were away so long. Just then witness saw Watson coming up, said, there's Watson yonder, he has been a soldier, and perhaps he'll stand. When Watson came up to them, Towle asked him if he had any objection to make one in a bit of a job. Watson said no, and asked what it was, at the same time offering to find another man if he wanted him. Towle said he did not want another; it was not in going a poaching, nor nothing of that kind. Witness told him no, it was a very serious job, and not to be laughed at— Towle added it was using a bit of hammer.— Watson agreed to go and they parted, but they were to meet again on the Thursday night following. Witness got to Basford about dark hour on Thursday evening, and saw William Towle, and they appointed to meet the next morning in Damms's meadow, between five and six o'clock. He went there accordingly, and saw Watson and Towle, when the latter informed them both that job was to be done at Loughborough. The three went down the Larkdale and met a man whom witness did not know, but he seemed to know Towle, and gave him four pistols. Witness does not know that he has ever seen the man since.

Liverpool Mercury - Friday 25 April 1817

EXECUTION OF LUDDITES, &c.

Leicester, April 17.— The most melancholy spectacle ever witnessed at Leicester took place this day, in the execution of the seven men under sentence of death, viz, the six Luddites, for destroying lace machines, and firing with intent to kill, in the factory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, at Loughborough, last June; the other for arson, or setting stacks on fire, at Newbold, in the said county. The names of the Luddites were— Joshua Mitchell, John Crowder, John Amos, William Towle, William Withers and Thomas Savidge; the name of the other Thomas Beavington. As early as six to o'clock in the morning they were removed, under military escort; from the jail to the new Bridewell, to be executed on the new drop. On their way, the Ludditea very cheerfully sung hymns all the time they passed. Beavington seemed very dejected.— Many thousands of spectators kept assembling until noon to witness this truly tragic scene, and conducted themselves in the most peaceable manner. About twelve o'clock the unhappy men appeared on the platform, attended by the Rev. Mr. Hayton, chaplain to the to the jail; the Rev. Mr. Vaughan, the Sheriff, and other officers. Since their condemnation the Luddites had conducted themselves in the most becoming manner, desiring forgiveness of God, and forgiving Blackburn and Burton, (by far the worse characters) who were admitted evidence against them. Beavington,an ignorant man, was insensible of his situation to the last. Savidge thanked the Reverend Ministers for their kindness and attention on their behalf; he said he had intended to say more, but the time was too far gone, hoped the people would take warning by their fate, fear no man, but fear God; and declared their innocence of shooting.— Amos addressed the people:—" Friends and fellow countrymen! You see here six men going to suffer innocently ; the man who committed the crime will soon be at large. Take warning by our fate— Farewell." Mitchell said a few words, much similar ; and without any apparent agitation they spoke to several friends in the crowd; and threw oranges, &c. to some of them, and desired to be remembered to their Nottingham acquaintances.— When all things were ready for the fatal moment, Amos, with a firm and undaunted voice, said they would now sing a hymn, and desired the people to join them, which was readily complied with by numbers. The hymn he chose, and to which he pitched the tune, was from Dr. Watts.

All the Luddites joined very earnestly in singing the hymn; immediately after which the platform  fell, and launched them into eternity.

Beavington declared his innocence to the last, and *called God to witness* he did not set the stacks on fire.

We lament to say, that the most of these misguided men, in the bloom of life, have left *widaos*, and more than *thirty children*, to add to the miseries of the present truly calamitous times !!

'That if any future dit lurbances arose in the county no motive should prevent him from using bis utmost endeavours to bring the authors to justice. That he had not spared any pains to learn the real cause of the apparently determined hostility that existed between the employer and the workmen—he had dived into gaol* for this purpose. ‘‘You may,” said his Lordship. think 1 possess hard heart, bull assure you not.” said he had been lo Leicester, and there he bad interviesr with one of the unfortunate men who were about to expiate their crimes an ignominious death. Yes, he had there seen one the unfortunate engines, in the bands of other men, and be believed he had ascertained the cause of the unnatural rancour that had so long existed. He had asked this unfortunate man if it was not possible for something done to put end to the system which had long existed in this county ; he would name this unhappy man, it was Savage, and this was thireply he made t—•' My Lord," said he. •• if the employer would but bxa price upon the work, that the workman might know what he had receive, building would have long ago; hut the workman never knew what price he have. ** My Lord,” continued this unfortunate man.

His Lordship concluded his speech, which appeared excite considerable interest in the mind* of the hearers, by a few other observations relative lo the baneful practices that have lon® existed in the county, but which, he thought, had now received a death blow.
