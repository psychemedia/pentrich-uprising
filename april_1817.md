Leeds Mercury - Saturday 01 February 1817

ATTACK ON THE PRINCE REGENT. An immense body of people had assembled in St. James's Park, at Whitehall, and in Parliament street, to see the procession of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent to and from the House. The multitude was vociferous-and the most outrageous epithets were applied to his Royal Highness as he passed along in the State Carriage, guarded on both sides by a strong escort of guards and constables. On the return of his Royal Highness from the Lords' Chamber of Parliament the crowding, clamour, and insults, increased. At the same time that cries of " God save the King," and huzzas were mixed with the vociferations personally offensive to the Prince Regent. After the cavalcade had entered the park, at the Horse Guards - and that it had proceeded about half way down the Mall, one of the windows of the state carriage in whch his Royal-Highness was placed, along with Lord James Murray, was shattered in two places by stones or some missiles from a hand unseen. It was nearly opposite the parl wall of Carlton-house. From the small puncture of the points from which the cracks in the pane radiated, it was at first thought to have happened by the accidental contact of an officer's sword, riding alongside, and who might have been pressed by the crowd against the Carriage, or that fragments of gravel had been thrown up against the glass by the horses' hoofs, or by some ruffian intentionally — but these ideas were discountenanced: an alarm was therefore excited that it might have proceeded from an air gun. No bullets nor stones were found in the carriage, the opposite window was not broken, nor was any person taken into custody; and his Royal Highness was safely set down at St. James's Palace, from which he had set out.

The Prince Regent, on alighting froms the state carriage at St. James's, informed Sir Nathaniel Conant, who was in attendance, of the cicumstance, and inmediately afterwards the Duke of Montrose went off with all possible speed for Viscount Sidmouth, for his assistance and those under him, to endeavour to discover the offenders. His Grace proceeded to the Secretary of State's Office. when Lord Sidmouth not beingi there, Mr. Hiley Addington sent a messenger to his brother at the House of Peers, to inform hisiii of what had happened, and to command his attendance at St. James's Palace. The Prince Regent, after waiting a considerable time for the arrival of Lord Sidmouth at St. James's Palace, left it in his private carriage for Carlton House, leaving his commands for Lord Sidmouth to follow him. His Lordship arrived shortly afterwards, as did the Duke of York, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.

A drawing of the pane of glass, destribing two- small punctures from which cracks radiated, was made by his Royal Highness himself after he arrived at St. James's, but after this, we understand the pane was broken or fell into pieces, and that by a second stroke. Whatever substance it was by which the glass was broken, it did not enter the carriage, as it was carefully searched for the purpose.

As a proof to what extent the terror excited by this traitorous assault was carried in the minds of Ministers, the Guards at the Palaces, the Park. the Bank, and every where, were doubled. A message was sent to the Lord Mayor, informing him of the outrage, and instructing him, if he found it necessary towards the maintenance of the public peace, to call in the miltary power, to address hinmself to the Commanding Officer at the Tower for that purpose ; and dispatches were sent by the mail coaches to every part of the kingdons, to put the Mlagistrates in every place on their guard.

We are happy to state, however, that by five o'clock in the afternoon the streets were perfectly clear of the mob, and no disposition to riot appeared in any part of the town. *Morning Chronicle*

ATTACK ON THE PRINCE REGENT.

On Saturday, *Thomas Scott*, the person in custody, who stands charged with being a party to the outrage committed upon the Prince Regent, on Tuesday week, underwent another examination at Bow-Street. The office was crowded. Mr. Adolphus attended as Counsel for the prisoner.

The first witness called, was Lord James Murray, who again minutely detailed all that came under his observation on that occasion. His Lordship stated, in the course of his evidence, that he observed ten or twelve persons singularly conspicuous in their violence, and whom he could identify. When the carriage reached about the centre of the Mall, one of the windows, on the left side, was perforated by something striking against it. The noise was so great from the blow as almost to stun him. On looking to the glass, be observed two small round holes very near to each other; the glass was starred, but not further broken; the small splinters of the glass flew downwards, towards the opposite side of the carriage. His Lordship had not the least doubt those holes were produced by bullets, such as he tad seen discharged from stick-guns, which are not quite so large as an air-gun, and from the direction they took they must have come from above. The glass was extremely thick, and even the large stones which afterwards broke the glass did not enter the carriage. The perforations on the glass were very small, not larger than a pea, and quite round. He was quite satisfied the holes were made by a metallic body, from the appearance they assumned. There were other fractures by stones, one of which demolished the holes he had been describing. By the Prince Regent's desire his Lordship put his hat against the window, to prevent any stones from coming in, and fortunately it was he did so for many stones were thrown, and hit the glass afterwards, seven or eight in number. His lordship had since been in the Park, and on looking among the trees, he observed in several of them a considerable quantity of stones remaining, as if they had been put there purposely. His Royal Highness sat with his face to the horses ; the Duke of Montrose and witness sat opposite his Royal Highness, with their backs to the horses.

James Neverhouse, of Newington Causeway, was in the Park on Tuesday ; saw the prisoner pressing forward of himself, as if he wished to be foremost of the mob; saw a stone thrown from where the prisoner stood, but cannot say he threw it; the stone went in a slanting direction, and certainly hit the carriage.

A person of the name of Chaunter, now came forward to offer evidence to rebut that given against the prisoner; but his testimony was rejected, on the ground that he could be examined alone on the trial of the prisoner, should it be deemed proper to commit him. Mr. Hicks recognized this witness too, as having been before him upon a charge of misconduct, within the last three months, at Marlboough-Street.

The prisoner, in the course of his examination, repeatedly declared his innocence, and his willingness to stand the test of every inquiry.

Information, it is said, has been received by Mr. Hicks, tending in a great measure to confirm the belief that it was intended to attempt the Regent's life, but this, in no respects, affects or applies to the prisoner.

SECOND EDITION.

At half-past twelve o’clock this morning the examination of *Thomas Scott*, charged with being one of the persons who comitttd the atrocious outrages against the of person of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent Tuesday last, was resumed before Mr. Hicks and Mr Gifford, the Magistrates.

Lord James Murray stated, that on Tuesday last he accompanied his Royal Highness the Prince Regent to the House of Lords. On the approach of the Royal carriage into the Park, from St. James's'Palace, the mob commenced hooting, hissing, &c. &c. A number of persons surrounded the carriage, and continued near it until the arrival of the procession to the Horse Guards, when they dispersed thro' the avenues towards George-street; and in Parliament-street they met the carriage again, when they re-commenced hissing, hooting, &c. until its arrival at the House of Lords. On the return of his Royal Highness through the Horse Guards, the mob again assembled from George-street, and repeated the hooting, groans, &c.: they came up to the carriage on the near side; they were the same faces his Lordship saw about the carriage as the procession was proceeding to the House : they did not keep close to the carriage. The mob continued to surround the carriage until it arrived between Marlborough House and the Stable Yard, when the near window was perforated by something which his Lordship conceived to be bullets, about the same size of a pea; immediately after that, a large stone was thrown against the glass window, and it smashed it,—some of the particles of glass fell into his Lordship's eyes, and his Royal Highness directed him put his hat against the window ; the mob continued to throw stores at the carriage until it got to the Stable-yard; his Lordship could not identify the person of the prisoner.

Mr. James Moorhouse, of No. 39, Newington Causeway, stated, that on Tuesday last he accompanied a friend to the Park, to see the procession. On the approach of the Royal carriage to the elevation near Carlton-house, the mob, which was immense, began to vociferate hisses, groans, &c. &c. Witness continued near the same spot until the procession returned from the Lords, and then preceded it towards the Stable-yard. On the arrival of the Royal carriage opposite Marlborough-house, a crowd of persons gathered round it on the near side ; witness was rather before the carriage, and he saw the prisoner’s face once or twice ; he appeared to be pressing forward towards the carriage, and was very active in the mob; he did not appear as if he was pushed by them. Witness saw a stone thrown against the carriage, but he, could not say that the prisoner threw it; it came from place where the prisoner was standing. He saw an arm up after the stone was thrown, but could not say that the arm was tbe prisoner's. He was sure of the prisoner's person, as he had often seen him about town.

Mr. Hicks observed, at the close of the evidence, that it wore the aspect of three distinct species of treason. It was certain that the offence of high treason was committed on that day, and the question was, by whom was it committed ? His (Mr. H.'s) mind was made up, that there was full and sufficient evidence already heard against the prisoner to warrant him to commit him for trial.

He was then remanded for re-examinatlon on Wednesday next, at one o'clock.

ATTACK ON THE REGENT.

The Public may wish to know how the Country papers speak of this treasonable attempt. We made extracts from those received yesterday—We continu them to day:—

"Such has been the remit of the machinations of those incendiaries, whose only objects are riot, robbery and revolution. We hope and trust that means will be taken to prevent the further anti-constitutional endeavors of the vile Cabal." *Chester Chronicle.*

The following is from *Drakards Stamford News* of yesterday— Attempts at assassination are considered as subjects for levity !!

"Our readers we know to be particularly anxious for the fate of —— ———— of St. James's; but as yet we cannot inform them whether his Royal Highness was shot from the trees or the stars; and, if shot at *at all* whether the Lord of the Bedchamber swallowed the bullets. It is said that the plot of Spa-fields, having failed in effect, it has been thought expedient by the Ministers prepare new one ;--but this is not credible."

SECOND EXAMINATION OF THOMAS SCOTT, ON SUSPICION OF HIGH TREASON.

BOW-STREET, SATLURDAY— Lord James Murray was the first witness called. He stated, that on Tuesday last he accompanied his Royal Highness the Prince-Regent from St James's Palace to the House of Lords. On coming into the Park, from the Stable-yard, he discovered that's great concourse of spectators had assembled, and they proceeded to surround the carriage, hooting, hissing, &c. The mob was with, and near, the carriage, until it arrived at the Horse Guards ;-some of them then separated, and went towards George-street. They met and assailed the carriage in Whitehall; and near the House of Lords his Lordship saw a great many of the same counterances he had seen in the Park around the carriage. On the return of his Royal Highness, after having passed through the Horse Guards, the mob followed the carriage in the same manner they had done before. When the carriage arrived nearly opposite the end of Marlhorough House, the near window was perforated in two places, in roundish holes; there was about the breadth of two fingers between them, and in the intermediate space there was a crack running from one hole to the other.

Mr. Hicks— Did your Lordship hear any thing before you saw the holes ?— I heard the glass struck very sharply, and I then saw it was broken. I saw the glass as quick as lightning driven in a slanting position to the other side of the carriage. It struck the glass so sharply as almost to deprive me of my hearing.

Mr. Hicks— Your Lordship sat with your back towards the horses, so that any other person in the carriage might not have heard it so forcibly ?—My right ear was very close to the glass.

Mr. Gifford—From all your Lordship saw and heard, what is the impression on your Lordship's mind with respect to what could have caused the perforations ?—I think, from what I heard, and from appearances, that they must have been caused by bullets, or by some composition; I am sure they could not have been made by stones, as both the holes were made at the same time.

Mr. Hicks—Whatever it might have been, according to the impression on your Lordship's mind it could not be stones?— No; as the holes were obliquely made, as if the cause of them had come from the trees. The holes were of that size which he had seen made by shot fired out of an air gun, made in the shape of a stick, about the size of a pea. When we got between Marlherough Gardens and the Stable-yard, a large stone was thrown against the window, and so much of the particles of glass got into my eyes that I could scarcely see.

Mr. Gifford—Can your Lordship say whether any stones were thrown after the glass had been perforated ?—I think some stones were thrown behind; about ten yards after the carriage had passed Marlborough-gardens, between them and the stable yard, a large stone was thrown which fractured the glass; it was thrown with so much violence as to pulverize the glass; some pieces stuck into his Lordship's forehead, and some of the larger pieces of glass fell in the carriage, and some into the road. Witness put up his hand to his eyes, and immediately afterwards seven or eight stones were thrown, which struck different parts of the carriage; there were no stones of the description of those so thrown in the road. His Lordship had since seen the carriage, and be found it to be deeply in indented. He was astonished to find that the stones recoiled fromn the glass. Between Marlborough House and the Stable-yard, there were a great many very large stones thrown; they flew thickest when the carriage was turning round into the Stable-yard; some of them were as big as his fist. By the advice of his Royal Highness I put up my hat to the broken glass. I have examined the state-carriage since, and have discovered several dents in the panel near the glass. There were four or five dents near the place where his Royal Highness sat. I went to the Park yesterday for the purpose of ascertaining the precise spot where the carriage was attacked, and I found a great many stones there. I looked into the trees, and was astonished to find that between Marlborough House and the Stable-yard, in every other tree there were a great many very large stones." In answer to some questions put by Mr. Adolphus, Counsel for the prisoner, his Lordship said the Prince sat in the centre of the carriage; there was no person on either side of him.

A person stepped forward who said his name was James Moorhouse, and he lived at No. 39, Newington-causeway. On Tuesday last he went to the Park to see the procession to the House: he stood on the top of the hill near Carlton-house; there was a great deal of hissing and hooting, which witness was very sorry to hear. Witness continued in the Park until the procession returned, and went towards the Stable yard; he got stationed in the crowd, just beyond Marlborough House, on the right side of the middle walk. Witness was rather before the carriage when he saw the prisoner once or twice. Witness was quite sure of his person as he had seen him before about town; he appeared to be pressing forward, and was very active in the mob. Witness saw him a second time near the Life-guardsman (Laycock). Wftness saw a stone thrown, but could not say the prisoner threw it; it came from the place where the prisoner was standing; he saw an arm raised up, but he could not say whether it was the prisoner's. Witness saw no more of the prisoner; he got near Lord Harrington s windows, and saw a boy about 15 or 16 years of age throwing stones at the carriage. Witness attempted to seize hitm, but could not, as the pressure of the crowd was so great The stones struck the royal carriage; he should know the boy again. Witness went to the house of Correction on Thursday, and immediately identified the prisoner.

Robert Turner was next called. The whole amount of his evidence was, that he saw a man throw a stone at the carriage, and it broke the window, but he was sure it was not the prisoner.

Mr. Hicks observed, that in cases, and particularly in a case of so much importance both to the public and the prisoner, he was most anxious that the accused should have the benefit of legal assistance; " but (observed the Worthy Magistrate) I will tell you, Mr. Adoiphus, that the charge likely to be instituted against the prisoner is of the highest nature; and before I fully commit him for trial, I shall cautiously look into the different Acts of Parliament. But I anm so distinctly clear upon all the points of law applicable to the present case, that I think the evidence bears out three different species of high treason against the unfortunate man at the bar; my mind is made up; we have evidence enough to shew that high treason has been committed on that day. Then the only question is, by whom was it committed? This remains for a Jury to decide." All the witnesses then signed and swore to their depositions, and the prisoner was ordered to be brought up again on Wednesday next, at one o'clock, in order to be finally examined. On an application made by Mr. Adolphus, Mr. Hicks gave diretions that the prisoner's legal advisers should be admitted to him in prison.

Morning Chronicle - Thursday 06 February 1817

PUBLIC OFFICE, BOW-STREET.— The further examination of the case of THOMAS SCOTT, charged as one of the persons implicated in the late disgraceful and atrocious outrage on the person of the Prince Regent, was resumed yesterday at this Office.

Lieutenant Martin, of the 2d Regiment of Guards, stated that Major Vyse commanded the squadron on duty. It was the duty of the Major to ride on one side of the royal carriage, and of a Subaltern on the other, with their horses heads as close as possible to the windows. From the shouting and pressure of the mob, the horses became frightened, and could not be kept in that situation. After passing Carlton House, on the return from the House of Lords, witness was on the near side. Townsend, the police officer told him the window had been fired at.—Witness saw a fracture in the glass, but in his opinion it was too small for a ball. The glass was starred. Several stones were afterwards thrown, some of which struck him on the back. It was usual on those occasions for the officers to have a corporal on the outside of them, just to cover them.

Corporal Howcroft was next called. He could not say that he should know the face of any person in the crowd. His officer. Lieut. Martin, kept as near the carriage as possible.

John Armstrong, one of the officers of Worship-street, said he was stationed in the Park, with five other officers, under the direction of Mr. Gifford, between Marlborough House and the Stable-yard. As the royal carriage proceeded to the House, there was groaning and hissing among the mob. Witness and the other officers kept their station until the return of the procession. The people then tried to break through them (the Officers). After the coach had passed, Mr. Gifford said, there was something wrong. They went towards the place, and saw Laycock, the Life Guardsman, on his horse, and Mr. Chambers and the Prisoner, Scott, without their hats. They took the latter into custody. The mob were very riotous. Witness told them that a Magistrate was present, and he would see justice done. He did not know at that time that any accident had happened to the carriage. He took the Prisoner to the guard-house.

John Webb, one of the Yeomen of the Guard, was stationed on the near side, close to the door of the carriage. On the return from the House of Lords, he observed the glass of the carriage cracked, about a hundred yards from the Horse Guards, near the great gun. When they had got about half way up the back of the Prince's garden, he observed that the glass was struck again—he told Townsend of the circumstance.— The second stone thrown at the carriage he picked up. Before they got to the Stable-yard, more than twenty stones were thrown, besides potatoes and apples, some of which struck witness. A very large stone broke the glass between Marlborough-house and the Stable-yard. He observed two or three persons in the crowd whom he should know. One of them was a taller man than the Prisoner ; he wore a shallow hat and brown coat. Witness did not see the Prisoner.

Mr. W. Dawes was in the Park as an observer. There was a great deal of indignant language as the carriage passed and returned. He saw the prisoner standing by the Life-guardsman, and the latter seizing him by the collar, The prisoner had previously lifted his umbrella, but in the opinion of witness, it was in self-defence, to prevent his being kicked by the horse. He was confirmed in this opinion, from the opportunity which the prisoner had to escape if he wished, while the Life-guardsman was turning his horse about.

Mr. Hicks, the Magistrate who presided on the Bench with Mr. Gifford, lamented that out of the number of persons present in the Park, not one had been taken into custody except the prisoner, where hundreds might have been seized, and no person had come forward except Mr. Chambers. The country must be for ever obliged to that Gentleman. Had there been less evidence than the present the prisoner would still be highly criminal, as he took no pains to quell the riot. Upon a review of the evidence, however, he felt it his duty to discharge him from the charge of treason, but he must commit him for a misdemeanour, in aiding and assisting in the riot. At the same time he would admit him to bail, in two sureties in 100l. each, and himself in 200l.; and as he had suffered a week imprisonment, he would not require the issual notice of 24 hours.

Mr. Price, the prisoner's Solicitor, said, he would procure the bail required imnmediately.

[TH: the bail was a large sum; who would cover the bail and why?]

Aris's Birmingham Gazette - Monday 30 December 1816

It is with the greatest concern we feel it our duty, this week, to record one of the most atrocious attempts at murder that has ever disgraced this county :—On Sunday evening last, about a quarter before eight o'clock, as George Kerry and his family (who reside at a lone house, by the road leading from Bobbers mill to Bilborotigh) were sitting by the fire, at supper, their house was entered by two men in disguise. Kerry, in attempting to seize the foremost man, was shot at by him, but without effect ; during the struggle the other man fired, but fortunately the slugs only grazed his head. The murderers thinking their object attained, instantly departed. The most prompt assistance was rendered by the neighbours, and the police from Nottingham; but owing to the frost and the extreme darkness of the night, no trace whatever could be discovered of their retreat. On further enquiry, we learn, that a third person was standing at the door during the transaction, and the prevailing opinion is, that the party were *Luddites*, and that they came from New Radford. *Nottingham Journal*

Nottingham Review - Friday 24 January 1817

We find that James Towle, on the morning previous to his execution, made a full and particular disclosure, to the High Sheriff of Leicestershire, and to a Justice of the Peace, for that county, of every person, directly or indirectly concerned in the felony and destruction, at Mr. Heathcoat's factory, at Loughborough, and of the Luddites in general, which has been kept secret, until it could be made subservient to the ends of justice ;—he died penitent ; assured the gentlemen that what he had stated to them was true, observing, it would be of no service to him then to say what was false, and lamented that he had not made this discovery sooner, to have saved his life :—his comrades are now doing so; the Luddites are impeaching one another, and the Magistrates are in possession, we are credibly informed, of their whole history. Of the 15 men now apprehended, ten are charged with the offence at Loughborough. It is hoped that the wicked and mischievous proceedings of the Luddites are now at an end : they have driven the best part of our manufactory from the town, and the destruction of property employed in trade, has injured the great bulk of manufacturers and the public in general. We hope and trust that the time will be revived, when the ingenuity and industry of our mechanics will again raise the trade of this empire above the rest of the world ; and we feel confident, that the skill of the workman, will be powerfully aided by the great capital this country can bring into trade, whenever it can be done with security, and the master and servant are free to make what contracts they may choose to enter into with each other. As none of the men have yet been examined before the magistrates, we decline entering into further particulars until next week.

...

On the 15th instant, Joseph Mellors, Nathan Diggle, and Daniel Diggle were committed to the county gaol, for trial at the next assizes, charged with shooting at William Cooke and Francis Thorley, at Trowell, in this County.

The three men, for whose apprehension a reward was offered; they being charged with assaulting the Earl of Chesterfield's gamekeepers, have been taken up, and were lodged in our county gaol on Wednesday night; but they have not yet been examinied before the magistrates.

NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 21.

Attempt at Murder.— Tuesday *Daniel Diggle* was tried for shooting at George Kerry, in his dwellingghouse, in the parish of Radford, near Nottingham, on the evening of the Sunday before Christmas Day last, with a pistol, loaded with leaden shot, with intent to kill and murder him. There were two other also indicted with him, of the names of *Henfrey* and *Wooley*, who have absconded, but, when found, will be tried on the same indictment.

The circumstances disclosed a scene of the most wicked and premeditated intent, not only to murder Kerry, but to break the frames in his house, by this small part of the gangs of Luddites who have infested and disgraced this part of the county for some time past, with impunity.

It appeared that Henfrey and Wooley brought two loaded pistols to Diggle's house, in Basford, on the evening before named, and Shaw, in the presence of Diggle and his wife, went and got gunpowder from a man of he name Pogson, and there loaded two other pistols. Henfrey, Diggle, and one Burton, then went to Kerry's. broke open the door of his house, where he and his family were sitting in peace, and Henfrey and Diggle went in and presented their pistols, demanding that the wife and family of Kerry should retire into the parlour. Kerry got up and seized Henfrey's pistol, which Henfrey endeavoured to discharge at the body of Kerry, but which Kerry turned aside, and the contents went into the fire in the room. Diggle then discharged his pistol at the head of Kerry, several of the shot corns from which entered his head, and were afterwards extracted by a surgeon.— Kerry dropped down, exclaiming he was shot, and was a dead man. Henfrey and Diggie directly decamped, Diggle saying as he went out, "I have shot him dead, he fell as dead as a knit." Henfrey, Diggle, and Woodley wanted to turn back with Burton (who had a hammer with him for the purpose) to breaking the stocking frames in Kerry's house ; but this they abandoned for the time. All these facts, with others, shewing the wickedness and depravity of the four Luddites, were disclosed upon the trial.

Diggle was convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, not only of Kerry and his family, but of Burton (one the four) who was admitted evidence for the Crown.

The Judge ( Mr. Baron RICHARDS) then passed sentence of death upon Diggle, in an impressive manner.

Diggle, with three others, stood indicted for besetting the house of Mr. William Cook, at Shortwood, near Trowell, (gamekeeper to the Right Honourable Lord Middleton) in the night between the 2nd and 2d of January last, and in company with five other persons, who have fled from justice (amongst whom are the same Henfrey, Wooley, and Shaw, who conspired to take away the life of Kerry ), and firing at Cook through his chamber window; several times, and also firing at one Francis Thorley (a neighbour of Cook's, who came to his assistance ), with pistols loaded with shot, In this prosecution Lord Middleton addressed the Learned Judge in a very feeling apd impressive manner, stating, that as a dreadful example to the country was about to be made in the execution of Daniel Diggle, who was the principal person concerned in the outrage upon the person, family, and dwelling of one of his game-keepers, his Lordship did not wish for any sanguinary or vindictive proceedings against the three others in custody, and the more especially, as he had reason to believe they were the least guilty of any in the gang ; for as to one of them, when Daniel Diggle proposed to break into Cook's house and murder him, that one prevented Daniel Diggle from so doing ; and therefore, with the Learned Judge's permission, he (Lord Middleton) would withdraw all further proceedings against them, his Lordship declaring, that all proper means should taken to apprehend Henfrey, Wooley, Shaw, and the others, who, it appeared, had been concerned in the attack upon the of life Kerry, but who are equally guilty with Daniel Diggle, in the outrage in the middle of the night at Cook's. His Lordship declared that his motive was only public justice, and he thought, as to the four in custody, that end had been obtained.

The Learned Judge very pointedly complimented Lord Middleton upon the propriety of his conduct on the occasion, and in the most solemn and impressive manner addressed the three prisoners at the bar, informing them *that they owed their lives to his Lordship's interference in their favour*. The Learned Judge exhorted them to go home and break off from the gang of depredators with which they had been heretofore connected —to amend their lives. The desperate and depraved gangs of Luddites had too long been a disgrace to this county, and they must and should be put down.

NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 21. ATTEMPT AT MURDER.—Tuesday *Daniel Diggle* was tried for shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling-house; in the parish of Radford, near Nottingham, on the evening of the Sunday before Christmas-day last, with a pistol, loaded with leaden shot, with intent to kill and murder him. There were two others, also indicted with him, of the names of *Henfrey* and *Wooley*, who have absconded, but, when found, will be tried on the same indictment.

The circumstances disclosed a scene of the most wicked and premeditated intent, not only to murder Kerry, but to break the frames in his house, by this small part of the gangs of *Luddites*, who have infested and disgraced this part of the county for some time past with impunity.

Kerry dropped down, exclaiming he was shot, and was a dead man. Henfrey and Diggle directly decamped, Diggle saying as he went out, "I have shot him dead, he fell as dead as a knit." Henfrey, Diggle, and Wooley wanted to turn back with Burton (who had a hammer with him for the purpose) to break the stocking frames in Kerry's house; but this they abandoned for the time. All these facts, with others, shewing the wickedness and depravity of the four *Luddites*, were disclosed upon the trial.

Diggle was convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, not only of Kerry and his family, but of Burton (one of the four), who was admitted evidence for the Crown.

The Judge (Mr. Baron RICHARDS) then passed sentence of *Death* upon Diggle in an impressive manner.

Diggle, with three others, stood indicted for besetting the house of Mr William Cook, at Short-Wood, near Trowell (gamekeeper to the Right Hon. Lord Middleton) in the night between the 2d and 3d of January last, and in company with five other persons, who have fled from justice amongst whom are the same Henfrey, Wooley, and Shaw, who conspired to take away the life of Kerry); and firing at Cook through his chamber window several times, and also firing at one Francis Thorley (a neighbour of Cook's, who came to his assistance), with pistols loaded with shot. In this prosecution Lord Middleton addressed the Learned Judge in a very feeling and impressive manner, stating, that as a dreadful example to the country was about to be made in the execution of Daniel Diggle, who was the principal person concerned in the outrage upon the person, family, and dwelling of one of his game-keepers, his Lordship did not wish for any sanguinary or vindictive proceedings against the three others in custody, and the more especially, as he had reason to believe they were the least guilty of any in the gang; for as to one of them, when Daniel Diggle proposed to break into Cook's house and murder him, that one prevented Daniel Diggle from so doing ; and therefore, with the Learned Judge's permission, he (Lord Middleton) would withdraw all further proceedings against them, his Lorship declaring, that all proper means should. be taken to apprehend Hentrey, Wooley, Shaw, and the others, who, it appeared, had been concerned in the attack upon the life of Kerry, but who were equally guilty with Daniel Diggle; in,the outrage of the middle of the night at Cook's. His Lordship declared that his motive was only public justice, and he thought, as to the four in custody, that end had been obtained.

The Learned Judge very pointedly complimented Lord Middleton upon the propriety of his conduct on the occasion, and in the most solemn and impressive manner addressed the three prisoners at the Bar, informing them, *that they owed their lives to his Lordship's interference in their favour*. The Learned Judge exhorted them to go home and break off from the gang of depredators with which they had been heretofore connected— to amend their lives. The desperate and depraved gangs of Luddites had too long been a disgrace to this county, and they must and should be put down.

Nottingham Review - Friday 28 March 1817

ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE. COUNTY NOTTINGHAM [CONTINUED FROM OUR LAST] Tuesday, March 18, 1817.

This morning, DANIEL DIGGLE, a fine stout-looking young man, only 20 years of age, was put to the bar, and arraigned on a charge of having on the night of Sunday, the 22d of December last, entered the dwelling-house of George Kerry, situate in the parish of Radford, armed and disguised, and then and there, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully shot at the said Goerge Kerry, with intent to kill and murder him.

To this indictment the prisoner pleaded *guilty*, but Sir Richard Richards, having humanely pointed out to him the consequences of such a plea, and recommended him to reconsider the matter, and by pleading *not guilty*, taking the chance of a trial, with some reluctance he consented, and pleaded *not guilty*.

Serjant Vaughan shortly stated the case In the Jury. Four men were concerned in the perpetration of this atrocius act. One of them stood at the bar; another would he brought to give evidence, and the other two, Woolley and Henfrey had absconded.
  
Mr. Denman called William Burton the accomplice, but his Lorship wising to have Kerry's evidence first, he was called, and Burton was ordered out of Court.

George Kerry (*examined by Mr. Denman*) was a framework-knitter, and lived at Radford. On the Sunday before Christmas Day, about eight o'clock in the evening, himself, his wife, his mother, Hannah Morley, and his niece (Ann Kerry,) were at home. The door was closed and latched, but not locked.

 Two men knell up the I.orh, opened the door, sad came in; they had dull colonrsal long great coats on, with handkerchiefs over their fares, tied up to their eyes; Sine was dark checked handkerchief, the other a light faded one; their hats acre sloucl u •il down; one was a taller man, the other nut so tall ; at snub a time one cannot tell to one, two, or three inches; they •aid Advance into the parlour," but the women were so frightened, instead of obeying the order, they all stem into a corner of the room; we arm sitting in the house.place—the house place is on one tide of the dour, and the parlour on the other. The men had pistols in their hands, hick they presented at me and my family; I rose up from my chair, and seized the final man's pistol by the barrel; he was the shorter man of the two. • struggling sued; I. • appeared wishful to discharge the pistol into my body; I turned it aside, and when he pulled the trigger, the content, went into the fire, and knocked out some coals; the candle stood shout a yard and a half off, and it was blown out by the firing of the pistol I gave the pistol a twitch, but slid not get it from him, I only dire out the ramrod.—(The minim/ sear is Coarr.) I saw the other man a ith his pistol ready to discharge it at my head, he 'total within nine inches of me, and perceiving he ass g gto tire, I steamed 'loan, and when he tired, part of the contents catched my head, and the other part went into the wall in a triangular form; it aas loaded with shot and slugs, and hit a tea tray fixed against the wall, and knocked it down Two shot corns entered my head, 51 r Altenhurrow (surgeop) o extracted one that night, and another the Saturday following.

I saw Daniel Diggle afterwards in the gaol at Nottingham; it was on the 15th of Feb Hannah Morley and John Kerry were with me Hy order of lie Nollestone, one of the Magistrates, the turnkey's lodge was cleared, and Diggle was brought up me.

On being asked whether he had any witnesses to call, he mentioned several were called in ewer!, but none of them appeared. After a pause, the Learned Judge began his charge to the Jury; but before he had penceeded far, it was announced thaal near the prisoner's witnesses had made his appearance, and his Lordship, with that his. manity, which we hail frequent opportunities of admiring, while he in raided in the criminal court, and %%hies we cannot sufficiently applaud, immediately paused, and ordered the witness to be sworn.

These %toed were pronounced with so much solemnity, that they appeared to make a deep impression both on the prisoner and the Court : almost every eye was suffused with tears, and his Lordship himself was evidently much affected.

Leicester Journal - Friday 11 April 1817

EXECUTION OF D. DIGGLE.

On Wednesday morning, the 2d instant, Daniel Diggle suffered the awful sentence of the law, on a temporary gallows, erected in the front of the county gaol, at Nottingham, conformably to his sentence at the last assizes.This unfortunate man was a native of basford, near Nottingham, and was convicted of shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling  house, in the parish of Radford, (in company with other persons, who are still at large), on the evening of Sunday the 22d December last, with the intent to kill and murder him. From the time the decision of the Judge was made known to him, his only anxiety appeared to be how he might best prepare himself for another world. He fully admitted his guilt ; and his sorrow and contrition, not only on account of the crime for which he suffered, but the numerous other errors of his past life, was apparently deep and sincere. He conducted himself to the last moment with becoming resignation, and we trust, by the attentions paid to him by the Reverend Chaplain, and another worthy divine, who had daily visited him, he left the world supported by a rational hope of mercy, through all the sufficient merits of a crucified Redeemer. About 8 o'clock the culprit was brought forth through the County Hall door, in a light cart, along the platform raised on the steps, under the fatal tree. He appeared firm and collected, and addressing himself to the numerous spectators, said, it was " Ludding" that brought him to that untimely end:— he expressed his regret that he neglected the good advice given him by his parents, and that he had not abandoned his wicked courses in time to avert the dreadful fate that awaited him, and exhorted all present to take warning by his untimely end. After a few minutes spent in prayer, the cart was drawn off, and he was launched into eternity.— His last words were, " Lord have mercy upon my soul !" After hanging the usual time, his body was cut down, and delivered to his friends for interment. He was a stout good looking man, but extremely illiterate. had just attained his 21st year, and had not long been married.

The particulars of the trial of Diggle have already been published; but since it may be gratifying to some persons to possess some short notice of his Prison Thoughts, a friend who visited him during the last week of his life, has furnished us with the following particulars:—

On my first interview with the prisoner, he appeared rather unconcerned, but a degree of natural reserve seemed to account in some measure for the circumstance. In all my subsequent visits he conversed frankly on the events of his past life; and manifested a degree of contrition (especially in his devotions), winch was very becoming his awful situation.— Whenever he adverted to his contempt of the advice of his parents, he was very deeply affected.

When he mentioned Luddism, which was frequently the case, he severely reprobated a system, in which he had latterly been an active, though a subordinate agent ; and he remarked with a feeling severity, upon the guilt and cruelty of the secret promoters of that practice, whom he declared that he considered equally criminal with himself.

On the Monday before he suffered, he had formed the resolution of speaking freely on the subject of Luddism and his other crimes, from the scaffold;  but fearing that his feelings might possibly prevent him, he desired that his sentiments might be written down, and published after his execution.

The following is the confession he earnestly desired might be published:—
  
" I, Daniel Diggle, being about to suffer death, and fearing that I may not be able to unburthen my mind at the place of execution, hare requested a friend to write down the following remarks and confession, to be made public after my decease.

" I freely acknowledge my guilt with respect to the particular crime for which I am to suffer; yet I declare, that when I entered Kerry's house, I had no intention of taking away his life, and that I never thought of injuring him, until he seized Wooley.

" I also acknowledge that I was guilty of the attack upon Lord Middleton's gamekeeper, and that I have been engaged in most of the frame breakings which have taken place in this neigbbourhood during the last 8 months ; but I never was in *Luddism* previous to that time ; I do not, however, publicly mention the names of my associates, as it is *my most anxious hope* that they will take warning from my unhappy fate, and escape the miseries and disgrace which I now experience.

" I would exhort with the earnestness of a *dying man*, not only my immediate companions, but *all who have been engaged in Luddism*, to break off from practices, which can only involve themselves and others in trouble and ruin. When they observe a young man, just 21 years of age, and who has only been married about as many weeks, brought to the scaffold by those very practices — when they see the anguish of my afflicted wife and parents— when they pass by the church yard of Basford, and observe the graves of Bamford, Towle, and myself, — and when they consider the perilous state of these now confined in Leicester gaol,— surely they will forsake their wicked course, and all who may have furnished money or liquor, as an incentive to crime, will be induced to repent of their cruelty. We have been often told that Luddism would benefit trade, but *I most earnestly beseech all my acquaintance*, as the last request I shall ever make of them, to consider it, as leading insensibly to the commission of the worst of crimes even murder itself.

" Almost the only comfort that I now experience is, that the life of an innocent man was not sacrificed; and as I consider Kerry, and those who gave evidence against me, as instruments in the hand of Almighty God, in bringing me to justice, it would greatly increase my present sufferings, could I suppose that any should bear them ill will or malice on my account.

" I feel very grateful to Lord Middleton for his tenderness towards my brother ; and I confidently hope from the change of mind which took place in Nathan whilst he was in prison, that mercy will not be lost upon him, and that there will be no occasion to bring him a second time before a bar of justice.

"If any who have visited me prison, have thought from my silence and reserve, that I did not feel my situation sufficiently, I can assure them that I now weep bitterly for my crimes, and fervently implore forgiveness at the tribunal of Him, who once pardoned a dying criminal, and who will not, I hope, condemn me although so guilty a sinner, "to the bitter pains of eternal death."

"DANIEL DIGGLE."

TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES. LEICESTER, APRIL 2.

After a protracted trial of two days (on Monday ten hours, and Tuesday fourteen), eight of the *Luddites* have been condemned to death— in the whole, there were twelve committed. *Blackburn* and *Burton* were admitted evidences. *Caldwell*, taken in fits during the trial, remains for next Assize. *Slater*, tried last Assize, under the Black Act (that is, for shooting), was again put to trial for frame breaking, to which charge he pleaded guilty, and is to be transported for life. The names of those condemned are *Savage*, *Withers*, *Towle*, *Amos*, *Crowder*, *Mitchell*, *Clark*, and *Watson*. Much important evidence was given on the trial. Fifteen others, for various offences, have been condemned. One was seized with convulsion fits during his trial, and being reported by a medical person to be incapable of attending to his defence, was remanded to prison. The town has been very peaceable during the Assize.

TRIAL THE LUDDITES

Trial of Clarke for Shooting at John Asher.

Monday, March 31.

This morning, at eight o'clock, the Honourable Sir Richard Richards, Knight, look his seat Bench. The Court was immensely crowded, and vast anxiety was evinced to obtain situations in the Hall.

TO DO

Thomas Savage. William Withers, John Amos, John Crowder, Joshua Mitchell, Samuel Caldwell, James Watson, and John Clarke were put to the bar, and arraigned on a charge of having, on the night of the 28lh of June last, feloniously and maliciously shot at John Asher, with intent to kill and murder him. Another count charged them with aiding and abetting in shooting at John Asher, &c.

After twelve of the pannel had answered to their names, they were challenged on the part of the prisoners : and then another twelve, and so on, so that it was found impracticable to obtain a jury from the pannel to try them altogether. A proposition was made to make up a Jury from bystanders in the Court, but this was objected on the part of the Crown, and all but John Clarke removed from the bar. An attempt was then made to obtain a Jury from the pannel, but as the Crown challenged some, the Counsel on behalf of Clarke others; and some did not attend; only six could be found, and the residue were selected  from bystanders in the Court. The whole number of challenges on behalf of the prisoners had been expended when nine jurymen were in the box. An hour and a half was occupied in this uninteresting business, and it was not till half past nine, that the Gentlemen of the Jury were sworn. The following are their names—

J„hn Ch.iml'f'! .iturpli Dui-.' William "aid. Julio U-e. Jolm Lead heller Humphrey Caulvrright, William (ihiutiuo, St. Kirk, «lwlm Tbiun.i- PoottnaQ

This closed the case for the prosecution, and Mr. Balguy renewed his legal objection, and stated it at considerable length, Mr. Denman followed the same side. Serjeant Vaughan was going to reply, but the Learned Judge over ruled it. The prisoners were then tailed upon for their defence. Thomas Savage addressed the Court, but did not attempt to deny his participation in this Iranacliun. He particularly urged on the attention of the jury the characters Blackburn and Burton ; and told them he had wife and six children. If they decided according to their consciences and in the sight of God, he be satisfied. William Towle said he was not capable of saying any thing. John Crowder dwelt the characters of the two men brought against them ; had wife and five children. John Amos hive nothing to say, Lord." William Withers, have you any thing your defence? No. Lord."

They were swearing and saying Ned your duty." The men with the pistols kept guard over all the time, and said if I stirr'd they would blow my brains out; 1 was bleeding very fast; asked them if they would let me out or fetch a Doctor. was afraid I should bleed death ; they made no answer. ten minutes, they said the guardsmen, how is that man who is wounded ? the man said me, how are you ? said 1 was very bad—he asked if I could a bit longer ; I said I could if they would make haste—he said they would not be long—they went in about five minutes, i leaving bleeding; I was taken home, but before then, one the men who had come in, said, shake hands with the wounded man, but Webster put out his hand, and he shook hands with Webster. The third witness was, Mr. Palmer, surgeon, of Loughborough, who was called into Asher, and deposed to the state he found him in, having extracted a ball slug from his head, &c. &c.

Leicester Journal - Friday 11 April 1817

FURTHER TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES

LEICESTER ASSIZES

Tuesday, April 1.

Trial of Thomas Savage, Joshua Mitchell, Wm. Withers, William Towle, John Amos, John Crowder and James Watson, for firing a gun at John Asher.

On Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, the above prisoners were put to the bar, along with *Samuel Caldwell*, otherwise, *Big Sam*, and the Jury were called and sworn, without any difficulty, consisting of the following Gentlemen:—

Humphrey Cartwright  
William Percival  
John Eames  
William Flint  
Thomas Simms  
Samuel Charles Hardy  
William Southernwood  
Willian Cooper  
Alphreus King  
Thomas Penford  
John Earpe

Sergeant Vaughan addressed the Court at great length, and then called Mr. John Pidden(?), who gave evidence to the same purport as the day before.

In midst of his examination the Court was thrown into some confusion, by Samuel Caldwell, one of the prisoners at the bar, falling down, in strong convulsions. He was carried out, and bled, and in about an hour, during which time the proceedings were staid, was again placed at the bar in a chair. In about two minutes he appeared as though he was asleep, with his head inclined against Crowser, who sat next to him. Some cordials were administered to him, and the opinion of Mr. Palmer and Dr. Freer taken, as to whether he was able to take his trial, and make his defence. The latter Gentleman was sworn, and stated, that the prisoner, Caldwell, had been in a state of convulsion, arising from agitatatn of mind, which had attended to a state of insensibility. It was probable that at intervals he might be able to attend to what was going forward, but the convulsions were likely to return, and be followed by a state of syncophy. It was possible that he might not be able to take his trial any better at a future day, for the same circumstances might produce the same effects.

John Blackburn was examined by Mr. Serjeant Vaughan as on the day before, and deposed much to the same purport.

William Burton also evidence for the Crown [*sic*], deposed, that in June last he worked at Arnold. On Sunday the 23d of that month, he went to see his parents at Old Rasford, where he saw William Towle, who asked him if he had any notion of making one in a bit of a job. Witness asked him what sort of job it was, he told him it was the same as that done at Radford. Witness asked where it was to be, but Towle would not tell him; he asked him when it was to take place, aud Towle said on Friday following, about thirteen or fourteen miles from Nottingham. Witness said he had not money enough to take him so far and back again, but Towle told him there would be £5 a man and all expenses paid. Witness said he had never been in any thing of the sort, he did not care if he did go. Towle asked him where might get another, he said he might take some of them that were at Radford with him, Diggle, or Barker, or Henfrey. He said he did not like to take Diggle or Henfrey, because they drank the money for the Radford job in the middle of the week, and that led to suspicion; and as to the other he was an apprentice, and his master and him might fall out if he were away so long. Just then witness saw Watson coming up, said, there's Watson yonder, he has been a soldier, and perhaps he'll stand. When Watson came up to them, Towle asked him if he had any objection to make one in a bit of a job. Watson said no, and asked what it was, at the same time offering to find another man if he wanted him. Towle said he did not want another; it was not in going a poaching, nor nothing of that kind. Witness told him no, it was a very serious job, and not to be laughed at— Towle added it was using a bit of hammer.— Watson agreed to go and they parted, but they were to meet again on the Thursday night following. Witness got to Basford about dark hour on Thursday evening, and saw William Towle, and they appointed to meet the next morning in Damms's meadow, between five and six o'clock. He went there accordingly, and saw Watson and Towle, when the latter informed them both that job was to be done at Loughborough. The three went down the Larkdale and met a man whom witness did not know, but he seemed to know Towle, and gave him four pistols. Witness does not know that he has ever seen the man since.— The went to the Peach Tree public house, but it was not open. Hill, Mitchell, Amos, Crowder, and Slater joined them. They all went down Shaw's lane together. Soon after tbe Peach Tree was opened, Mitchell, Amos, Crowder, Slater, and C. Blackburn were present, and they had some ale and penny bread aud bacon. The landlady, landlord, and servant waited. Witness, Watson, Mitchell, and C. Blackburn went out, intending to go by the coach to Loughbrough. They went to some place under the Long Row, he did not know what the place was called, the coach was just going, and none went by it. They then went the White Lion, but that coach was just gone. They then went back to the Peach Tree, and it was agreed that some should walk and others go by the coach. Witness, W. Towle, C. Blackburn, and Watson were to walk. Witness and Watson went one way, and Blackburn and Towle another: they were to meet at the canal bridge. Those left at the Peach Tree, to come by the coach in the afternoon, were Slater, Hill, Amos, Crowder and Mitchell. They joind together at the canal bridge and after having passed the Trent, they went along the fields, when Towle produced two large pistols, which were loaded with blank cartridges, and fired them off.— C. Blackburn put on Towle's great coat, for he had a blue waistcoat and sleeves on, and he was afraid without that was covered he might be suspected —Blackburn put the pistols into the inside pockets of the great coat. Towle had a corduroy jacket and pantaloons on. Witneas had a velveteen jacket and corduroy breeches. Blackburn said it would not do to be altogether ; he therefore gave witness and Watson 5s. and they were divided two and two. Blackburn and Towle went first, and they were to join again at Bunny. He and Watson got there first, and called for some and ale and cheese, and while there the other two came. When they left that place, Towle said he and Blackburn were old hands, and the others were young ones, and therefore they would divide differently. Towle and he went together, and Blackburn took Watson— they were to join again at Hoton—they went the Bell, at Hoton— he and Towle got there first, and called for something to drink; in about ten minutes the other two came— they did not claim acquaintance just then, but appeared to be strangers. Watson had a smock frock on. A man of the name of Spencer, a gardener, was there, and there was a disturbance between him and his wife; he had been out all week drinking, and she wanted him to go home—they all sang, but had not joined parties then. Towle sung a song, the chorus of which was—

" Damn such laws, and so say I."

The man with the great coat on, kept it buttoned all the time, although it was a hot day. They sung, and one of their songs had a chorus

Thus closed the case for the prosecution ; and

The Prisoners were then called upon for their defence.

William Towle said he was not capable of saying any thing 

John Crowder dwelt on the characters of the two men brought as evidence against them; he had a wife and 5 children.

John Amos— " I have nothing to say, my Lord."

Wm. Withers, have you any thing to say in your defense? " No, my Lord."

James Watson—" I have nothing to say, my Lord."

The Prisoners generally between the age of 20 and 30, were remarkable for being fine looking young men, in the prime of life, health, and vigour. They bore the fatigue and anxiety of trial, which lasted 14 hours, with a degree of calness and composure seldom witnessed in their situation.— They called witnesses to the number of between 25 and 30 to character. These were chiefly manufacturers of Nottingham, who spoke highly in their favour.

Baron Richards told the Jury, that were meant to try the simple fact whether the prisoners were concerned in this felony, not whether their general character, which had nothing to do with the question, was good or bad. If it was a doubtful case, they might have the benefit of good characters, but not where the evidence was positive against them, as here. If the facts were proved to their satisfaction, they were bound by their oath to find the prisoners guilty. Accordingly, the Jury having found seven of them— *Guilty* — Mr. Baron Richards, in a very impressive manner, immediately passed sentence of Death on the remaining eight Prisoners, including Clarke— they were bid to expect no mercy, but to prepare themselves for the mercy of God, by a sincere repentance of that course of crime aud mischief which had set the law itself, together with lide and property of the subject, at defiance.

John Slater pleaded guilty to framebreaking, which being recorded, he was sentenced to transportation for life.

It remains to make some observation upon the origin of this outrage, which is supposed to have arisen from the following circumstances of notoriety in this county. It appeared that Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, whether from apprehensious entertained of the consequences that followed, or for other reasons, were about to remove their business to another county, which they have since done. The workmen employed, of which there were three hundred and upward, were given to understand, that if they continued their wages would be reduced to one guinea per week. This is supposed to have agitated the diabolical plan of mischief and revenge. A subscription is supposed to have been entered into by their workmen, who had recourse to the Nottingham men to do this work of destruction, for which the others are to pay them; butno evidence was given upon these trials, so as to implicate the original promoters or subscribers, farther than as to the sum of £100, which the Luddites were to receive through the medium of Withers and Savage.

[ TH: Is this rationale elsewhere described? Who was Clarke? - little sam, tried separately]

Nottingham Review - Friday 18 April 1817

COUNTY MEETING, AT MANSFIELD.

*A Correspondent has trannsmitted us some particulars of the Meeting held at Mansfield, which we are requestd to publish.*

A County Meeting was held at the Moot Hall, Mansfield, on Wednesday the 9th Instant, in pursuance of a Requisition to the High Sherriff, " to consider of a proper congratulatory Address, to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, upon his escpae from the late violent and treasonable outrage, against his Royal Person,", when:—

LORD MIDDLETON, after aplogizing for offering himself to the notice of the Meeting, observed, that at the last Assizes, a friend of his, then present, suggested the propriety of having a County Meeting, for the purpose of addressing the Prince Regent, upon his escape from the outrageous attack that had been made upon his person; he should always thank that friend, (he meant Mr. Sutton) for the suggestion: it had been said that it was now too late to address the Regent, but in his opinion, an Address, even now, would be preferable to no Address;— (Applause) — besides, he thought that the detection of the conspiracy at Manchester, and which appeared to extend to other places ; and the disturbed state this County had long been in, rendered an Address highly proper. It was the duty of very man to rally round that admirable Constitution which had stood the test of ages, and which afforded protection to the meanest peasant. "We should," said his Lordship, "congratulate the meanest individual in the streets, upon his escape from assassination; how thankful then ought we to feel, for the providential escape of the person, exercising the highest office in the State. I tremble at the very idea of the consequences, had the attack succeeded;" and he thought no man who had any veneration for the Constitution, could  object to an Address of Congratulation to the Prince, upon his escape; he had always admited the British Constitution — in that admiration he should continue to his last moments, and he was ready to die in its defence. His Lordship concluded his speech with moving the Address.

J. M. SUTTON Esq. (of Langwith) said, that he was unaccustomed to public speaking, and he therefore, hoped, the assembly would favor him with their indulgence for a few moments— he stated that evil persons had taken advantage of the times to poison the minds of the people, and to make them believe their sufferings were unheeded—he conceived it to be the duty of every man, to use his utmost efforts, to re-call the unwary to a sense of what they owed their King and their country. Mr Sutton concluded abruptly, by stating that he felt unable to proceed.

R HOLDEN Esq. stated that he had heard it remarked, it was now too late to address the Regret, he should only repeat the old proverb " better late than never." Gentlement, said Mr Holden, we ought to shew that we cannot and will not bear that the Constitution shall be attacked by any body or set of men; the County of Nottingham, sir, is I am sure as loyal as any County in the kingdom, and I think we should not discharge our duty to the King, to our Country, and to posterity, were we not to cingratulate his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, upon his escape from the daring and atrocious attack upon his person; when almost every town in the kingdom has the Regent, shall it be said, that this was the only County which had not congratulated the Prince. Sir, the county of does not deserve such censure, I therefore rejoice in the present Meeting, and beg leave to second the address.

L. ROLLESTON (of Watnall), after some very pertinent remarks, observed, that it might appear strange, that what six weeks ago was thought to b improper, should now be thought proper; in his opinion circumstances now imperiously called for an address; however in some particulars men might differ in their political priciples, yet all must agree as to the propriety of congratulating the Prince Regent, on his escape from the attack upon his person; he thought the County would be disgraced unless it addressed the Regent—" when faction rears its head, shall the County of Nottingham stand alone ; I trust that it never shall be said we did not exert ourselves against the designs of factious demagogues"——he therefore heartily concurred in the address.

Several other Gentlemen address the Meeting, and Admiral Frank (one of the County Members) declared that the County of Nottinghant was as loyal as any county in the kingdom——he always had vindicated its loyalty, and he always would; it had been declared in the Secret Committee, that this county was not infected with treason.

The following resolutions were then passed unanimously, viz. — That the Address should be presented by the Members for the County—That the thanks of the meeting should be given to the mover and seconder of the Address—That the proceedings of the meeting should be published in the Nottingham Journal, the Morning Chronicle, and the Courier newspapers. And the High Sheriff haying quitted the chair, (which was taken hy the Duke of Newcastle,) a vote of thanks was given to the High Sheriff for his ready compliance with the requisition, and for his conduct in the chair.

After the business of the Meeting was over, Lord MIDDLETON some length on the practices that had so long long been the disgrace of this county, and after alluding to his own conduct at the late Assizes, (when he withdrew the prosecutions against Mellors and two others, for shooting at his Lordship's game keeper,) said, that at the time he was afraid his conduct would be imputed to a wrong motive —that of fear; his Lordship denied that fear operated upon him. That if any future disturbances arose in this county, no motive should prevent him from using his endeavours to bring the authors to justice. That he had not spared any pains to learn the real cause of the apparently determined hostility that existed between the employer and the workmen— he had dived into gaols for this purpose. "You may," said his Lordship, " think I posses a hard heart, but I assure you I do not." He said he had been to Leicester, and there he had had an interview, with one of the unfortunate men who were about to expiate their crimes by an ignominious death. Yes, he had there seen one of the unfortunate engines, in the hands of other men, and he believed he had ascertained the cause of the unnatural rancour that had so long existed. He had asked this unfortunate man if it was not possible for something to be done to put an end to the system which had so long existed in this county; he would name this unhappy man, it was Savage, and this was the reply he made:— "My Lord," said he, "if the employer would but fix a price upon the work, so that the workman might know what he had to receive, Ludding would have ceased long ago; but the workman never knew what price he was to have. My Lord," continued this unfortunate man, "I am prepared to die— I do not grieve for myself, but I grieve for my wife, who is now pregnant, and for my six children ; it is for them, my Lord, that I grieve, and not for myself, for I fear not death " If, continued his Lordship, there are any manufacturers present, I would recommend them to endeavour to conciliate their workmen, and to try to allay that malignant spirit which has for so long a period disturbed this county. His Lordship concluded his speech, which appeard to excite considerable interest in the minds of the hearers, by a few other observations relative to the baneful practices that have so long existed in the county, but which, he thought, had now received a death blow.

Liverpool Mercury - Friday 25 April 1817

EXECUTION OF LUDDITES, &c.

Leicester, April 17.— The most melancholy spectacle ever witnessed at Leicester took place this day, in the execution of the seven men under sentence of death, viz, the six Luddites, for destroying lace machines, and firing with intent to kill, in the factory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, at Loughborough, last June; the other for arson, or setting stacks on fire, at Newbold, in the said county. The names of the Luddites were— Joshua Mitchell, John Crowder, John Amos, William Towle, William Withers and Thomas Savidge; the name of the other Thomas Beavington. As early as six to o'clock in the morning they were removed, under military escort; from the jail to the new Bridewell, to be executed on the new drop. On their way, the Ludditea very cheerfully sung hymns all the time they passed. Beavington seemed very dejected.— Many thousands of spectators kept assembling until noon to witness this truly tragic scene, and conducted themselves in the most peaceable manner. About twelve o'clock the unhappy men appeared on the platform, attended by the Rev. Mr. Hayton, chaplain to the to the jail; the Rev. Mr. Vaughan, the Sheriff, and other officers. Since their condemnation the Luddites had conducted themselves in the most becoming manner, desiring forgiveness of God, and forgiving Blackburn and Burton, (by far the worse characters) who were admitted evidence against them. Beavington,an ignorant man, was insensible of his situation to the last. Savidge thanked the Reverend Ministers for their kindness and attention on their behalf; he said he had intended to say more, but the time was too far gone, hoped the people would take warning by their fate, fear no man, but fear God; and declared their innocence of shooting.— Amos addressed the people:—" Friends and fellow countrymen! You see here six men going to suffer innocently ; the man who committed the crime will soon be at large. Take warning by our fate— Farewell." Mitchell said a few words, much similar ; and without any apparent agitation they spoke to several friends in the crowd; and threw oranges, &c. to some of them, and desired to be remembered to their Nottingham acquaintances.— When all things were ready for the fatal moment, Amos, with a firm and undaunted voice, said they would now sing a hymn, and desired the people to join them, which was readily complied with by numbers. The hymn he chose, and to which he pitched the tune, was from Dr. Watts.

All the Luddites joined very earnestly in singing the hymn; immediately after which the platform  fell, and launched them into eternity.

Beavington declared his innocence to the last, and *called God to witness* he did not set the stacks on fire.

We lament to say, that the most of these misguided men, in the bloom of life, have left *widows*, and more than *thirty children*, to add to the miseries of the present truly calamitous times !!

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 26 April 1817

The bodies of the unfortunate men executed on Thursday the 17th instant, for the outrage at Loughborough arrived at Nottingham the following morning at three o'clock in two covered carts for interment. Mitchel, Amos, Withers, and Crowder were interred in St. Mary's Church Yard, the former, (Mitchell), at about five o'clock in the morning, the three latter at about five in the afternoon ; and Savidge was interred in the New Burying Ground about the same hour as the latter, amidst great numbers of people. Towle was taken forward to Chilwell, near the place where his friends reside.

Savidge (aged 39) has left a wife and six children; Amos (aged 30) a wife and five children ; Mitchell (aged 29) unmarried ; Withers (aged 33) a wife and one child; these were natives of Nottingham. Towle, (aged 25) a wife had one child a native Chilwell. Crowder (aged 40) a wife and five children, a native of Leicester.

*Lord Middleton's observations on Luddism.* —A Meeting was held at the Moot Hall, Mansfield, on the 9th inst. for the purpose of congratulating the Prince Regent on his escape from the late "violent and treasonable attack against his Royal Person," when several Resolutions and an Address were unanimously adopted.

After the business of the Meeting was over, Lord Middleton spoke at some length on the practices that had so long been the disgrace the county, and after alluding to his own conduct at the late Assizes, (when he withdrew the prosecutions against Mellors and two others, for shooting at his Lordship's Gamekeeper,) said, that the time he was afraid his conduct would be imputed to a wrong motive—that of fear; his Lordship denied that fear operated upon him. That if any future disturbances arose in the county no motive should prevent him from using his utmost endeavours to bring the authors to justice. That he had not spared any pains to learn the real cause of the apparently determined hostility that existed between the employer and the workmen—he had dived into gaols for this purpose. "You may," said his Lordship. "think I possess a hard heart, but I assure you I do not." He said he had been to Leicester, and there he had an interview with one of the unfortunate men who were about to expiate their crimes by an ignominious death. Yes, he had there seen one the unfortunate engines, in the hands of other men, and he believed he had ascertained the cause of the unnatural rancour that had so long existed. He had asked this unfortunate man if it was not possible for something to be done to put an end to the system which had long existed in this county ; he would name this unhappy man, it was Savage, and this was the reply he made:—" My Lord," said he, " if the employer would but fix a price upon the work, that the workman might know what he had to receive, Ludding would have ceased long ago; but the workman never knew what price he was to have. " My Lord," continued this unfortunate man. "I am prepared In die—I do not grieve for myself, but I grieve for my wife, who is now pregnant, and for my six children ; it is for them, my Lord that I grieve, and not for myself for I fear not death." If, continued his Lordship, there are any manufacturers present, I would recommend them to endeavour to conciliate their workmen, and to try to allay that malignant spirit which has for so long a period disturbed the county. His Lordship concluded his speech, which appeared excite considerable interest in the minds of the hearers, by a few other observations relative to the baneful practices that have so long existed in the county, but which, he thought, had now received a death blow.
