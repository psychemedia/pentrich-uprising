# Loughborough Luddites Trial

Nottingham Review - Friday 24 January 1817

We find that James Towle, on the morning previous to his execution, made a full and particular disclosure, to the High Sheriff of Leicestershire, and to a Justice of the Peace, for that county, of every person, directly or indirectly concerned in the felony and destruction, at Mr. Heathcoat's factory, at Loughborough, and of the Luddites in general, which has been kept secret, until it could be made subservient to the ends of justice ;—he died penitent ; assured the gentlemen that what he had stated to them was true, observing, it would be of no service to him then to say what was false, and lamented that he had not made this discovery sooner, to have saved his life :—his comrades are now doing so; the Luddites are impeaching one another, and the Magistrates are in possession, we are credibly informed, of their whole history. Of the 15 men now apprehended, ten are charged with the offence at Loughborough. It is hoped that the wicked and mischievous proceedings of the Luddites are now at an end : they have driven the best part of our manufactory from the town, and the destruction of property employed in trade, has injured the great bulk of manufacturers and the public in general. We hope and trust that the time will be revived, when the ingenuity and industry of our mechanics will again raise the trade of this empire above the rest of the world ; and we feel confident, that the skill of the workman, will be powerfully aided by the great capital this country can bring into trade, whenever it can be done with security, and the master and servant are free to make what contracts they may choose to enter into with each other. As none of the men have yet been examined before the magistrates, we decline entering into further particulars until next week.

...

On the 15th instant, Joseph Mellors, Nathan Diggle, and Daniel Diggle were committed to the county gaol, for trial at the next assizes, charged with shooting at William Cooke and Francis Thorley, at Trowell, in this County.

The three men, for whose apprehension a reward was offered; they being charged with assaulting the Earl of Chesterfield's gamekeepers, have been taken up, and were lodged in our county gaol on Wednesday night; but they have not yet been examined before the magistrates.

NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 21.

Attempt at Murder.— Tuesday *Daniel Diggle* was tried for shooting at George Kerry, in his dwellinghouse, in the parish of Radford, near Nottingham, on the evening of the Sunday before Christmas Day last, with a pistol, loaded with leaden shot, with intent to kill and murder him. There were two other also indicted with him, of the names of *Henfrey* and *Wooley*, who have absconded, but, when found, will be tried on the same indictment.

The circumstances disclosed a scene of the most wicked and premeditated intent, not only to murder Kerry, but to break the frames in his house, by this small part of the gangs of Luddites who have infested and disgraced this part of the county for some time past, with impunity.

It appeared that Henfrey and Wooley brought two loaded pistols to Diggle's house, in Basford, on the evening before named, and Shaw, in the presence of Diggle and his wife, went and got gunpowder from a man of he name Pogson, and there loaded two other pistols. Henfrey, Diggle, and one Burton, then went to Kerry's. broke open the door of his house, where he and his family were sitting in peace, and Henfrey and Diggle went in and presented their pistols, demanding that the wife and family of Kerry should retire into the parlour. Kerry got up and seized Henfrey's pistol, which Henfrey endeavoured to discharge at the body of Kerry, but which Kerry turned aside, and the contents went into the fire in the room. Diggle then discharged his pistol at the head of Kerry, several of the shot corns from which entered his head, and were afterwards extracted by a surgeon.— Kerry dropped down, exclaiming he was shot, and was a dead man. Henfrey and Diggle directly decamped, Diggle saying as he went out, "I have shot him dead, he fell as dead as a knit." Henfrey, Diggle, and Woodley wanted to turn back with Burton (who had a hammer with him for the purpose) to breaking the stocking frames in Kerry's house ; but this they abandoned for the time. All these facts, with others, shewing the wickedness and depravity of the four Luddites, were disclosed upon the trial.

Diggle was convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, not only of Kerry and his family, but of Burton (one the four) who was admitted evidence for the Crown.

The Judge ( Mr. Baron RICHARDS) then passed sentence of death upon Diggle, in an impressive manner.

Diggle, with three others, stood indicted for besetting the house of Mr. William Cook, at Shortwood, near Trowell, (gamekeeper to the Right Honourable Lord Middleton) in the night between the 2nd and 2d of January last, and in company with five other persons, who have fled from justice (amongst whom are the same Henfrey, Wooley, and Shaw, who conspired to take away the life of Kerry ), and firing at Cook through his chamber window; several times, and also firing at one Francis Thorley (a neighbour of Cook's, who came to his assistance ), with pistols loaded with shot, In this prosecution Lord Middleton addressed the Learned Judge in a very feeling and impressive manner, stating, that as a dreadful example to the country was about to be made in the execution of Daniel Diggle, who was the principal person concerned in the outrage upon the person, family, and dwelling of one of his game-keepers, his Lordship did not wish for any sanguinary or vindictive proceedings against the three others in custody, and the more especially, as he had reason to believe they were the least guilty of any in the gang ; for as to one of them, when Daniel Diggle proposed to break into Cook's house and murder him, that one prevented Daniel Diggle from so doing ; and therefore, with the Learned Judge's permission, he (Lord Middleton) would withdraw all further proceedings against them, his Lordship declaring, that all proper means should taken to apprehend Henfrey, Wooley, Shaw, and the others, who, it appeared, had been concerned in the attack upon the of life Kerry, but who are equally guilty with Daniel Diggle, in the outrage in the middle of the night at Cook's. His Lordship declared that his motive was only public justice, and he thought, as to the four in custody, that end had been obtained.

The Learned Judge very pointedly complimented Lord Middleton upon the propriety of his conduct on the occasion, and in the most solemn and impressive manner addressed the three prisoners at the bar, informing them *that they owed their lives to his Lordship's interference in their favour*. The Learned Judge exhorted them to go home and break off from the gang of depredators with which they had been heretofore connected —to amend their lives. The desperate and depraved gangs of Luddites had too long been a disgrace to this county, and they must and should be put down.

NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 21. ATTEMPT AT MURDER.—Tuesday *Daniel Diggle* was tried for shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling-house; in the parish of Radford, near Nottingham, on the evening of the Sunday before Christmas-day last, with a pistol, loaded with leaden shot, with intent to kill and murder him. There were two others, also indicted with him, of the names of *Henfrey* and *Wooley*, who have absconded, but, when found, will be tried on the same indictment.

Nottingham Review - Friday 28 March 1817

ASSIZE INTELLIGENCE. COUNTY NOTTINGHAM [CONTINUED FROM OUR LAST] Tuesday, March 18, 1817.

This morning, DANIEL DIGGLE, a fine stout-looking young man, only 20 years of age, was put to the bar, and arraigned on a charge of having on the night of Sunday, the 22d of December last, entered the dwelling-house of George Kerry, situate in the parish of Radford, armed and disguised, and then and there, wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully shot at the said George Kerry, with intent to kill and murder him.

To this indictment the prisoner pleaded *guilty*, but Sir Richard Richards, having humanely pointed out to him the consequences of such a plea, and recommended him to reconsider the matter, and by pleading *not guilty*, taking the chance of a trial, with some reluctance he consented, and pleaded *not guilty*.

Serjant Vaughan shortly stated the case In the Jury. Four men were concerned in the perpetration of this atrocius act. One of them stood at the bar; another would he brought to give evidence, and the other two, Woolley and Henfrey had absconded.
  
Mr. Denman called William Burton the accomplice, but his Lordship wishing to have Kerry's evidence first, he was called, and Burton was ordered out of Court.

George Kerry (*examined by Mr. Denman*) was a framework-knitter, and lived at Radford. On the Sunday before Christmas Day, about eight o'clock in the evening, himself, his wife, his mother, Hannah Morley, and his niece (Ann Kerry,) were at home. The door was closed and latched, but not locked. Two men lifted up the latch, opened the door, and came in; they had dark coloured long green coats on, with handkerchiefs over their faces, tied up to their eyes; one was a dark checked handkerchief, the other a light faded one; their hats were slouched down; one was a taller man, the other not so tall ; at such a time one cannot tell to one, two, or three inches; they said "Advance into the parlour," but the women were so frightened, instead of obeying the order, they all went into a corner of the room; we were sitting in the house-place—the house-place is on one side of the door, and the parlour on the other. The men had pistols in their hands, which they presented at me and my family; I rose up from my chair, and seized the first man's pistol by the barrel; he was the shorter man of the two; some struggling ensued; he appeared wishful to discharge the pistol into my body; I turned it aside, and when he pulled the trigger, the contents went into the fire, and knocked out some coals; the candle stood about half a yard and a half off, and it was blown out by the firing of the pistol. I gave the pistol a twitch, but did not get it from him, I only drew out the ramrod.— *(The ramrod was produced in Court.)* I saw the other man with his pistol ready to discharge it at my head, he stood within nine inches of me, and perceiving he was going to fire, I stooped down, and when he fired, part of the contents catched my head, and the other part went into the wall in a triangular form; it was loaded with shot and slugs, and hit a tea tray fixed against the wall, and knocked it down. Two shot corns entered my head, Mr. Attenburrow (surgeon), extracted one that night, and another the Saturday following. I have reason to believe there is another yet in my head, for it hurts me a when I press on the place. I fell down, crying out, " I'm shot, I'm a dead man. " They turned round and ran out of the house immediately. Hannah Morley, my wife's sister, locked the door. I got up soon after, and would have followed the men, but the women would not let me. The whole transaction, from the time of their coming into the house, to the time of their going out, might be a minute and a half: there was not above a few seconds between the firing of the two pistols. I saw Daniel Diggle afterwards in the gaol at Nottingham; it was on the 15th of Feb. Hannah Morley and John Kerry were with me. By order of Mr. Rollestone, one of the Magistrates, the turnkey's lodge was cleared, and Diggle was brought up to me. When he came up, he shook me by the hand, sat down by my side, and asked me how I did; I replied, not so bad as you meant me to be, and he made no answer, but his colour changed. I told him I was come to see him a different form to what he came to see me, the Sunday night before last Christmas day ; he made no answer. I asked him what induced him to do so. (Here the learned Judge made particular inquiries whether any promise had been made to the prisoner, to induce him to confess. The witness maintained that no inducement was held out to Diggle either by himself, or any other person, in his hearing. Hannah Morley was present all the time, and some of the turnkeys occasionally came into the room.)— He made no answer. I asked the question several times, but still he was silent ; at last he said, he'd be damn'd if he knew what made him come. I said to him, I reckon you left me for dead, when you left our house; he said he did. I asked him what he thought of me when I seized Woolley's pistol; he replied I'll be damn'd if I know'd what to think of you. I said, you see I know, do you how who has told? Prisoner said no. I said, then I'll tell you, it is Burton ; he replied, I know'd somebody has told, by what Mr. Rollestone said to me last Saturday.— He asked me where Burton was, I told him, Leicester gaol, he said he had never seen him since he was taken. I asked him if he knew what he said when he was coming down Pearson's close, (Pearson's close is about 120 yards from Kerry's) he said he did not know. I asked him if he did not say, damn his eyes, we'll blow his brains out at the first go off; his answer was, I believe I did. I asked if Woolley did not come into the house first. He replied yes. I knew the persons both of the prisoner and Woolley very well, though I did not know them at the time. The prisoner's father lived next door to me for several years, and is a very honest industrious man —(Here the witness's feelings seemed almost to overcome him)— Diggle said Shaw loaded the pistols in his room, as he and his wife were sitting the fire. He said he expected at the time, that Woolley, Shaw, Burton, and Henfrey, were to come to my house, but when they had loaded the pistols, they put a pistol into his hand, and forced him to go; they were all in his room. I asked him where the hammer came from, that Burton had: he said from Bobber's mill. The prisoner said Henfrey got the powder at Pogson's. Hannah Morley asked him if he recollected what he said when he went out of the house ; he replied he did not know, for he ran all the way home, quarrelling with Henfrey all the way for loading the pistols with any thing but powder. Hannah Morley repeated the question, adding, did you not say, "damn his eyes, he's as dead as a nit;" the answer was, I believe I did. The prisoner said he had done that by me for which he should hanged, and hoped I'd be as favourable as I could. He said Burton wanted them to come back again and break the frames, after they had left me for dead.
  
William Burton, the accomplice, *(examined by Mr. Clarke)* lived at Nottingham. On the Sunday before Christmas day, himself, Diggle, Henfrey, and Woolley set off to break a frame at Kerry's, it was about eight o'clock, they took three pistols and a hammer with them; witness carried the hammer; Henfrey fetched it from Constable's house or garden, he did not know which, at Basford plat. Henfrey brought one of the pistols into the room loaded; the other two were loaded with powder from Pogson's. At twenty minutes past eight, the prisoner and Woolley entered Kerry's house, with pistols in their hands; witness staid at the door. When Diggle flung the door open, Kerry said, "halloo"." The prisoner had a great coat on, with a light coloured handkerchief tied on his face, and an apron round his shoulders. Diggle said to those in the house, "go in," meaning go into the parlour. THe women screeched and a little girl (Ann Kerry) came to the door, but seeing him with the hammer, she ran back again, and directly after the pistol was fired. Witness both heard and saw it; saw Kerry lay hold of Wolley's [*sic*] pistol, and heard it go off. When the other pistol wbet off, Diggle and Woolley ran out of the house directly. He asked Diggle what he could think of firing? Diggle said because Kerry had seized hand of Woolley. Witness told him he had no occasion to fire, and he replied he was damn'd mad at himself for it. Witness then said, you're always such a damn'd fool when you've got a bit of powder; O says Diggle, damn him, he's as dead as a nit. Witness and the prisoner went down some closes home. Henfrey and Woolley took another road.
  
Hannah Morley, the sister-in-law to Kerry, was examined by Mr. Denman, but as her evidence was only confirmatory of that of Kerry's it is not necessary to repeat it.

Ann Kerry, the niece, the girl who went to the door, and ran back when she saw Burton, was placed in the witness box, merely for the purpose of giving the prisoner an opportunity of asking her any question he might think proper, but he declined doing so.

Thomas Pogson remembers that on Sunday before Christmas, about six o'clock, Henfrey came to borrow some powder of him. He lent him some in a horn.
  
This witness received an admonition from the Judge, and was desired to be more guarded in future.

The prisoner was called upon for his defence. He said he did not know that the pistol was loaded with any thing but powder; he did not load it himself; and he only fired it to frighten them.

On being asked whether he had any witnesses to call, he mentioned several names, which were called in Court, but none of them appeared. After a considerable pause, the Learned Judge began his charge to the Jury; but before he had proceeded far, it was announced that one of the prisoner's witnesses had made his appearance, and his Lordship, with that humanity, which we had frequent opportunities of admiring, while he presided in the criminal court, and which we cannot sufficiently applaud, immediately paused, and ordered the witness to be sworn. It proved to be
  
Wm. Hemmett, who had known the prisoner twelve years, and gave him a good character.

It being stated that others were expected, his Lordship waited, and the next who appeared, was

Robert Willis, a framework-knitter, of Arnold, who knew the prisoner, for he had worked for witness from July 1815, to July 1816, and always conducted himself well.

Elizabeth Hemmett had known him seven or eight years; he worked with her husband, and bore a good character as far as she knew.

After an impartial and clear summing up of the evidence by the learned Judge, the Jury desired to consider their verdict; which they returned almost immediately, "*guilty, my Lord*"

His lordship proceeded to pass sentence of death upon the prisoner, which he did in so impressive a manner, as to draw tears from most persons in the Court. It was nearly in the following words:—

"*Daniel Diggle— You have been tried by a patient and attentive Jury, and been convicted on the clearest evidence of an offence, which the law has made capital. In consequence thereof, your life has become forfeited, and you must lose it in the prime of your days, and in the full vigour of your mental and corporeal faculties. You went to the house of your neighbour and friend, a man who even now speaks of your father in terms of commendation : you went along with the other assassins, with deadly arms, forgetful of your duty to your God,forgetful of your duty to society, and forgetful of your duty to your father: you went, without provocation, in the calm and tranquillity of the evening, and you did all that you could, to murder your neighbour in cold blood. I thank God that you failed in your diabolical purpose. Your crime is of that magnitude, that you must not expect any mercy be shewn you here : I should think myself accessory to the crime were I to suffer you to live, and depend upon it, I shall not disgrace myself, by soliciting mercy on your behalf. I therefore most earnestly intreat you to prepare yourself for that world, for an entrance into which I am afraid, you are quite unprepared. I have now only to pass the sentence of the law, which is, that you shall be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, there to be hung by the neck till you are dead, and may the Lord God of all mercies, have compassion on your soul.*"

These words were pronounced with so much solemnity, that they appeared to make a deep impression both on the prisoner and the Court : almost every eye was suffused with tears, and his Lordship himself was evidently much affected.

JOSEPH MELLORS, NATHAN DIGGLE, and JONATHAN AUSTIN were put to the bar, charged with having, in the night between the 2d and 3d of January, last, (in company with Daniel Diggle, the prisoner on whom sentence had just been passed, and five others, who have absconded, among whom were Henfrey, Woolley, and Shaw,) beset the house of Mr. William Cooke, of Shortwood, near Trowell, (gamekeeper to the Right Hon. Lord Middleton,) and firing at him several times, through his chamber window, and also firing at Frances Thorley, a neighbour, who came to Cook's assistance.

In this prosecution Lord Middleton addressed the learned Judge in a very feeling and impressive manner, stating, that as a dreadful example to the country was about to be made in the execution of Daniel Diggle, who was the principal person concerned in the outrage upon the person, family, and dwelling of one of his gamekeepers, his Lordship did not wish for any sanguinary or vindictive proceedings against the three others in custody, and the more especially, as he had reason to believe, they were the least guilty of any of the gang: for as to one of them, when Daniel Diggle proposed to break into Cooke's house and murder him, that one prevented Daniel Diggle from so doing; and therefore, with the Learned Judge's permission, he, (Lord Middleton) would withdraw all further proceedings against them—his Lordship declaring that all proper means should be taken to apprehend Henfrey, Woolley, Shaw, and others, who, it appeared, had been concerned in the attack upon the life of Kerry, but who were equally guilty with Daniel Diggle, in the outrage in the middle of the night at Cook's. His Lordship declared that his motive was only public justice, and he thought, as to the four in custody, that end had been obtained.

The Learned Judge very pointedly complimented Lord Middleton upon the propriety of his conduct on the occasion, and in the most solemn and impressive manner addressed the three prisoners at the bar, informing them, *that they merit their lives to his Lordship's interference in their favour*: for it appeared from documents in the learned Judge's possession, that they were guilty, and might have been convicted if the prosecution had been proceeded in. The Learned Judge exhorted them to go home and break off from the gang of depredators with which they had heretofore been connected—to amend their lives— and, in future, to endeavour live by honest industry; and to beware of ever being brought to the bar of a Court of Justice again.

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 05 April 1817

ARRESTS AT MANCHESTER.

*Manchester, March 29.* — For some time past the better informed class of society here has reason to look with an eye of jealousy upon the state morbid quiescence into which the public mind had apparently sunk, since the prompt suppression of the last Meeting by the military. Rumour and conjecture have been very active; but knowledge of the real state of the case was strictly to those holding official situations. I refer to the Declaration of the Magistrates in our Papers of this day, for the circumstances which have occurred, so far as they are officially disclosed. I feel assured that you, Sir, will be little prepared for such a discovery, and that it will affect you deeply; and your feelings will be consonant with those of every on with whom I have this day conversed. By this time (four o'clock) the alarm has in a great degree, subsided ; but every one is struck astonishment at the diabolical nature of the conspiracy, and at the secrecy with which it has been conducted. The eleven Deputies, mentioned in the Declaration having been apprehended, were assembled in a small public house on Ardwick-green, about one mile from the Exchange, seven more, in a cellar in Church-street, were apprehended under the same circumstances, and are now in custody.

All these People had their papers about them, but whether or not those papers were important, I have not learned, as the examinations have been private. Our active Deputy Constable, .Nedin, has just now passed my window, escorted by a party of the first Dragoons, having, in a coach, five prisoners, whom he has taken up in Middleton, where similar measures had been contemplated. One them is Bamford, the Deputy from Middleton to London, at the late assembly of those worthies. Nedin observes, that so active and clever were the signals made from hill to hill, at Middleton, during his short visit, that neither he nor any of his party could comprehend them.

I will now endeavour to give you account of the plot which has occasioned so much temporary confusion ;— The signal for commencement was a rocket, which was to have ascended from near St. Peter's Church. The factories in the outskirts were to have been destroyed by means of rockets, which were to be ejected from a long brazen instrument, which was formed to introduce them at the windows. These circumstances would naturally attract the civil and military force towards the outskirts, and the mob was then to have attacked the Banks, and ultimately the New Bailey and Barracks. This plot has extensive ramifications ; Nottingham, Birmingham, Derby, and other considerable towns were to be attacked at the same time; I wish the Police of those towns may be as successfully active as ours has been. It is supposed that the eleven Deputies came from all parts of the country, and that they are men of some importance in their own way.

I am glad to tell you that this town is now most perfectly quiet; every precaution has been taken ; the military force has been very considerably increased ; we have already 2000 special constables; and the Watch and Ward Act will acted upon to-night.

*[From the British Volunteer and Manchester Weekly express. Saturday, March 29.]*  
Eight persons have been arrested within the last three days, under Lord Sidmouth's warrants, and they arrived in London under the care of proper Officers Monday. We understand, that in addition to the above, eight persons arrested under Lord Sidmouth's warrants, thirteen others have been arrested under warrants from the Magistrates, who have acted with the greatest decision and alacrity. The following is the circular front the *Court News Reporter* :—

" TREASON! SEDITION ! REBELLION !

"The accounts we learnt at a late hour on Monday, are of most extraordinary and alarming nature from Manchester. We can only give as were informed. Government have been for some time in possession of information that a most diabolical plot was in contemplation to destroy the whole town of Manchester, the Magistrates, and a certain portion of the inhabitants by fire and other destructive means; the parties who were contrivers, and to be the perpetrators of this scheme, were known to the Magistrates and Police of that part of the county, at least some of them, and information of the parties was sent to the Secretary of State's Office against them, and the circumstances of their conduct amounting to nothing short of High Treason, and in consequence warrants charging the different parties with that offence were issued by Lord Viscount Sidmouth, his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, and made special to several King's Messengers, who were dispatched to Manchester to execute them. Upon their arrival in Manchester, they shared the fate which all strangers have done for some time, of being followed, watched or louted, as the slang term is among the dreadful and numerous combination, a whistle with the fingers in the mouth was the signal when stranger was discovered; and although Manchester is one of the largest towns in England, the operations of the rebellious were so well organized, that it is supposed that strangers were pretty well discovered, and their business ascertained. The determination of the combined parties was ascertained to be proceeding with so much violence and determination, that the Magistracy of that town thought it right openly to avow their knowledge of the mischief intended, by nothing less than acts of open rebellion, which they did by a public Proclamation, which was posted in different parts of that town, informing the Public that they had received information upon which they could rely, the object of which was nothing less than open insurrection and rebellion. Persons calling themselves Deputies had arrived in Manchester, not only from that district, but from numbers of other towns at considerable distance, who were engaged in a plot to attack different towns, but Manchester ?? - and the diabolical enterprise was to take place on Sunday. To counteract their designs, measures of precaution, consistent with the secrecy previously observed, had been made, and means had been prepared, it was hoped fully adequate to frustrate the horrid machinations which had been contemplated. A large military force was near the town. Notwithstanding these arrangements under the pressing and open circumstances of treason, the inhabitants, by the public notice for their personal security, were called upon to come forward immediately, to evince the abhorrence they feel at such detestible plots, and to prove their conduct to the enemies of social order, that neither courage nor power to resist, or to overcome any attack, which may be made, however serious or however sudden.

" This had the desired effect, together with numerous bodies of the military, horse and foot, poring in from all directions round the town ; notwithstanding this formidable force, an attempt was made for the projected Meeting to be held in the open air, as announced, and persevered in, but they were dispersed, notwithstanding so determined were these mischievous persons, or at least those called Deputies, or Ringleaders, that they met in houses, and adjourned three times from house to house, in small numbers, to avoid discovery and detection ; however, information of the Police, the official Gentlemen attending there from Government was so good, that all their movements were known, and eleven of them, the most violent and active, were apprehended. Five of them were Deputies from other Towns, and they were safely lodged in the New Bailey. This firm and resolute conduct of the Police, the Magistrates, and the agents, stopped the intended riotous proceedings, the numerous bodies of them dispersing, or, in fact, they were not allowed to assemble in numerous bodies. Saturday was employed in pursuing after some of the parties, against whom warrants had been issued, charging them with the crime of High Treason, and who were known to be principal movers in the arrangements making for the acts of open rebellion and destruction of Manchester, and the murder of one of the inhabitants, which were to be perpetrated Sunday night, but they had not dared to show themselves that day in Manchester, they having been dismayed in their diabolical projects, by the immense military force, and the arrangements made by the Magistrates to stop their proceedings. Dr. Joseph Heiley was apprehended at Middleton, about six miles from Manchester, while in the act of visiting his patients. Samuel Bamford was apprehended in the same neighbourhood. This man was in London in the month of December last, and attended at the Tavern Meetings of Delegates, we believe the King's Arms, in New Palace-yard, where he disputed with Cobbett, upon the question of Universal Suffrage. He is a young man, twenty-six years of age, of considerable abilities, writes poetry very fluently, and speaks it extempore. He has written lines on the Battle of Waterloo, which are spoken by Dr. Heiley with much effect. They were conveyed to Manchester and properly secured. The whole of the Traveller coach was engaged for Sunday, and eight of those apprehended were brought off by it for London on Sunday morning at six o'clock, double ironed, in the custody of two of the King's Messengers, and Mills and Platt the Police Officers of Manchester. They arrived on Monday at the Police Office in Bow-street, where their irons were knocked off, and they were ordered to be quite separate, and Officers appointed to guard them, and prevent their having any communication with each other. Their names, we understand to be James Sellers, John Roberts, Robert Kedeings, Sam. Bamford, John Lancashire, Dr. Jos. Heiley, Edward Connor, and Nathaniel Thulton. They are all of the lower orders, and extremely poor. John Lancashire can neither read nor write. They did not undergo any examination in the course of Monday."

TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES

Trial of Clarke for Shooting at John Asher.

Monday, March 31.

This morning, at eight o'clock, the Honourable Sir Richard Richards, Knight, took his seat Bench. The Court was immensely crowded, and vast anxiety was evinced to obtain situations in the Hall.

Thomas Savage, William Withers, John Amos, John Crowder, Joshua Mitchell, Samuel Caldwell, James Watson, and John Clarke were put to the bar, and arraigned on a charge of having, on the night of the 28th of June last, feloniously and maliciously shot at John Asher, with intent to kill and murder him. Another count charged them with aiding and abetting in shooting at John Asher, &c.

After twelve of the pannel had answered to their names, they were challenged on the part of the prisoners : and then another twelve, and so on, so that it was found impracticable to obtain a jury from the pannel to try them altogether. A proposition was made to make up a Jury from bystanders in the Court, but this was objected on the part of the Crown, and all but John Clarke removed from the bar. An attempt was then made to obtain a Jury from the pannel, but as the Crown challenged some, the Counsel on behalf of Clarke others; and some did not attend; only six could be found, and the residue were selected from bystanders in the Court. The whole number of challenges on behalf of the prisoners had been expended when nine jurymen were in the box. An hour and a half was occupied in this uninteresting business, and it was not till half past nine, that the Gentlemen of the Jury were sworn. The following are their names—

John Leadbetter,  
Humphrey Cartwright,  
William Robinson,  
St. John Kirk,  
Joh Simpkin,  
Thomas Footman,  
John Chamber,  
Joseph Dunslow(?),  
John Measures,  
William Ward,  
John Fowkes,  
John Lee.

Serjeant Vaughan, in a very animated speech stated the case to the Court and the Jury, and detailed to them the leading features of the evidence which would be produced.

A very neat model of the building, with some of the inside parts thereof, was exhibited upon the table.

John Boden, the first witness called, was examined by Serjeant Copley. In June last, he was partner with Mr. Heathcote, in a lace manufacturers at Loughborough. In the early part of that month, he was not at Loughborough, but came there on the 25th. The model on the table was a correct representation of the building where the manufacture was carried on. There were no less than fifty-five frames or machines in the place, finished and unfinished— twenty-three on the first floor, and thirty on the top story. The concern was in full work when he came to Loughborough on the 25th of June, and there had been an additional guard over the premises about two days before, in consequence of some unpleasant things which had come to their knowledge. They had always had one guard, John Ironman, who always acted as watchman, but this had been increased to six regular guards, and some men were kept at work in the night. On Friday the 28th June, he had been at the factory, and left it about eleven in the evening: at that time, there were six regular guards including Ironman, besides the men who were on work at the lace frames up stairs. The six guards were in the casting shop, which is a laying-to to the factory, and has an interior communication with the main building; one door leads into the setting-up room, and another into the street. The  ground floor of the factory is called the setting-up shop ; the laying-to is the casting shop ; the first floor is called the lace shop, and the second floor the top shop; these two contained the machines. He left all safe that night, and did not return again to the factory till about five in the morning; he had been sending off to inform the Nottingham Police Officers. When witness got to the factory, he found the frames broken, some entirely and some partially ; they appeared to have been demolished by hammers and hatchets: some of the beams were cut—some of the lace on the frames was also cut: the whole of the lace on the machines was destroyed, some had been cut and some burnt. The windows were also broken, apparently with stones thrown from the outside. John Asher, one of the workmen on guard that night, was wounded, witness saw him at his own (Asher's) house that day, and found he had been shot at the back of his head, but the ball was then extracted.

John Asher (*examined by Mr. Reader*) deposed, that he was in the service of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden on the 28th of June last, he was one of those who sat up as a watchman, along with Thos. Ironman, and John Webster; there were six appointed to watch. these three, and ——— Sylvester, John Barker, and Thomas German, but the last three went out; they had three pistols and one or two guns, is not sure which, they sat in the casting shop, and had good a fire— about a quarter past twelve he heard a noise, as though two men were coming up the passage, the dog barked, and a pistol was fired. He saw three or four men come up to the casting-shop door with pistols, but one had an axe; he put his hand behind and laid hold of a pistol on the shelf, which h presented to the men and attempted to fire, but it was not cocked and it did not go off. several of the men presented their pistols at him immediately and he turned his head aside, somebody then rushed into the shop, and shot him at the back of his head.

He fell down and was insensible for a time, but when he came to himself, he found himself under the workbench, with Ironman and Webster, down beside of him, and two men stood over them with pistols, who threatened if they stirred, or offered to talk, to blow their brains out ; they lay with their faces towards the ground, being desired to do so by the men over them. While he lay on the ground, he heard a great noise, as if the machines were breaking, also heard loud swearing; some called out. " Ned, do your duty," others shouted, " Well done Ned" ; this was said, while, as he imagined, the men were breaking the frames ; when he had laid about a quarter hour, bleeding very fast all the time, and afraid of bleeding to death, he replied that he might be permitted to go out, or else that they would fetch a doctor to him, to this request no answer was made. A man came into the yard soon after, and said, "How is that man that's wounded ?" but nobody answered him: the man then turning to witness said. How are you ? I said I was very bad ; he replied can you do bit longer ? I told him I thought I could if they make haste : the man said they would not be long.—The noise of breaking the machines went on all the time.— In about five minutes after, they all left the factory. When they were going out, one said he would shake hands with the wounded man, Webster put out his hand, but they said that was not the man. Palmer the surgeon was then sent for, and he was taken home.

This witness was cross-examined Mr. Balguy at some length, but material variation or new matter was elicited.

Thomas Palmer, [examined by Mr. Reynolds,] was surgeon at Loughborough, and was called up about twenty minutes past one on the morning of the 29th of June last ; he reached the casting shop about half-past one ; he found John Asher lying on his back in the centre of the casting shop, with a coat doubled up, and placed under his head as a pillow; he was faint, insensible and bleeding, with a wound on the back part of his head, inclining to the right side, made by a ball or slug fired from some instrument. Witness ordered him to be carried home, and when he was put to bed, examined the wound more particularly, when he found that a ball or slug was lodged in the right side his head. He extracted the ball at the time, and produced it at the last Assizes, but left it in Court, and never seen it since. Asher was ill five weeks.

On his cross examination [*by Mr. Denman*] Mr. P stated, that the ball or slug passed between the craniun and the scalp, from the back part of the head to the right side. It had gone round, instead of penetrating.

John Blackburn, an accomplice, *(examined by Serjeant Vaghan)* deposed that he lived at Lambley, six miles from Nottingham, in the month of June-last. He knew the prisoner at the bar about three weeks before the breaking of Messrs. Heathcoat and Boden's machines at Loughborough ; the first time he had any concern with him was at the Radford job about three weeks before the Loughborough job happened. Clarke generally went by the name of Little Sam. Witness saw him in company with William Withers about a week before the job, and told him that Withers wanted the witness and two more men for a job.— The prisoner asked where it was, and Withers told him at Loughborough, had 18l. down then to by tools or pistols with, for the purpose of attacking Heathcoat and Boden's factory, and that 40l. more was to be paid as soon as the work was done, and 6l. would be collected after and distributed amongst the men engaged ; the business was to be done the Friday after the next Friday. Prisoner told him he would not go till he was paid for the Radford job, & witness also said that neither nor the other chaps would go till then. Withers then assured them they should he paid for the Radford job before that day ; he would set with them himself. On a doubt being expressed as to the possibility of the execution of the enterprise,— Withers told them there was only one sentry, and some were to scale the walls and seize him, while the others were breaking at different places.— Sam (the prisoner) then agreed to go when was paid for the Radford job, and Withers said he would pay witness, who would then pay him. It was arranged that they were not to leave Lambley till the day on which the job was to happen on the night. There he was told of Aaron Daykin going with them, but witness did not agree to it. Withers told him that Savage, Jack Disney, Little Sam, Slater, and most of the old Neds were to be of the party. By old Neds understood, persons who had been out framebreaking before. It was agreed that he was to see Withers again at Mr. Scattergood's, the Goat's Head, in the Meadow-platts, Nottingham, on Saturday, after he had taken in his work. —and was there to receive the money due to him. Little Sam, Big Sam, and Aaron Daykin, for the Radford job. He accordingly went to the Goat's Head, and met Withers there, who gave him twenty-three shillings for himself, and the other three. He saw the prisoner in Big Sam's (Caldwell's) house on Sunday morning, when witness paid him five shillings, and they to take a walk together after dinner. Big Sam lived with Long Bill, whose real name is Tom Woodward, but who went by the name of Wing— Woodward and his wife, who was called Mrs. Wing lived on the ground floor, and Caldwell or Big Sam. in the room above. When walking together after dinner in Lovall's close, Big Sam and Aaron Daykin joined them, the prisoner said. Jack, (Blackburn) Big Sam says he'll go. Big Sam immediately said. Damn your eyes. I'll go, and Aaron Daykin said he'd go. Witness had been ordered to bring two besides himself to Nottingham, but this made three, however after some consideration, he determined to take the three with him.

They directly proceeded to Nottingham, first to the sign of Sir Thomas White, the Burgess's friend, and afterwards to Mr. Seymour's, at the Horse and Chaise, in Millstone-lane. They got to the latter place about five o'clock, and saw there in the course of the evening, Jack Slater, Benjamin Badder, and several persons he knew. Slater said to witness Jack there'd be a fine crash this week; he answerced he had heard so but had come over to learn the particulars. Slater asked whether them three chaps (meaning, Little Sam, Big Sam, and Aaron Daykin) were come over to be at the job with us; he told him they were, and Slater enquired if they would stand. Witness said yes, they would, and Slater replied they are nice-looking chaps, have they ever been out before ; he said yes, and Slater answered, they will do. Witness, prisoner, Big Sam, and Aaron Daykin slept at the Horse and Chaise that night, he in one bed, with Tom Seymour, the son of the landlord; the other three in another bed, in the same room. On Monday morning, they all set off to go to Savage's house, they stopt at the top of the street, but knew what he was going for; he went to learn at what time they were to go to from Lambley to Loughborough, and also to ask for some money, as they had been living on their own up to that time: Savage not being at home, they all went back again to Seymour's. Witness soon after went to his brother at Radford, and thence, along with Big Sam, to Lambley ; they set off about eleven o'clock. He did not stay more than an hour in Lambley, and in the afternoon, by appointment he, along with Big Sam, went to the King's Head, Narrow-marsh, Nottingham, where were sitting the prisoner and Aaron Daykin. Soon after witness and Big Sam went out. But Big Sam returned, and witness found his brother, (Christopher Blackburn ). His brother and himself went towards Savage's house, and met Withers, Savage joined them, and they all went to the Milton's Head, in Parliament-street. The prisoner went part of the road, but never went to the Milton's Head, witness told him, he was going to Savage's for money, and he returned. When at this public-house, he received one pound from Savage, which was for himself, Big Sam, Little Sam, and Aaron Daykin to support themselves with till Wednesday. Savage told him they had better be in the lower part of the town, to prevent suspicion, two in one house, and two in another; however they all slept at the King's Head that night. The money was shared amongst them equally. After breakfast on Tuesday morning, they went from the King's head, and started across the Meadows, along the Trent side, till they came to Beeston. It had been agreed they should sleep at two different places, and two of them went to the Durham Ox, the other two went to the New Inn, but as the people in the house seemed very cross, they left that place, and joined their Companions at the Durham Ox, where all four, that is Blackburn, (the witness), Big Sam, Little Sam (the prisoner at the bar), and Aaron Daykin, supped and slept that night. For supper they had beef stakes and cabbage ; the stakes were bought at a butcher's shop, Little Sam carried then home, and the servant lass cooked them. The next morning, (Wednesday,) witness and the prisoner set off by themselves, they went through Bramcote, and thence to Lord Middleton's park side, at the end of which, Savage had promised to come or send to them, with more money. They went on till they came to the Rose and Crown in Lenton, where they went in, and they sat there, saw Withers and his brother C. Blackburn, passing the window, he rapped, and they came in; after taking some refreshment, they all went back again, and when they had crossed the cut (canal)about 200 yards, Withers took out a pistol, and fired it off, saying he did so to try it.— When they got under a tree by Lord Middleton's wall, either Withers, or witness's brother, cannot say which, gave them a pound or guinea note, which was to be divided among the four. They also directed him to Loughborough the next day, where he was to meet Savage, either at the Pack-horse, or the Duke of York. Aaron Daykin was to go to Sheepshead for Jack Disney, sometimes called Sheepshead Jack; Sheepshead is two or three miles out of the way, between Beeston and Loughborough. The prisoner and Big Sam were to go the next day to meet two men with three hatchet heads in a bag, which they were get stailed somewhere on the road. Little Sam went to Nottingham but came back that night, and joined the other three at the Durham Ox, where they all supped and slept on Wednesday night; they were waited on at supper by the same lass. On Thursday morning they all went out together, Big Sam and Little Sam turned back again; witness and Daykin went to Hathern turn, where they parted. Daykin for Sheepshead, and witness for Loughbro'; he arrived at the Pack Horse, about three in the afternoon, where he found Savage and some market folks; he had been desired to take notice, but drink a cup of ale and go out, as a signal; he did so, and Savage came out directly, and they went on the road to meet Daykin and Disney, at Tyler's, the Green Man. The prisoner had desired him to tell Savage that he wanted more money, he did so, and Savage gave him 6 or 7s.; he went and gave Big Sam and Little Sam the money at Hathern turn. Witness slept in a cart that night. The next day, by Savage's desire, he went to Hathern turn, to tell the prisoner and Big Sam not to bring the hatchets into Loughborough till it was dark; he saw there Big Sam, Little Sam, Daykin, and Disney, and he delivered his message, they told him they were not likely to bring them, for they had not money to release ; they shewed him where the hatchets were at wheelwright's, the man was working at the handles, and shelving? them up. He left them with about one shilling ?? halfpence, which they said would do for them to drink till he came back with the money for the hatchets, and he returned towards Loughborough ; witness had not proceeded far before he met Jack Amos and Savage, they were coming to meet him on the road ; he told Savage that money was wanted to pay for the handles of the hatchets, and he gave him three shilling pieces to take the man for that purpose, and six shillings more for the suppers of himself and Big Sam, Little Sam, Disney, and Daykin. and also gave directions that when they went into Loughborough, they should go separately, two to one house and three to another, and by no means bring the hatchets into the town before it was dark; witness and Big Sam were to go to Tyler's, and Prisoner, Daykin and Disney to the Green Man. He accordingly went to give these directions to the men, but being tired, when he had walked part of the way, he lay down and in about half hour, they came up to him; as it was not dark, the hatchets were put in dry sough `[TH: drain; eg https://derbyshireheritage.co.uk/industrial/mines/soughs/ ]` in the lane; part them then went to Tyler's and part to the Green Man as directed; while witness, along with Big Sam, was at the former place, Savage came in, and asked Mrs. Tyler for a quart rum, which she let him have, he paid for it and the bottle; Savage then drank a glass of ale, the preconcerted signal for them to go out, for he was not talk to them ; they were just going to their suppers, he however went out directly, the other did not follow for a quarter of an hour.— Bill Towle met witness in the street, and told him they were to go together to fetch the hatchets from the sough ; about eleven o'clock they started for that purpose, and in half an hour, came hack into Ashby-lane, about fifty yards from the turnpike and two or three hundred yards from the factory. The whole party were then assembled; he saw Bill Towle, Bill Burton, James Watson, Big Sam, Little Sam, Aaron Daykin, Jack, his brother C. Blackburn, Savage, Amos, Old Crowder, Jos. Mitchell, Jack Hill, Slater, and Withers, and soon after saw Jem Towle, making seventeen all. Savage had got the quart of rum, Withers produced some fire-arms (pistols), but cannot say how many. Withers said they were all loaded, he had tried them before, and they had no need to try them again. The Prisoner had a pistol given him. They began to disguise themselves. some put handkerchiefs over their faces, some tied them up to their noses, others over their heads; some changed clothes with each other, Jos. (Mitchel) had his coat turned inside out. Savage produced the bottle of rum, and they all drank round out of the bottle. They all saw the factory in the lane, and a good deal of conversation took place respecting the attack ; some said it was a dead drop, they should get half killed before they got in. Slater, Bill Towle and Burton, carried the hatchets. They stood hesitating some time how to begin the attack, when witness said to them, damn it, will you stay here all night? some one replied, will you go first ? he said he did not care, he'd show them the place. They all set off, he leading the way, but directly two or three of them ran past him, and seized a man who was going towards the factory, they put their pistols to his head, and threatened him with instant death if did not let them in without giving any alarm, or attempting any resistance, the man knocked at the door, it flew open ; dog began to bark, and Bill Towle chopped at it with his hatchet,but missed it, and the hatchet flew out of his hand, Jem Towl then shot it, and it barked no more ; it was a great large dog. The cry was, brush forwards my lads, and he saw his brother and Watson in the casting shop ; he went in and saw three men sitting on stools, they were ordered to lie down, but instead of doing so, one of them took a pistol off the shelf, and aimed it at his brother Christopher Blackburn, witness immediately rushed by and fired at the man, and then ran out again, he saw the man fall before he ran out ; the others then lay down under a bench, and a guard was set over them. The Prisoner was fixed sentinel over a man at the door, but cannot tell how near Prisoner was to witness when he (witness) fired the pistol; knows became into the yard before the man was shot. Soon after he saw the Prisoner in setting-up shop, standing sentry over a man. Witness was placed as a guard walking from the casting-shop to Malt-Mill-lane. Witness had his brother's pistol, his brother was without one. The pistols were bought at Derby, by Savage and Withers. Witness did go up stairs ; in about a quarter of an hour after he had been placed as guard, he heard a cry of more hands wanted. Little Sam (the prisoner Clarke) told him to go up stairs ; he did so, and went into the first floor, where he saw Slater, Bill Towle, and several others, breaking the frames.— The Prisoner at that time was sentinel over one of the factory men near the outer door in the setting-up shop. Savage staid on guard in Malt-Mill-lane, where he had a woman in his care and custody ; he heard a firing of one pistol on the outside, against Malt-Mill0lane, where Savage was. After the work was done, the pistols were fired off, some fired several times, it was customary to do so on such occasions ; they also called their numbers over, and though only seventeen were there, they counted as high as about ninety, this was done in order to make folks believe there were more engaged the business than there were in reality. They went away by the Ashby road again. Before they left the place, Big Sam told Slater, who had a hatchet, to hit a desk which was in the shop against the wall, Slater hit it twice, and Big Sam took away two pistols which were in it. He saw Big Sam with a gun ; Jos. Mitchell had a musket in his hand. When they went away, they went by Garrendon Park side; they all went together as far as the Trent, except Disney, who parted with them when they had gone about five miles. They brought the hatchets and pistols away with them, and Big Sam brought the musket and bayonet away. When they got Zouch-bridge, witness's brother gave Big Sam a pistol, and he then agreed to throw the musket into the cut; he did so; they then went towards Ratcliffe, where they saw a man at plough; it was getting daylight ; they were straggling, though all the same close, he did not see any body go up to the man. They went to the Trent side, and saw a boat, into which they got, but it could not take them over; they then got out, and went to Aram's ferry, the boat was on their side, and eleven or twelve got into it first and were taken over, the others were behind ; four more came over in the boat after; Slater was in the first boat, and had a hatchet with him, almost all of them had pistols; Mitchell had his coat turned, and almost all had their faces covered. In the second boat, when the four came over, there was another hatchet; witness had flung the third into the Trent. Two men were on the other side river at the time they first came up. Savage paid for the ferrying over of the whole : he gave the man one shilling first, but the chap rather grumbled, he gave him more. When they had got across the Trent they undisguised themselves. They then separated, and witness went with Big Sam, Little Sam, and Aaron Daykin to Beeston, intending to go to the Durham Ox. Big Sam and Daykin went together before Little Sam and witness; the windows of the house were not open, Big Sam and Daykin did not stop, but just as witness and prisoner came up, the girl was opening the windows, they too went in, and calling for cap of ale, lay down on the settle and slept a bit. The lass said she thought they had been up all night. Witness and Clarke walked together as far as the Strugglers, in Lenton, but Clarke was so knocked up he was obliged to leave him in the garden. Before they had got into the boat. Savage had told them all to meet at the Fox, in New Snenton, at ten o'clock, when he would give them money. Witness went, and Little Sam (the prisoner at the bar), came in soon after.— Savage gave witness two pound, and told him to give ten shillings a piece to Big and Little Sam and Daykin, he did so, and there was ten shillings left for himself. Witness saw Clarke the next day (Sunday) Long Bill's house.

*Cross-examined by Mr. Balguy.*— The party mustered in Ashby-lane about half-past eleven ; there was a little pause, and it was he who moved on to lead them the way. Watson and witness's brother were first in the casting-shop ; witness was the third man, and all the others were behind ; they were all on the premises, within the gate. Directly as he got into the casting-shop, he saw a pistol presented to his brother; witness was alarmed for his safety and fired ; it was done on the spur of the moment, it was the result of a sudden impulse to protect his brother. The next time he saw the prisoner was when on guard at the setting-up shop ; this was the first time that he saw him after they all left the lane ; it was two or three minutes after the pistol was fired. The door of the setting-up shop opens to the yard near a pool of water.— Witness first saw the prisoner on the premises when he was at the door opposite the pool of water, he stood as sentry over a lad in the inside. Witness was taken on the 3d of January for poaching: that was all he went for, but was also charged with firing into Cooke's house ; he was then armed with a sword but not a pistol. He was taken in the fact. He knows Burton ; was taken up a fortnight or three weeks after Burton ; it was on being taken on a charge of firing at Cooke's house that he told, and he told the story for the purpose of saving his neck, for he knew he was taken on a charge that would hang him. Witness told before Burton did ; it was a week or fortnight after he was taken; he told directly of Lord Middleton's concern, but not of this till a week or a fortnight after. It was his brother who walked before Cook's door with a drawn sword ; witness had a gun, but he changed it with his brother for the sword. He began with the gun and ended with sword. Witness never discharged the gun at all, and that he will swear.
 

    TO DO
 

 William Burton, the other accomplice, (examined by Mr. Clarke) was Loughborough on the of June lasi, and know? and Boden's factory. He was in lane near there about twelve o'clock on that night, and urnty?? persons were with him; had been the lane about hour before the hatchets were brought. There were present, himself, James Towle, William Towle, the I prisoner, Clarke or Little Sam, Big Sam, Jack Disney, \aron William Withers, Savage, Joint Crowther, Amos, Slater. They disguised them- different S their c.mu, some changed their others their heads and faces, they armed imh pistols and hatche, hatchet.

 Mr. Balguy took legal objection which was decidedly over-ruled by the learned Judge.

 No evidence was called part of the prisoner, either to facts or to character; and which very remarkable circumstance, believe the prisoner was never called upon for his defence. This conceive, was owing the great attention paid try his Lordship la the arguments of the learned counsel on it objection which had been taken ; and are tjoitc coovin ed tliai it was not intentional oini-sion, but an oversighrt,have heard the outissiot. remarked, and this induces us to n(T< r our opinion of the cause thereof,
 
 His Lordship proceeded to sum up the evidence, which he did with the utmost impartiality and clearness; particularly impressing upon the minds of the Jury, the jealousy with which they should receive the evidence of accomplices, unless ronfiimed unexceptionable witnesses. In about three minutes, verdict of guilty was returned.
 
 This was nearly six o'clock, and the Court adjourned to the next morning.

This closed the case for the prosecution, and Mr. Balguy renewed his legal objection, and stated it at considerable length, Mr. Denman followed the same side. Serjeant Vaughan was going to reply, but the Learned Judge over ruled it. The prisoners were then tailed upon for their defence. Thomas Savage addressed the Court, but did not attempt to deny his participation in this Iranacliun. He particularly urged on the attention of the jury the characters Blackburn and Burton ; and told them he had wife and six children. If they decided according to their consciences and in the sight of God, he be satisfied. William Towle said he was not capable of saying any thing. John Crowder dwelt the characters of the two men brought against them ; had wife and five children. John Amos have nothing to say, Lord." William Withers, have you any thing your defence? No. Lord." James i hare iKilhing to say, Lord." A number of witnesses were called, who bore testimony to the general good character of the prisoners. His p employed full two hours summing the evidence and giving his charge the Jury, who without hesitation, returned verdict of guilty against all the prisoners. Joint Clarke was brought and placed beside of them, and Sir Ridiard passed the awful sentence of death upon eight prisoners, in very impressive terms. John Staler was then put to the bar. and pleaded guilty indictment for frame-breaking. There was indictment for a capital offence, to which he pleaded uul guilty, and the Counsel for the Crown declined ofterinjt a|, evidence, and of course was acquitted that charge. For the crime frame-breaking. His Lordship ordered him to be transported for life. Samuel Caldwell was once more lirottglil to the bar; Dr. Freer pruuuunccd Dial he was absolutely iliteiisilife, and the Jury were discharged without giving any verdict in his case. He was remanded to prison till the next assizes. 'i'll LEICESTER CHRONICLE.

LEICESTER ASSIZES.

THE LUDDITES

At seven o'clock on Monday morning a large assemblage of the principal inhabitants met at the Exchange, and being sworn in Special Constables, proceeded immediately afterwards to the judge's lodgings, headed by Mr. Mayor, with the Magistrates of the Borough, and escorted his Lordship to the Castle, when the following Prisoners were put to the bar and severally arraigned : *Thomas Savage*, aged 39, *William Withers*, aged 33, *William Towle*, aged 22, *John Amos*, aged 30. *John Crowther*, aged 40, *Joshua Mitchell*, aged 29, *Samuel Caldwell*, aged 29, *James Watson*, aged 21, *John Clarke*, aged 29. A Jury was then attempted to be empanneled, but the objections of the prisoners through the medium of their Counsel, were so numerous, that it could not be effected. All the prisoners were then ordered from the bar except John Clarke, alias little Sam, who was put upon his trial, and a Jury sworn in.

Mr. Serjeant Vaughan opened the business in a very animated and eloquent address to the Court, in which he paid high compliment to the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Mundy, who, as a Magistrate, had been principally instrumental in bringing the offenders to justice.

The first witness called, was Mr. John Boden, partner in the firm of Heathcote and Boden. Mr. B. had left the Factory at eleven o'clock on the night on which the depredation was committed ; an extra guard had been added a few nights before the outrage by the Foreman, in consequence of his apprehensions. When Mr. B. left, there were six regular guards besides the watchman ; within the Factory were 55 frames finished and unfinished, fifty-three were at work, twenty-three on the first floor, and thirty in the top story, —on that night, ten or eleven men were employed, four or five on the first floor, and five or six on the second. After the outrage had been committed Mr. B. sent off immediately to the Police at Nottingham ; when he returned to the factory about five o'clock in the morning, found all the frames destroyed, the lace had been cut and burnt upon different parts the floor, most of the windows broken, apparently by stones from the outside, and Asher, one the guards that night, he found had been shot in the head.

A model of the factory was in Court.

The second witness, John Asher: about quarter past 12, heard a noise of footsteps coming up the yard, facing the casting shop, heard the dog bark and a pistol go off, when the dog ceased barking ; immediately after saw three men in the shop, with something over their faces ; as soon as they came to the door-way, I pointed a pistol at them ; they had either two or three pistols; my pistol not being cocked did not go off; turning my head on one side, some person came in and fired a pistol at me ; I was shot at the back of head ; I was stunn'd ; when I came to myself, I found I was under the work bench, and was bleeding very fast, two men stood over us upon guard, Webster and Ironmonger were lying by me, heard a great knocking as if they were breaking the machines. They were swearing and saying "Ned do your duty." The men with the pistols kept guard over me all the time, and said if I stirr'd they would blow my brains out; I was bleeding very fast; I asked them if they would let me out or fetch a Doctor. I was afraid I should bleed to death ; they made no answer. In ten minutes, they said to the guardsmen, how is that man who is wounded ? the man said to me, how are you ? I said I was very bad—he asked if I could do a bit longer ; I said I could if they would make haste—he said they would not be long—they went in about five minutes, leaving me bleeding; I was taken home, but before then, one of the men who had come in, said, shake hands with the wounded man, but Webster put out his hand, and he shook hands with Webster.

The third witness was, Mr. Palmer, surgeon, of Loughborough, who was called in to Asher, and deposed to the state he found him in, having extracted a ball or slug from his head, &c. &c.

The fourth witness examined was John Blackburn, (one of the Luddites, who was admitted King's evidence.)

John Blackburn, examined by Mr. Sergeant Vaughan:—  lived at Lambley in June last, about six miles from Nottingham ; knew John Clerk three weeks before that time ; the first time acquainted with him was at Radford, went by the name of *little Sam*, saw him at Lambley with Wm. Withers before the Loughborough job above a week: I sent for little Sam, talked about the Loughborough job ; little Sam and William Withers were present : I told him that Savage had said they wanted him and two more for job ; he asked where it was ; I told him at Loughborough; Withers joined the discourse; said Savage had 18l. down to buy tools and pistols with to do Heathcote's factory, at Loughborough. Withers said he had 18l. down, was to have 40l. soon as it was done, and 60l. he collected afterwards ; the job was to be done the Friday following, not that Friday : little Sam said he would not go, until he was paid for the Radford job ; I said I would not until I was paid for the Radford job, and the other chaps too ; then said he would settle for the Radford job before we went. He said some were to break into the place—there was only one man on sentry—and some to break in at different places: little Sam agreed to go. Withers said he would pay me, and I should pay Sam; we were not to leave Lambley until that day on which the job was to happen at night. Little Sam talked of choosing Aaron Dakin, but he was not there. Withers mentioned Savage, Sam. Slater, and Jack Slater, and most of the *Old Ned's*, those who had been frame-breaking before ; I saw the Witness again on the Saturday following, I was to meet Withers at Scattergood's at the Goat, at Nottingham, on Saturday ; he was to pay me the money for the Radford job ; I always took the money for little Sam ; I met Withers on Saturday, gave me 23s. I gave Caldwell 15s. and little Sam was present; big Sam (Samuel Caldwell) went out of the house, and little Sam was to take a walk; this was on Sunday morning ; I took the way to Lambley. [Here the witness continued a very long detail of the meetings of the Conspirators, their receiving money, arranging their plans of depredations, &c.]—In continuaton he said—On Friday afternoon I saw little Sam at Heathern town ; Savage directed me to tell them not to bring the hatchets in till night; I found little Sam, big Sam, Dakin, and Disney, at Heathern Turn ; the hatchets were at a wheelwright's; they said I must go and get some money to pay for them being handled: I gave them what money I had, and went towards Loughborough, and met Savage and Jack Amos coming to meet us; I told them they were fast for want of money; they gave me 6s. and went back and saw little Sam, big Sam, Dakin, and Disney; Savage gave them 3s. to pay for the hatchets, 3s. for little Sam. Dakin, and Disney, and 3s. for Amos and big Sam. I went back with Jack Amos and Savage; we were to go 2 or 3 to one house, and 2 or 3 to another; I was to go with big Sam to Tyler's, and little Sam, Dakin, and Disney were to go to the Green Man ; the hatchets were to be brought in a bag ; Savage desired me to go back and tell them to hide the hatchets: I laid me down and they came up with the hatchets in a bag: it was after sun-set; we put them in dry bough under the bank.

We went to Loughborough ; Savage called for a quart of rum at the White Lion ; Mrs. Tyler delivered it to him : I then went to the Green Man and drank a glass of ale for signal; they came out, and we went for the hatchets, and then went to Ashby-lane about half-past eleven o'clock on Friday night, about 2 or 300 yards from the factory ; Bill Towle, Wm. Burton, James Watson, big Sam, little Sam, Aaron Dikin, Jack Disney, Christopher Blackburn, Savage, Amos, old Crowder, Bill Withers, Joshua Mitchell, Jack Hill, Slater, myself, and James Towle, were there ; Savage had got the rum in his pocket ; Withers produced pistols ; he said they were loaded, he had tried them beforehand, and they need not try them over again ; little Sam had a pistol; some had handkerchiefs over their faces, and some changed clothes with each other; Mitchell had his coat turned inside out. Savage had a pistol. Savage produced the bottle of ram, which was handed round; we could see the factory; some said we should be half killed before we got in— it was a dead drop; Slater had one of the hatchets, Bill Towle and Burton had each one; they stood hesitating how they were to attack ; they said, would I go first, I said I would show them the place, when some set off running, and I ran. We seized a man, he was going towards the factory, he was threatened instant death if he did not let is in without alarm ; he knocked at the outside door, a dog barked, Bill Towle chopped at the dog, the hatchet flew out of his hand ; Jim Towle shot at him; the cry was "brush forward lads." I saw my brother and John Watson in the place (in the casting shop) ; I went in, I saw three men sitting upon stools in the shop; one stood up instead of lying down, which they were ordered do; one man took a pistol the shelf, and levelled it at C. Blackburn (his brother), I ran in and fired a pistol, and ran out; I saw the man fall, he lay under a bench : a guard was put over them ; after it was all settled little Sam was set sentry over; I was fixed as a sentinel from the casting shop to the corner of Malt Mill-lane; I loaded my pistol after I had fired it; I had my brother's pistol ; after we had been there a quarter of an hour there was cry of more hands wanted, and I went up stairs ; they had almost broke the frames; Bill Towle and Slater were breaking the frames; little Sam was put sentinel over one of the factory men at the door leading into the casting shop ; Savage stood on guard over a woman whom he had in custody ; I heard one pistol fired on the outside about Malt Mill-lane ; the whole time the factory was about 40 minutes; the pistols were all fired off when the job was done, some loaded three or four times ; the numbers were called ever; we called numbers as high as 90 (having first called out the real numbers) to make the folks believe we had more than we had : big Sam told Slater to hit the desk which was in the shop ; he broke it open and took away two pistols and a gun belonging to the factory. When we came away we went along the Ashby road towards Garrendon, by the Park to Zouch bridge; altogether ; but Jack Disney parted, he wanted settling with for the job : when we got to Zouch bridge, my brother gave big Sam a pistol, and Sam threw the musket into the cut. It was getting day-light when we got Ratcliffe; we went from Ratcliffe along the Trent side ; there was boat, but it would not take us over. When we got to Aaron Ferry, twelve got into the boat, some were behind, four came after; Slater had a hatchet: went over with the first twelve; Slater was with me ; they had almost all pistols; Joshua Mitchell had his coat turned; most of them were dressed in the same way as at the factory. I had thrown hatchet into a pool of water before I got to the ferry. Savage paid for the ferry, the man grumbling he paid something more. We all undisguised ourselves when we got over the ferry, and took our own clothes, and the handkerchiefs off our faces—.— I went with big Sam, little Sam, and Dakin, to Beeston ; we stopped at Beeston ; big Sam and Dakin went by the public-house: the servant girl was opening the window; little Sam and I went in and called for a cup of ale, and slept a bit on the Settle ; the lass said she thought we had been up all night; we stopped a good while, drank the ale, and then went on as far the Stragglers at Lenton ; I left little Sam in the garden.— Savage, when we parted from him, told us we were to meet him at the Fox, at New Snenton, at ten o'clock that morning, and he would give us some more money ; little Sam came in there a while after. Savage gave me 2l. I was to give little Sam and Dakin 10s. a piece, I gave it to them and we parted.

Blackburn was then cross-examined by Mr. Bulguy. Several respectable witnesses were then called, who corroborated the evidence given in all the material points, and after a very minute summing of the whole by his Lordship, the Jury in a few minutes returned a verdict— *Guilty*.

On the following morning the Court met at 8 o'clock, and did not finish till after 11 o'clock at night. Thomas Savage, William Withers, William Towle, John Crowther, Joshua Mitchell, John Amos, and James Watson, were severally found guilty ; and with the above John Clarke received sentence of death.

Samuel Caldwell, or big Sam, who should also have been tried, fainted away in Court, and was in a fit for a considerable time. He was declared by the Professional Gentlemen who attended him the be too ill know what he was about, and his trial stands over for the next assizes. John Slater, another of the accomplices (who was tried with Towle, since executed) was indicted another count, to which he pleaded guilty, and is to be transported for life.

John Clarke, or little Sam, after his commitment to goal [*sic*], had the evidence of Blackburn read over to him by Mr. Mundy, upon which he burst into tears, and said, it was quite true in every respect, as far as he was concerned, and requested to sign each sheet of the deposition, which he was permitted to do. He is to be transported for life.

Burton, another of the Luddites who was with Blackburn, was also admitted King's evidence. This man was principal evidence against Daniel Diggle, at Nottingham, for shooting George Kerry. Diggle was executed at Nottingham on Wednesday.

His Lordship, after a most fatiguing Assize, left for Coventry, about nine o'clock on Wednesday morning, leaving the following prisoners for execution :— Thomas Savage, Joshua Mitchell, William Towle, John Amos, William Withers, and John Crowther, Luddites; Thomas Belvington, for setting fire to a stack ; Robert Goadby for burglary ; and James Crofts, for highway robbery.

Leicester Journal - Friday 11 April 1817

EXECUTION OF D. DIGGLE.

On Wednesday morning, the 2d instant, Daniel Diggle suffered the awful sentence of the law, on a temporary gallows, erected in the front of the county gaol, at Nottingham, conformably to his sentence at the last assizes. This unfortunate man was a native of basford, near Nottingham, and was convicted of shooting at George Kerry, in his dwelling  house, in the parish of Radford, (in company with other persons, who are still at large), on the evening of Sunday the 22d December last, with the intent to kill and murder him. From the time the decision of the Judge was made known to him, his only anxiety appeared to be how he might best prepare himself for another world. He fully admitted his guilt ; and his sorrow and contrition, not only on account of the crime for which he suffered, but the numerous other errors of his past life, was apparently deep and sincere. He conducted himself to the last moment with becoming resignation, and we trust, by the attentions paid to him by the Reverend Chaplain, and another worthy divine, who had daily visited him, he left the world supported by a rational hope of mercy, through all the sufficient merits of a crucified Redeemer. About 8 o'clock the culprit was brought forth through the County Hall door, in a light cart, along the platform raised on the steps, under the fatal tree. He appeared firm and collected, and addressing himself to the numerous spectators, said, it was " Ludding" that brought him to that untimely end:— he expressed his regret that he neglected the good advice given him by his parents, and that he had not abandoned his wicked courses in time to avert the dreadful fate that awaited him, and exhorted all present to take warning by his untimely end. After a few minutes spent in prayer, the cart was drawn off, and he was launched into eternity.— His last words were, " Lord have mercy upon my soul !" After hanging the usual time, his body was cut down, and delivered to his friends for interment. He was a stout good looking man, but extremely illiterate. had just attained his 21st year, and had not long been married.

The particulars of the trial of Diggle have already been published; but since it may be gratifying to some persons to possess some short notice of his Prison Thoughts, a friend who visited him during the last week of his life, has furnished us with the following particulars:—

On my first interview with the prisoner, he appeared rather unconcerned, but a degree of natural reserve seemed to account in some measure for the circumstance. In all my subsequent visits he conversed frankly on the events of his past life; and manifested a degree of contrition (especially in his devotions), winch was very becoming his awful situation.— Whenever he adverted to his contempt of the advice of his parents, he was very deeply affected.

When he mentioned Luddism, which was frequently the case, he severely reprobated a system, in which he had latterly been an active, though a subordinate agent ; and he remarked with a feeling severity, upon the guilt and cruelty of the secret promoters of that practice, whom he declared that he considered equally criminal with himself.

On the Monday before he suffered, he had formed the resolution of speaking freely on the subject of Luddism and his other crimes, from the scaffold;  but fearing that his feelings might possibly prevent him, he desired that his sentiments might be written down, and published after his execution.

The following is the confession he earnestly desired might be published:—
  
" I, Daniel Diggle, being about to suffer death, and fearing that I may not be able to unburthen my mind at the place of execution, hare requested a friend to write down the following remarks and confession, to be made public after my decease.

" I freely acknowledge my guilt with respect to the particular crime for which I am to suffer; yet I declare, that when I entered Kerry's house, I had no intention of taking away his life, and that I never thought of injuring him, until he seized Wooley.

" I also acknowledge that I was guilty of the attack upon Lord Middleton's gamekeeper, and that I have been engaged in most of the frame breakings which have taken place in this neighbourhood during the last 8 months ; but I never was in *Luddism* previous to that time ; I do not, however, publicly mention the names of my associates, as it is *my most anxious hope* that they will take warning from my unhappy fate, and escape the miseries and disgrace which I now experience.

" I would exhort with the earnestness of a *dying man*, not only my immediate companions, but *all who have been engaged in Luddism*, to break off from practices, which can only involve themselves and others in trouble and ruin. When they observe a young man, just 21 years of age, and who has only been married about as many weeks, brought to the scaffold by those very practices — when they see the anguish of my afflicted wife and parents— when they pass by the church yard of Basford, and observe the graves of Bamford, Towle, and myself, — and when they consider the perilous state of these now confined in Leicester gaol,— surely they will forsake their wicked course, and all who may have furnished money or liquor, as an incentive to crime, will be induced to repent of their cruelty. We have been often told that Luddism would benefit trade, but *I most earnestly beseech all my acquaintance*, as the last request I shall ever make of them, to consider it, as leading insensibly to the commission of the worst of crimes even murder itself.

" Almost the only comfort that I now experience is, that the life of an innocent man was not sacrificed; and as I consider Kerry, and those who gave evidence against me, as instruments in the hand of Almighty God, in bringing me to justice, it would greatly increase my present sufferings, could I suppose that any should bear them ill will or malice on my account.

" I feel very grateful to Lord Middleton for his tenderness towards my brother ; and I confidently hope from the change of mind which took place in Nathan whilst he was in prison, that mercy will not be lost upon him, and that there will be no occasion to bring him a second time before a bar of justice.

"If any who have visited me prison, have thought from my silence and reserve, that I did not feel my situation sufficiently, I can assure them that I now weep bitterly for my crimes, and fervently implore forgiveness at the tribunal of Him, who once pardoned a dying criminal, and who will not, I hope, condemn me although so guilty a sinner, "to the bitter pains of eternal death."

"DANIEL DIGGLE."  
County Gaol, Nottingham.  
Tuesday Afternoon, April 1st, 1817.  
Witness-— Thomas Wright [*Nottingham Journal*]

FURTHER TRIAL OF THE LUDDITES

LEICESTER ASSIZES

Tuesday, April 1.

Trial of Thomas Savage, Joshua Mitchell, Wm. Withers, William Towle, John Amos, John Crowder and James Watson, for firing a gun at John Asher.

On Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, the above prisoners were put to the bar, along with *Samuel Caldwell*, otherwise, *Big Sam*, and the Jury were called and sworn, without any difficulty, consisting of the following Gentlemen:—

Humphrey Cartwright  
William Percival  
John Eames  
William Flint  
Thomas Simms  
Samuel Charles Hardy  
William Southernwood  
Willian Cooper  
Alphreus King  
Thomas Penford  
John Earpe

Sergeant Vaughan addressed the Court at great length, and then called Mr. John Pidden(?), who gave evidence to the same purport as the day before.

In midst of his examination the Court was thrown into some confusion, by Samuel Caldwell, one of the prisoners at the bar, falling down, in strong convulsions. He was carried out, and bled, and in about an hour, during which time the proceedings were staid, was again placed at the bar in a chair. In about two minutes he appeared as though he was asleep, with his head inclined against Crowser, who sat next to him. Some cordials were administered to him, and the opinion of Mr. Palmer and Dr. Freer taken, as to whether he was able to take his trial, and make his defence. The latter Gentleman was sworn, and stated, that the prisoner, Caldwell, had been in a state of convulsion, arising from agitatatn of mind, which had attended to a state of insensibility. It was probable that at intervals he might be able to attend to what was going forward, but the convulsions were likely to return, and be followed by a state of syncophy. It was possible that he might not be able to take his trial any better at a future day, for the same circumstances might produce the same effects.

John Blackburn was examined by Mr. Serjeant Vaughan as on the day before, and deposed much to the same purport.

William Burton also evidence for the Crown [*sic*], deposed, that in June last he worked at Arnold. On Sunday the 23d of that month, he went to see his parents at Old Rasford, where he saw William Towle, who asked him if he had any notion of making one in a bit of a job. Witness asked him what sort of job it was, he told him it was the same as that done at Radford. Witness asked where it was to be, but Towle would not tell him; he asked him when it was to take place, and Towle said on Friday following, about thirteen or fourteen miles from Nottingham. Witness said he had not money enough to take him so far and back again, but Towle told him there would be £5 a man and all expenses paid. Witness said he had never been in any thing of the sort, he did not care if he did go. Towle asked him where might get another, he said he might take some of them that were at Radford with him, Diggle, or Barker, or Henfrey. He said he did not like to take Diggle or Henfrey, because they drank the money for the Radford job in the middle of the week, and that led to suspicion; and as to the other he was an apprentice, and his master and him might fall out if he were away so long. Just then witness saw Watson coming up, said, there's Watson yonder, he has been a soldier, and perhaps he'll stand. When Watson came up to them, Towle asked him if he had any objection to make one in a bit of a job. Watson said no, and asked what it was, at the same time offering to find another man if he wanted him. Towle said he did not want another; it was not in going a poaching, nor nothing of that kind. Witness told him no, it was a very serious job, and not to be laughed at— Towle added it was using a bit of hammer.— Watson agreed to go and they parted, but they were to meet again on the Thursday night following. Witness got to Basford about dark hour on Thursday evening, and saw William Towle, and they appointed to meet the next morning in Damms's meadow, between five and six o'clock. He went there accordingly, and saw Watson and Towle, when the latter informed them both that job was to be done at Loughborough. The three went down the Larkdale and met a man whom witness did not know, but he seemed to know Towle, and gave him four pistols. Witness does not know that he has ever seen the man since.— The went to the Peach Tree public house, but it was not open. Hill, Mitchell, Amos, Crowder, and Slater joined them. They all went down Shaw's lane together. Soon after the Peach Tree was opened, Mitchell, Amos, Crowder, Slater, and C. Blackburn were present, and they had some ale and penny bread and bacon. The landlady, landlord, and servant waited. Witness, Watson, Mitchell, and C. Blackburn went out, intending to go by the coach to Loughbrough. They went to some place under the Long Row, he did not know what the place was called, the coach was just going, and none went by it. They then went the White Lion, but that coach was just gone. They then went back to the Peach Tree, and it was agreed that some should walk and others go by the coach. Witness, W. Towle, C. Blackburn, and Watson were to walk. Witness and Watson went one way, and Blackburn and Towle another: they were to meet at the canal bridge. Those left at the Peach Tree, to come by the coach in the afternoon, were Slater, Hill, Amos, Crowder and Mitchell. They joind together at the canal bridge and after having passed the Trent, they went along the fields, when Towle produced two large pistols, which were loaded with blank cartridges, and fired them off.— C. Blackburn put on Towle's great coat, for he had a blue waistcoat and sleeves on, and he was afraid without that was covered he might be suspected —Blackburn put the pistols into the inside pockets of the great coat. Towle had a corduroy jacket and pantaloons on. Witness had a velveteen jacket and corduroy breeches. Blackburn said it would not do to be altogether ; he therefore gave witness and Watson 5s. and they were divided two and two. Blackburn and Towle went first, and they were to join again at Bunny. He and Watson got there first, and called for some and ale and cheese, and while there the other two came. When they left that place, Towle said he and Blackburn were old hands, and the others were young ones, and therefore they would divide differently. Towle and he went together, and Blackburn took Watson— they were to join again at Hoton—they went the Bell, at Hoton— he and Towle got there first, and called for something to drink; in about ten minutes the other two came— they did not claim acquaintance just then, but appeared to be strangers. Watson had a smock frock on. A man of the name of Spencer, a gardener, was there, and there was a disturbance between him and his wife; he had been out all week drinking, and she wanted him to go home—they all sang, but had not joined parties then. Towle sung a song, the chorus of which was—

" Damn such laws, and so say I."

A skinner came in, and had a biggish rough dog with him, which was taken a good deal of notice of. Towle complained that he had nothing to eat that day, and he wanted something. The skinner replied, that the Landlord was a butcher, and they might have something he dare say. Some mutton chops was therefore ordered and cooked. Towle said to Blackburm and Watson, you may as well join us, we are all on the tramp, and we'll go together. Upon this they all joined at the mutton chops. They staid four or five hours, and all went away together. THis was about half past 4 o'clock, they went on the road to Loughborough. As they were going, a coach passed them, on which were Hill and Mitchell, coming from Nottingham.— When the coach first appeared in sight, Blackburn and Towle went over a gate into a close, but when it was gone by they came out again, and altogether went forwards to Loughborough. When they drew near, one person in a green coat met them, whom he did not know, but the man knew Towle and Blackburn, and turned back with them. Witness and Towle went to the Seven Stars, the man in a green coat went with them, drank once and then went away; several other persons were drinking in the room at the same time. Blackburn and Watson came to the Seven Stars in about two hours; it was a hot day; they by themselves apart. C. Blackburn kept his coat buttoned on purpose that persons might not see his pistols, for he said he was afraid the people at Hoton had seen them.— They sang at the house, Towle sung the same song as t Hoton. It was almost six o'clock when they got there, and they staid till ten, when the Landlord wished them to go, as he made a common rule to shut up his house at that hour. They accordingly left the house, and strolled about the town, and loaded the pistols with powder and ball; there were four pistols, Towle loaded one, Blackburn another, and Watson another; did not know who loaded the fourth, but all four were loaded.—None of them went to any other house. C. Blackburn said they were to have gone to the Pack Horse, to have light some chaps there, but they did not go. They met with a man who knew Blackburn, and took them up two or three streets, and shewed them the road to the Factory. They went into a lane near the Factory, and found some of the party, and were soon joined by more to the number of seventeen. The witness then went through the circumstances of the case from that period till they separated after crossing Aaron's Ferry, nearly in the same words as on the day before.

John Alsop lives at Hoton, is a butcher now, but at the time of the breaking of the frames at Heathcote's Factory, he kept the sign of the Bell. —.About half past two o'clock in the afternoon of that day, two men came into the house and called for a cup of ale, one of them had a pair of trowsers on, and a sleeve waistcoat of fustain or  what they call velveteen; the other had a corduroy jacket on. In about ten minutes, two more men came in, one had a blue smock frock and a furred hat, the other had a big coat on. They drank separately at first, and he did not think they knew each other at first. In a little time they joined company. They asked for a mutton chop, it was cooked for them and they eat it. Young, a fellmonger or skinner, was in the house, as well as Spencer, a gardener—Spencer's wife came in, and jarred with her husband, because he had been drinking. Witness asked the men where they were going, and they said they were stocking makers seeking work. In consequence of something said to him by Young, he went to one side of the house, and looked at the man with the big coat, and he had a pistol his pocket; he went on the contrary side of the room, and saw another pistol in the other inside pocket; soon after he buttoned up his coat, so that witness could not see the pistols.— The two men that came in first ordered the mutton chop; they all partook of it. The Sunday after Leicester Assizes, which ended on Saturday night, he saw two of those men coming along the road.— It was Towle and Watson; he asked how they did, and enquired of Wm. Towle whether he had been to Leicester, and how they had gone on at the Assizes; he did not know Towle's mane then.— Towle  said that he heard that a man of the name of Towle was to suffer, but he seemed to wish to avoid the conversation; they walked on sharpish, saying they wanted to get to Nottingham by six o'clock. These two men did not come into his house the night the frames were broken, together; they came in separately. Towle had a corduroy jacket and trowsers on.— Burton was shewn to witness, and he declared that he was one of the four men who came to his house that afternoon.
  
——— Young, a fellmonger, remembers the frame breaking at Loughborough, and was at the Blue Bell, Hoton, the afternoon previous thereto. Four men were there, and a gardener, who had an altercation with his wife. This witness pointed out Towle and Watson from among the prisoners, as being two of the four men. They sat different in parts of the house, and appeared to be strangers to each other. Watson had a blue smock frock on, and one of them, whom he did not see amongst the prisoners, had a large great coat, which was unbuttoned, and he observed a pistol in each inside pocket. One pistol was with the muzzle upwards, the other downwards. Witness pointed this circumstance out to the Landlord, and after he had been into the room to view them, the man buttoned up his coat. This witness identified Burton as having been Towle's companion at that time. He had a large dog with him which was much noticed. Towle sung a song, and some part of it was in these words
  
"Damn such laws, and so say I."
  
Henry Staples kept the Seven Stars at Loughborough, in June last. About half past five o'clock on the night when Heathcote's Factory was demolished, four strangers came into his house. One had a light coloured top coat on ; another a velveteen jacket and corded small clothes; the third had a smock frock on; and the fourth a jacket and trousers. The man with the great coat on, kept it buttoned all the time, although it was a hot day. They sung, and one of their songs had a chorus
  
"Damn such laws, and so say I."
  
They went away about nine, in consequence of his telling them that he made point a point of closing his house at ten o'clock.

Richard Woolley is a soldier the 3d, or King's Dragoons. He saw Hudson and Disney together in Loughborough on Thursday. Hudson goes by the name of Aston Daykin, but Hudson is his proper name. Witness spoke to him in the street, but as he did not answer, supposed he did hear him. The same afternoon, about 3 o'clock, he saw these two, and another (Blackburn) at Tyler's. In the course of an hour, some man brought some beef steakes on a skewer, and desired they might be cooked, there was about six pounds of them, and Mrs. Tyler cooked a part. Witness assisted in cooking and taking in the things, and was invited to partake, he did so; there were four men present, Sheepshead Jack, Hudson, Blackburn, and another. Some of them went out without eating any of the meat, none of them slept there that night, but next morning, about six o'clock, Disney and Hudson came, and they, along with witness, finished them.

George Watson was employed by Mr. Hadderley, who occupies at small quarry at Mountsorrel. On the night previous to the breaking of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden's frames, he lost some tools from the quarry; three hammers, one 20lbs. one about ten, and the other smaller ; an iron bar, 4 feet long, was also missing.
  
Thomas Phipps was a labourer employed on the road between Loughborough and Montsorrel. On Friday he found te above tools in a ditch amongst some nettles and weeds; he lodged them at the turnpike house, where they were afterwards claimed by Mr. Hadderley.
  
George Hutchinson, the Landlord of the Duke of York, in Loughborough, proved that Savage, Mitcheil, and Blackburn frequently came to his house the few days previous to the breaking of Heathcote's frames.
  
Ann Mackie lived in Miil street, in Loughborough, near the Factory at the time the machines were broken; the house in which she lived joins the Factory. Hearing a noise and the talking of men, she was induced to go out of her house to see what was the matter; her husband was employed at the Factory. As she was proceeding to the Factory, one man came up, and clapped a pistol to her head, then another man with a pistol on the other side; they soon delivered her into the custody of somebody else, whom she swore to as being Savage. He had an handkerchief on his face, but it fell off several times ; she was in fear for her life every moment. Mitchell and Crowder were there; they came up to shake hands with her before she was set at liberty

On her *cross-examination* she said she did not see Mitchell and Crowder above a minute; she cannot tell whether it was a moon light night or not, but yet she can swear to them.
  
John Bowering was in the service of Wethering and Co. at Derby, and proved that Witness purchased a pair of pistols of him, for 30s on the 26th of June last.
  
James Lawson, a constable of Nottingham, saw Crowther on the morning after the attack on the Factory, asleep, and apparently very dirty and fatigued, at the Goat in the Meadow plaits
  
Benjamin Barns met Caldwell on Leuton Sands a little after seven o'clock on Saturday morning.— Soon after he met Mitchell, and in a while after he met James Towle.

Thus closed the case for the prosecution ; and

The Prisoners were then called upon for their defence.

William Towle said he was not capable of saying any thing.

John Crowder dwelt on the characters of the two men brought as evidence against them; he had a wife and 5 children.

John Amos— " I have nothing to say, my Lord."

Wm. Withers, have you any thing to say in your defense? " No, my Lord."

James Watson—" I have nothing to say, my Lord."

The Prisoners generally between the age of 20 and 30, were remarkable for being fine looking young men, in the prime of life, health, and vigour. They bore the fatigue and anxiety of trial, which lasted 14 hours, with a degree of calmness and composure seldom witnessed in their situation.— They called witnesses to the number of between 25 and 30 to character. These were chiefly manufacturers of Nottingham, who spoke highly in their favour.

Baron Richards told the Jury, that were meant to try the simple fact whether the prisoners were concerned in this felony, not whether their general character, which had nothing to do with the question, was good or bad. If it was a doubtful case, they might have the benefit of good characters, but not where the evidence was positive against them, as here. If the facts were proved to their satisfaction, they were bound by their oath to find the prisoners guilty. Accordingly, the Jury having found seven of them— *Guilty* — Mr. Baron Richards, in a very impressive manner, immediately passed sentence of Death on the remaining eight Prisoners, including Clarke— they were bid to expect no mercy, but to prepare themselves for the mercy of God, by a sincere repentance of that course of crime and mischief which had set the law itself, together with lide and property of the subject, at defiance.

John Slater pleaded guilty to framebreaking, which being recorded, he was sentenced to transportation for life.

It remains to make some observation upon the origin of this outrage, which is supposed to have arisen from the following circumstances of notoriety in this county. It appeared that Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, whether from apprehensions entertained of the consequences that followed, or for other reasons, were about to remove their business to another county, which they have since done. The workmen employed, of which there were three hundred and upward, were given to understand, that if they continued their wages would be reduced to one guinea per week. This is supposed to have agitated the diabolical plan of mischief and revenge. A subscription is supposed to have been entered into by their workmen, who had recourse to the Nottingham men to do this work of destruction, for which the others are to pay them; but no evidence was given upon these trials, so as to implicate the original promoters or subscribers, farther than as to the sum of £100, which the Luddites were to receive through the medium of Withers and Savage.

[ TH: Is this rationale elsewhere described? Who was Clarke? - little sam, tried separately]

Nottingham Review - Friday 18 April 1817

COUNTY MEETING, AT MANSFIELD.

*A Correspondent has transmitted us some particulars of the Meeting held at Mansfield, which we are requested to publish.*

A County Meeting was held at the Moot Hall, Mansfield, on Wednesday the 9th Instant, in pursuance of a Requisition to the High Sherriff, " to consider of a proper congratulatory Address, to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, upon his escape from the late violent and treasonable outrage, against his Royal Person,", when:—

LORD MIDDLETON, after aplogizing for offering himself to the notice of the Meeting, observed, that at the last Assizes, a friend of his, then present, suggested the propriety of having a County Meeting, for the purpose of addressing the Prince Regent, upon his escape from the outrageous attack that had been made upon his person; he should always thank that friend, (he meant Mr. Sutton) for the suggestion: it had been said that it was now too late to address the Regent, but in his opinion, an Address, even now, would be preferable to no Address;— (Applause) — besides, he thought that the detection of the conspiracy at Manchester, and which appeared to extend to other places ; and the disturbed state this County had long been in, rendered an Address highly proper. It was the duty of very man to rally round that admirable Constitution which had stood the test of ages, and which afforded protection to the meanest peasant. "We should," said his Lordship, "congratulate the meanest individual in the streets, upon his escape from assassination; how thankful then ought we to feel, for the providential escape of the person, exercising the highest office in the State. I tremble at the very idea of the consequences, had the attack succeeded;" and he thought no man who had any veneration for the Constitution, could  object to an Address of Congratulation to the Prince, upon his escape; he had always admitted the British Constitution — in that admiration he should continue to his last moments, and he was ready to die in its defence. His Lordship concluded his speech with moving the Address.

J. M. SUTTON Esq. (of Langwith) said, that he was unaccustomed to public speaking, and he therefore, hoped, the assembly would favor him with their indulgence for a few moments— he stated that evil persons had taken advantage of the times to poison the minds of the people, and to make them believe their sufferings were unheeded—he conceived it to be the duty of every man, to use his utmost efforts, to re-call the unwary to a sense of what they owed their King and their country. Mr Sutton concluded abruptly, by stating that he felt unable to proceed.

R HOLDEN Esq. stated that he had heard it remarked, it was now too late to address the Regret, he should only repeat the old proverb " better late than never." Gentlemen, said Mr Holden, we ought to shew that we cannot and will not bear that the Constitution shall be attacked by any body or set of men; the County of Nottingham, sir, is I am sure as loyal as any County in the kingdom, and I think we should not discharge our duty to the King, to our Country, and to posterity, were we not to cingratulate his Royal Highness the Prince Regent, upon his escape from the daring and atrocious attack upon his person; when almost every town in the kingdom has the Regent, shall it be said, that this was the only County which had not congratulated the Prince. Sir, the county of does not deserve such censure, I therefore rejoice in the present Meeting, and beg leave to second the address.

L. ROLLESTON (of Watnall), after some very pertinent remarks, observed, that it might appear strange, that what six weeks ago was thought to b improper, should now be thought proper; in his opinion circumstances now imperiously called for an address; however in some particulars men might differ in their political principles, yet all must agree as to the propriety of congratulating the Prince Regent, on his escape from the attack upon his person; he thought the County would be disgraced unless it addressed the Regent—" when faction rears its head, shall the County of Nottingham stand alone ; I trust that it never shall be said we did not exert ourselves against the designs of factious demagogues"——he therefore heartily concurred in the address.

Several other Gentlemen address the Meeting, and Admiral Frank (one of the County Members) declared that the County of Nottingham was as loyal as any county in the kingdom——he always had vindicated its loyalty, and he always would; it had been declared in the Secret Committee, that this county was not infected with treason.

The following resolutions were then passed unanimously, viz. — That the Address should be presented by the Members for the County—That the thanks of the meeting should be given to the mover and seconder of the Address—That the proceedings of the meeting should be published in the Nottingham Journal, the Morning Chronicle, and the Courier newspapers. And the High Sheriff haying quitted the chair, (which was taken hy the Duke of Newcastle,) a vote of thanks was given to the High Sheriff for his ready compliance with the requisition, and for his conduct in the chair.

After the business of the Meeting was over, Lord MIDDLETON some length on the practices that had so long long been the disgrace of this county, and after alluding to his own conduct at the late Assizes, (when he withdrew the prosecutions against Mellors and two others, for shooting at his Lordship's game keeper,) said, that at the time he was afraid his conduct would be imputed to a wrong motive —that of fear; his Lordship denied that fear operated upon him. That if any future disturbances arose in this county, no motive should prevent him from using his endeavours to bring the authors to justice. That he had not spared any pains to learn the real cause of the apparently determined hostility that existed between the employer and the workmen— he had dived into gaols for this purpose. "You may," said his Lordship, " think I posses a hard heart, but I assure you I do not." He said he had been to Leicester, and there he had had an interview, with one of the unfortunate men who were about to expiate their crimes by an ignominious death. Yes, he had there seen one of the unfortunate engines, in the hands of other men, and he believed he had ascertained the cause of the unnatural rancour that had so long existed. He had asked this unfortunate man if it was not possible for something to be done to put an end to the system which had so long existed in this county; he would name this unhappy man, it was Savage, and this was the reply he made:— "My Lord," said he, "if the employer would but fix a price upon the work, so that the workman might know what he had to receive, Ludding would have ceased long ago; but the workman never knew what price he was to have. My Lord," continued this unfortunate man, "I am prepared to die— I do not grieve for myself, but I grieve for my wife, who is now pregnant, and for my six children ; it is for them, my Lord, that I grieve, and not for myself, for I fear not death " If, continued his Lordship, there are any manufacturers present, I would recommend them to endeavour to conciliate their workmen, and to try to allay that malignant spirit which has for so long a period disturbed this county. His Lordship concluded his speech, which appeared to excite considerable interest in the minds of the hearers, by a few other observations relative to the baneful practices that have so long existed in the county, but which, he thought, had now received a death blow.

Liverpool Mercury - Friday 25 April 1817

EXECUTION OF LUDDITES, &c.

Leicester, April 17.— The most melancholy spectacle ever witnessed at Leicester took place this day, in the execution of the seven men under sentence of death, viz, the six Luddites, for destroying lace machines, and firing with intent to kill, in the factory of Messrs. Heathcote and Boden, at Loughborough, last June; the other for arson, or setting stacks on fire, at Newbold, in the said county. The names of the Luddites were— Joshua Mitchell, John Crowder, John Amos, William Towle, William Withers and Thomas Savidge; the name of the other Thomas Beavington. As early as six to o'clock in the morning they were removed, under military escort; from the jail to the new Bridewell, to be executed on the new drop. On their way, the Ludditea very cheerfully sung hymns all the time they passed. Beavington seemed very dejected.— Many thousands of spectators kept assembling until noon to witness this truly tragic scene, and conducted themselves in the most peaceable manner. About twelve o'clock the unhappy men appeared on the platform, attended by the Rev. Mr. Hayton, chaplain to the to the jail; the Rev. Mr. Vaughan, the Sheriff, and other officers. Since their condemnation the Luddites had conducted themselves in the most becoming manner, desiring forgiveness of God, and forgiving Blackburn and Burton, (by far the worse characters) who were admitted evidence against them. Beavington,an ignorant man, was insensible of his situation to the last. Savidge thanked the Reverend Ministers for their kindness and attention on their behalf; he said he had intended to say more, but the time was too far gone, hoped the people would take warning by their fate, fear no man, but fear God; and declared their innocence of shooting.— Amos addressed the people:—" Friends and fellow countrymen! You see here six men going to suffer innocently ; the man who committed the crime will soon be at large. Take warning by our fate— Farewell." Mitchell said a few words, much similar ; and without any apparent agitation they spoke to several friends in the crowd; and threw oranges, &c. to some of them, and desired to be remembered to their Nottingham acquaintances.— When all things were ready for the fatal moment, Amos, with a firm and undaunted voice, said they would now sing a hymn, and desired the people to join them, which was readily complied with by numbers. The hymn he chose, and to which he pitched the tune, was from Dr. Watts.

All the Luddites joined very earnestly in singing the hymn; immediately after which the platform  fell, and launched them into eternity.

Beavington declared his innocence to the last, and *called God to witness* he did not set the stacks on fire.

We lament to say, that the most of these misguided men, in the bloom of life, have left *widows*, and more than *thirty children*, to add to the miseries of the present truly calamitous times !!

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 26 April 1817

The bodies of the unfortunate men executed on Thursday the 17th instant, for the outrage at Loughborough arrived at Nottingham the following morning at three o'clock in two covered carts for interment. Mitchel, Amos, Withers, and Crowder were interred in St. Mary's Church Yard, the former, (Mitchell), at about five o'clock in the morning, the three latter at about five in the afternoon ; and Savidge was interred in the New Burying Ground about the same hour as the latter, amidst great numbers of people. Towle was taken forward to Chilwell, near the place where his friends reside.

Savidge (aged 39) has left a wife and six children; Amos (aged 30) a wife and five children ; Mitchell (aged 29) unmarried ; Withers (aged 33) a wife and one child; these were natives of Nottingham. Towle, (aged 25) a wife had one child a native Chilwell. Crowder (aged 40) a wife and five children, a native of Leicester.

*Lord Middleton's observations on Luddism.* —A Meeting was held at the Moot Hall, Mansfield, on the 9th inst. for the purpose of congratulating the Prince Regent on his escape from the late "violent and treasonable attack against his Royal Person," when several Resolutions and an Address were unanimously adopted.

After the business of the Meeting was over, Lord Middleton spoke at some length on the practices that had so long been the disgrace the county, and after alluding to his own conduct at the late Assizes, (when he withdrew the prosecutions against Mellors and two others, for shooting at his Lordship's Gamekeeper,) said, that the time he was afraid his conduct would be imputed to a wrong motive—that of fear; his Lordship denied that fear operated upon him. That if any future disturbances arose in the county no motive should prevent him from using his utmost endeavours to bring the authors to justice. That he had not spared any pains to learn the real cause of the apparently determined hostility that existed between the employer and the workmen—he had dived into gaols for this purpose. "You may," said his Lordship. "think I possess a hard heart, but I assure you I do not." He said he had been to Leicester, and there he had an interview with one of the unfortunate men who were about to expiate their crimes by an ignominious death. Yes, he had there seen one the unfortunate engines, in the hands of other men, and he believed he had ascertained the cause of the unnatural rancour that had so long existed. He had asked this unfortunate man if it was not possible for something to be done to put an end to the system which had long existed in this county ; he would name this unhappy man, it was Savage, and this was the reply he made:—" My Lord," said he, " if the employer would but fix a price upon the work, that the workman might know what he had to receive, Ludding would have ceased long ago; but the workman never knew what price he was to have. " My Lord," continued this unfortunate man. "I am prepared In die—I do not grieve for myself, but I grieve for my wife, who is now pregnant, and for my six children ; it is for them, my Lord that I grieve, and not for myself for I fear not death." If, continued his Lordship, there are any manufacturers present, I would recommend them to endeavour to conciliate their workmen, and to try to allay that malignant spirit which has for so long a period disturbed the county. His Lordship concluded his speech, which appeared excite considerable interest in the minds of the hearers, by a few other observations relative to the baneful practices that have so long existed in the county, but which, he thought, had now received a death blow.
