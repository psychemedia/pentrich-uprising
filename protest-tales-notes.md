# Protest Tales

Ideally, a 1 hour festival set.

I bring you a story,
Of rebels and spies,

I bring you a tale,
Of Luddites and trials.

Once, there was a kingdom. Its armies had been fighting wars in ar off lands for many years.  It had been blockaded, unable to export the goods that paid for the wars, and hit by several poor harvests in a short few years. The King was troubled in mind and body, and they called him mad. His son, the Prince Regent, extravagant in taste, profligate in nature, a drinker and philanderer, a playboy, acted in his stead. The land was in the midst of a revolution in industry, while most of the working populace were poor, really poor, poverty sricken, destitute, barely able even to afford bread; in the country. The working people often un-represented in a Parliament that created ever more capital crimes — cimes that would see you hung — to suppress dissent. In the country, there was a sense of revolt.

Once, is 1817. The Kingdom, is England. There is a saying amongst storytellers that the story is what's left when the facts are forgotten. The stories I bring you are stories I learned from the newspapers of the time, and the "past times" memorial columns of  a generation, fifty years or so, later. The sort of news stories you might have read, or heard second hand, and perhaps recalled years later. The sort of story that becomes a part of the folk memory.

I originally come from Huddersfield, the setting for two of the stories I will tell you. Whilst I don't remember any particular tale being told of the Luddites of those times, I don't remember "doing" the Luddites at school, or being told family stories about it, somehow, somehow, I have always known about the Luddites. Steeped in the landscape, the soot black stained houses and mills, the ghosts of those times somehow imprinted themselves in me.

So with that, let the stories begin.

It's 1817. Nottingham. N men are tried for High Treason, accused that on the night of ?? they did....

How did it come to this?

Let's go further back. To 1811, Pentrich, Derbyshire, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham.

[Also 15 miles or so orth of Derby, 15 miles or so south of Chesterfield]

Dec 1811 Topham frames broken


Ned Ludd, a mythical character, in whose name these thingsa are done. But Ned Ludd is not any one person. Rather like Jack, the hero of many a traditional tale, Jack, the everyman, Ned Ludd is an every-man of the working people. He may not exist as a person, but jhe exists as an idea. And as local leaders rise up and gather men together to act in his name, in a sense, they become him. They all become him.

March 1816 New Radford - frames owned by Topham,

And so we find ouselves back at Pentrich. Remember Pentrich, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham, where in late 1816 and early 1817, ?? Topham had ?? destroyed? Pentrich.
