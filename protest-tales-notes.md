# Protest Tales

Ideally, a 1 hour festival set.

I bring you a story,
Of rebels and spies,

I bring you a tale,
Of Luddites and trials.

Once, there was a kingdom. Its armies had been fighting wars in ar off lands for many years.  It had been blockaded, unable to export the goods that paid for the wars, and hit by several poor harvests in a short few years. The King was troubled in mind and body, and they called him mad. His son, the Prince Regent, extravagant in taste, profligate in nature, a drinker and philanderer, a playboy, acted in his stead. The land was in the midst of a revolution in industry, while most of the working populace were poor, really poor, poverty stricken, destitute, barely able even to afford bread; in the country, the working people were typically un-represented in a Parliament that created ever more capital crimes — crimes that would see you hung — to suppress dissent. In the country, there was a sense of revolt.

Once, is 1817. The Kingdom, is England. There is a saying amongst storytellers that the story is what's left when the facts are forgotten. The stories I bring you are stories I learned from the newspapers of the time, and the "past times" memorial columns of  a generation, fifty years or so, later. The sort of news stories you might have read, or heard second hand, and perhaps recalled years later. The sort of story that becomes a part of the folk memory.

I originally come from Huddersfield, the setting for two of the stories I will tell you. Whilst I don't remember any particular tale being told of the Luddites of those times, I don't remember "doing" the Luddites at school, or being told family stories about it, somehow, somehow, I have always known about the Luddites. Steeped in the landscape, the soot black stained houses and mills, the ghosts of those times somehow imprinted themselves in me.

So with that, let the stories begin.

It's 1817. Nottingham. N men are tried for High Treason, accused that on the night of ?? they did.... [Pentridge uprsiing]

How did it come to this?

Let's go further back. To 1811, Pentrich, Derbyshire, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham.

[Also 15 miles or so north of Derby, 15 miles or so south of Chesterfield]

Machine breaking starts, march 1811, near Mansfield https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2011/03/ ; then in Arnold.

Burglary https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2011/12/25th-december-1811-burglary-at-south.html

And in New Radford https://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.com/2011/12/1st-december-1811-frame-breaking-at-new.html

Ned Ludd, a mythical character, in whose name these things are done. But Ned Ludd is not any one person. Rather like Jack, the hero of many a traditional tale, Jack, the everyman, Ned Ludd is an every-man of the working people. He may not exist as a person, but jhe exists as an idea. And as local leaders rise up and gather men together to act in his name, in a sense, they become him. They all become him.

March 1816 New Radford - frames owned by Topham,

And so we find ourselves back at Pentrich. Remember Pentrich, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham, where in late 1816 and early 1817, ?? Topham had ?? destroyed? Pentrich.

"Protest Tales", a new set (currently in preparation) that brings together several separate tales of protest and revolt, from the Luddites of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, to the Blanketeers and the Pentrich Rising. One strand that weaves through the performance is place, as we hear different tales from the same locations (e.g. Pentrich, Huddersfield). Another relates to individuals who cross between the tales (a rebel, a newspaperman, a lawyer). A third relates to Special Proceedings and trials, with each of the different trial verdicts representing a moment of jeopardy and providing a regular beat point throughout the set.



Topham - death notice

Nottingham and Newark Mercury - Saturday 11 February 1832

On Thursday week, at Pentridge, of which place he was a native, Mr. Benjamin Topham, aged 67. He some years arm resided in Nottingham, where he was well known. His polities were liberal; yet at the Derbyshire, or Jerry Brandreth *revolution*, in June 1817, all Topham's frames were broken. The disturbances broke out at Pentridge, where Topham was then living. He was an upright, industrious man, but he laid the breaking of his frames so much to heart, that he lost his energy of spirit, and almost sank under it.

[Frames alos broken in December 1811 and march 1812]

London Chronicle - Monday 16 March 1812
NOTTINGHAM RIOTS. The Nottingham Papers state, that the Commission of Assize had been opened in the Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bayley, after complimenting the Magistrates on the smallness of the Calendar, observed, that in the two cases of frame-breaking, " that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital." No outrage had been committed by the frame-breakers within the last few days. The ten frames broken yesterday se'nnight, at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, belonging to Mr. Topham, were in full work. The violence appears to have been owing to personal spleen, as the silk and lace pieces about the frames were much injured, his doors and windows all broken to pieces, and his own life menaced, while the violence was committing, by a number of armed men without. Mr. Topham for a short time concealed himself in a closet.

Statesman (London) - Monday 16 March 1812

N0ttingham  
March 13

The Commission of Assize has just been opened in our Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Gravid Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect :— His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the Calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter

On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame-breaking only, *and no other damage had been done*, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage bad been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the Prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the Prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.

It has been asserted in the House of Commons by Mr. Wynne, and supported by Mr. John Smith, that the Frame-breaking Bill has already had a bad effect, by partly closing up the channels of private Information against the perpetrators. If this is really the case, what good, we would ask, is to be expected from its influence ? for it's terrors have not had the effect of stopping the breaking of frames. If, however, these observations should fall into the hands of the misguided men alluded to, we most earnestly hope that they will take a timely hint, and cease from their destructive and dangerous practices. For, independent of the disquietude such conduct must give to every man's mind, who is concerned in it, on account of the danger of detection, most assured we are that its further prosecution will be attended with the most fatal consequences to the future prosperity of this town and neighbourhood. May our solicitations in this respect not be made is vain !

On Saturday night, seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of Benjamin Topham, of that place; and, what makes the case peculiarly distressing is, the lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*l.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the framebreakers ; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of this town, and two of his own slightly injured ; he having driven them away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence ; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces, about the frames, received considerable injury. What frames were at work, were employed on double press net, and at the full price; therefore, the fair conclusion is, that the violence had its origin in personal spleen ; which, according to his own declaration, as far as his knowledge goes, has been raised against him without any cause whatsoever. The same night two frames were broken at Losco, about four miles on this side Pentridge ; and on Tuesday night, one was carried clean away from Basford.

London Chronicle - Friday 20 March 1812 Topham frames broken

DERBYSHIRE RIOTS.— On Saturday night the 7th inst. seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of B. TOPHAM, of that place; and, what makes the same peculiarly distressing is, these lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*1.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the frame-breakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence ; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace-frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of Nottingham, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven the offenders away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having notice, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers ; and the silk and lace pieces about the frames received considerable injury. On the same night, a man and his wife, at Swanwick, who are expected to be the principle evidences against two persons confined in Derby gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, were visited, as it is supposed, by the same party, who asailed their dwelling broke their furnitute to pieces, and in some degree injured their persons. They have been removed to Derby as a place of safety. The same night two frames were broken at Losca ; and on Tuesday night one was carried away from Basford.

Nottingham Journal - Saturday 14 March 1812
We understand, that not withstanding the pending severities of the law upon the frame-breakers, ten frames were broken and totally demolished, at Pentrich, on Saturday night last ; and on Tuesday night last, the iron work of one narrow stocking frame was stolen and completely carried off from a house, situated on the Parson's Flat, at Basford, near this town.
