The doors and windows the house were made last himself; the street door was lasteued lock, and l,v a bar across the middle. After havm- asleep some time, lie was awakfiud by a noise outside Ins house, and hv bis do- ha.km-: he jumped up, opened his chamber door, and called out, •• who there the prisoner answered “ids Ned.” He knew the . V t!.e prisoaer at once ; is well acquainted whli it, having known him seven years; and lived within hundred yards his house. a-am hollowed out, and the answer was, Ned,” in prisoner voice. The voice fie prisoner, he said, is remarkable. Immediately after the second answer, the street door flew open, upon which witness retired into his bed room, which the first floor, the top ol .he stair,, and adjoins the Workshop. The voice the prisoner m»\v crt!led twice for alight. heard the persons who i.a.l got into the house now enter the frame shop, where they be-an to destroy the frames, while person stood on the stairs, savin— * Ned, do your duty.’ This was not the voiced the prisoner. 'They were about half hour in the shop. From what he l-.ea.d, he thinks the Irauies were broken with hammers or bars. He believes there were seven or eight persons breaking the frames. had eleven frames in his shop. soon they were-one, dressed himself, and called up his next door neighbour, Enibley Dunn, who a Constable, his assistance. went to prisoner’s house, and got there a little afte' - two o’clock in the mornin-. His door was s 1 u . Dunn said would imt enter the house, bad authority. Witness then knocked, and called James Towle,” on which li-l.t was brought. <bi nuni. refusing enter the house, witness sent to Old Basford. for another constable, John Seymour. went with witness, and starched the house. lJ;i-soner was not in. I hey went to Fapplewick, about four mill's olf, in couseijuenee of so.net!.mg they had heard at prisoner’s house, hut prisoner was not there. getting back about six tile inornin-, they went to Bum ford’s, ]>a>foid-!aie, where they found the prisoner, .md apprcliaidd him. When witness examined his workshop, lie found that six frames were broken, and that the needles and star brasses were carried off, together with three and a half pair hose. One of the frames was his own, two belonged to T hns. Deane, one Thomas Burton, one James Hesel- Jiue. and one to John ton, witness’s brother. In his cross-examination, witness said had means of knowing- that prisoner bad frame at Barnford’s, and there. does not know that prisoner’s hail the meas.es, the time the frames were broken. never made any threats as to prisoner. He never in his life said, tiial any time any of his frames were broken, would swear it to prisoner. Never said would prisoner suffer for it. Does not know man of the name Kiliicr; knows Reuben Kilburn, Irishman, who worked for him. Never in his life said, either to Kilim, or to Torr, that would have prisoner taken j up, if any time any of his frames were broken. Never in his said to any person, that would charge prisoner. At the lime Ins were hroxen, live his workmen who slept in the house, were in, namely, T. Tindley, Jos. Fant, Reuben Kilburn, Henrv \Vybey, or some such name, and man named Richard. They did not sleep in one room. One of their bed rooms was next door his bed room, and Ins shop was the other side his bod room. His room was between the shop and theirs. certain it was prisoner’s voice heard. turned his head round to his wife the*lime, and said, ’ that Janies Towle.’ He has known prisoner well for seven years, and never has had any doubt that it was prisoner’s voice heard. Never his life said, would have Towle taken up if any of his frames were ever broken. Re-examined for the prosecution.—Never has had the least doubt of Towle being the man. Prisoner’s wife was living her husband’s house at the time of the depredation. Never had any dispute with Towle his life. John Seymour —Is constable of Old Basfni’d, as sent for at three o’clock on the Monday morning to Gallon’s. People who were about the house, said he was at Towle’s. As witness was coming to Garton’s, saw a light and a man in Bamford s house, ilness spoke to Bamford, and the light was put out. Witness searched prisoner’s hoi s-. Prisoner’s wife and children were home. He then went to a place called Middle Mill to look for Towle, did not find him. He returned between six and seven and apprehended prisoner at Bam ford’s, and took him to Nottingham. Never promised nor threatened prisoner. Prisoner said wanted to speak him. They went into another room, when prisoner asked witness it he had seen the chisel and sword at his house when searched it. Witness said, dill you think I was blind ? Prisoner then told him to lay nothin- about it. going to prisoner’s again that day, he found the chisel, which prodneed in court. The chisel, on being afterwards tried, was found to fit exactly the marks made in forcing open Gartou’s street door. The marks corresponded exactly. Cross-examined. —Witness did not know prisoner worked at Bamford’s, nor did he find any frame in prisoner’s house. Never said to Carton, mav swear to Towle, for he is not at home.’ It was day light when he apprehended prisoner. Found him tying his shoes, if just up. He had seen him open window. Edward Hawke worked with Gallon for about four months previous to the frames being broken, and till that time. Saw Towle on the Saturday before the frames vere broken, at the Three Crowns publichouse, in Parliament-street, Noltin—ham, company vvith many other*. Prisoner asked witness if he worked at Carton's, and if had haled," (reduced their wages.)— Witness said, V cs,” on which prisoner lip?) raided him aboii.Gartoii killing tup mutton, ami /■orclng his men to take it.
