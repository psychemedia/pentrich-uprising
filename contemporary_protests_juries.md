A retired social worker who held up a placard outside a climate trial that read "Jurors you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience" will not face legal action following the High Court ruling in HM Solicitor General v Trudi Ann Warner. The message on the sign referred to the historic Bushel's Case from 1670, which is recognised for establishing jury independence in England and Wales. Ms Warner's placard summarised the principle of "jury equity", the power of a jury to give a verdict according to conscience, and it mirrored wording found on a plaque in the Old Bailey commemorating Bushel's Case. This principle, although well established and affirmed by the highest courts, creates an inherent tension with the obligation of a jury to follow a judge's directions on the law.

By the late 17th century, the court's power to punish juries was removed in Bushel's Case involving a juror on the case against William Penn. Penn and William Mead had been arrested in 1670 for illegally preaching a Quaker sermon and disturbing the peace but four jurors, led by Edward Bushell, refused to find them guilty. Instead of dismissing the jury, the judge sent them back for further deliberations. Despite the judge demanding a guilty verdict, the jury now unanimously found Penn guilty of preaching but acquitted him on the charge of disturbing the peace and acquitted Mead of all charges. The jury was then subsequently kept for three days without "meat, drink, fire and tobacco" to force it to bring in a guilty verdict. When it failed to do so, the judge ended the trial. As punishment, the judge ordered the jurors imprisoned until they paid a fine to the court.[35]


Plaque at the Old Bailey
Four jurors refused to pay the fine, and after several months, Bushell sought a writ of habeas corpus. Chief Justice Vaughan, sitting on the Court of Common Pleas, discharged the writ, released them, called the power to punish a jury "absurd" and forbade judges from punishing jurors for returning a verdict the judge disagreed with.[36] That series of events is considered a significant milestone in the history of jury nullification.[37] The "courage and endurance" of the jury is celebrated in a plaque displayed in the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) in London.
