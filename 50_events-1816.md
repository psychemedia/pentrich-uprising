*Daring Outrage.*—On Saturday night last, about one o'clock, a party of men, disguised and armed with various sorts of weapons, forced the door of Mr. William Wright, of New Radford, when about seven of them, having obtained a light, rushed up stairs into the workshop, or shops, where they demolished twelve point net lace-frames; and with such vengeance did they exercise their lawless authority, that the frames, which were principally of superior worth, are rendered of very little value. It is very singular, that three of these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago, in his shop, at that village, along with a number more, two of which have made very little work, and the other none since they were repaired. One of the other frames belongs to Mrs. Platts of Nottingham, four to Mr. Wright, and three to Mr. Waynman, lace-manufacturer of Nottingham, who is Mr. Wright's principal employer, and one to Mr. Cole, lace-manufacturer. The loss thus occasioned must be very great; but this is not all, for the depredators, not content with the mischief thus done, very materially damaged or destroyed (principally the latter) about thirty-one yards of net which was upon the frames, and took away six yards. The clock face in the house was struck with great violence with a hammer, and the corner cupboard was beat in pieces. Mr. Wright was from home. Mrs. Wright and family were kept in their respective rooms while the mischief was going on, but, as these nightly violators of property and domestic repose had twice to go down stairs for a light, the guarded parties had opportunity of seeing them, and they agree in stating that seven men were in the shop, while Mrs. Wright thinks she saw twelve men that stood watch on the outside. – When the *workmen*, as those, we understand, are called that actually do the mischief, had completed their purpose at Mr. Wright's, they immediately went in the house of Mr. Mullen, close by, the door of which they broke into pieces, and then rushed up into the workshop, where they demolished seven point net lace frames, six of which belonged to Mr. Waynman above named, and one to Mr. Mullen—one was left uninjured, and is generally understood, from the watchword of alarm being given from without. They also took from Mr. Mullen's, fifteen yards of net and a shirt, and left an instrument behind them like a tomahawk ; they also broke the clock. It is proper to state, that the depredators, in order to render their mischief more complete, broke many of the globes, which contain a mixture of water and aquafortis, and which are used by the workmen in winter evenings to add to the brilliancy of their light, and cast the corroding contents upon the frames. — It seems singular, that neither Mr. Mullen nor his wife heard them ; the reason assigned is this, which is a very feasible one, and, from the respectability of Mr. Mullen's character, is universally believed—he had more liquor than he usually takes in an evening, which caused him to sleep very soundly, as he had been in bed about an hour: and Mrs. Mullen, who was also asleep in bed, is very hard of hearing. When these daring offenders had completed the object of their violence, they discharged several pistols — shouted, as though in triumph, and then retired. Two persons are in custody on suspicion.

TH: NOTE "three of the these frames belong to Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, Derbyshire, and were broken about four years ago,"

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE ASSIZES. The business of primary interest at these assizes was the trials of James Croft and James Brawfield, for arson, and *Thomas Chettle* and *Thomas Glover*, for frame-breaking and burglary. The following particulars will convey a general idea of the leading facts, as they came out evidence.

...

John Chettle and Thomas Glover, *for frame-breaking*.— The prisoners were charged with having, on the night of the 8th of June last, at the parish of Radford, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling house of Wm. Wright, and therein broke and destroyed four lace frames, the property of the said Wm. Wright, and eight other frames in the same dwelling-house. They also stood charged with burglariously entering the said dwelling-house, and stealing two pieces of lace; and likewise with having, on the same night, in company with divers other persons, with force and arms, entered the dwelling-house of Thomas Mullen, in the said parish, and maliciously and feloniously broke and destroyed therein one lace frame, belonging to the said Thomas Mullen, and six other frames in the same dwelling-house. To these several counts the prisoners pleaded not guilty.— Wm. Wright and others, in their examination before the Court, gave an account of the breaking of the frames, between twelve and one o'clock the night mentioned in the indictment, by a party of men, in disguise, who made their way into the house, chopping the door with an axe, and forcing it open. The four lace frames were in full employ. Mrs. Waynman stated the extent of the damage sustained, including the lace pieces, at £263. — Ann Wright appeared as principal witness for the prosecution. She said, that she was in bed and was alarmed the noise of some persons chopping the door open: that in her fright she "screeted out murder!" She looked out of the window and saw Chettle and Glover, whom she had known for some time; that she distinctly recognised their features and dress, by the light of the moon, and of a candle which stood in the room. She was quite certain as to their persons. That she heard Chettle say, in his own natural voice, when the men were breaking open the door, " Now you may get in;" and in going through the house, he cautioned the rest, saying to them " mind, you are forgetting your voices." The men were in the house about twenty minutes. On her cross-examination she admitted that she had told different stories about the matter, but that what she had before said was under the influence of fear.—The prisoners, in their defence, set up an *alibi*, which was supported by the testimony of a great number of witnesses. On the part of Chettle it was proved by a woman of the name Wacherley, or Waggerley, who had had children by him, that he was present with her, from 10 o'clock at night on the 8th of June, until two the next morning, in company with several other persons, who had met at a room, in Lamb's buildings, Broad Lane, in that town, to make merry on account of the return of her son, who had been just discharged from the army. J. Ash, —— Price, Frederick Wacherley, Jemima Hunt, Ann Jarvis, and another, who were of the party, corroborated this statement; which was further confirmed by Ann Dry and another, who inhabited adjoining rooms, and had seen the prisoner there at the several hours of one and two in the morning. All the witnesses agreed as to the prisoner being fresh in liquor, and that he had slept on a chair in the room from one to two hours. In addition to this, the wife of a person named Shaw, swore that she saw and spoke to Chettle, at her own door, in Back Lane, about 20 minutes past two in the morning; that he appeared quite fresh, and was going towards home, at New Radford. Witness had been washing and preparing her children's clothes, for them to go to the Sunday School in the morning, and she happened to go to the door at the moment Chettle was coming up the lane. Witness knew Ann Wright; but such was her character, that she would not believe any thing she said upon oath.— On the part of Glover, Mrs Cooper, her servant, and several other persons swore, that he was sitting in the tap-room, at the Odd Fellows' Arms public-house, New Radford, in company with four or five more, who had been partaking of a beef steak with him, from half-past nine or ten o'clock at night of the 8th of June, till two the next morning, and that they never lost sight of him.

The Learned Judge (Graham), in summing up, made some pointed remarks the nature of the evidence brought forward in favour of the prisoners; when the Jury retired, and after consulting together some time, returned a verdict of *not guilty*.

As soon as the Jury had pronounced their verdict, loud shouts of approbation were set up by the crowd assembled in and about the hall.

The trial lasted thirteen hours, and did not terminate until past two o'clock on Sunday morning.— Soon after night-fall, such was the impatience manifested by the crowd for the issue of the trial, that it was with the greatest difficulty that they were restrained from offering personal violence to the members of the Court; and insulting language was several times addressed to the Judge.

On Monday morning the prisoners were again brought up, and after a short hearing, were acquitted on the other two charges.

Wright and others, with having, in company with divers other persons, on the morning the 9th of June, with force and arms entered the dwelling house of the said Wm. Wright, at Radford, and wilfully broken and destroyed 12 lace frames. Upwards of 70 witnesses were examined their trial, which occupied the Court for 13 hours; and in the end the prisoners were acquitted. They were also acquitted upon another indictment for breaking seven frames on the premises of Thomas Mullen, at Radford, and a third indictment for stealing lace upon the premises of Wright.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 30 November 1816

EXECUTION OF J. TOWLE THE LUDDITE

Towle was apprentice to his father, a frame-work-knitter ; and no particular circumstance marked his character, good or bad, until he arrived at manhood ; but since that period, his life has several times been in jeopardy. In the year 1814 he was accused of being one of the band of frame-breakers that destroyed some frames in Mr. Garton's house, in New Basford, the village in which Towle then lived; and at the Lent Assizes following, he was put to the bar, in the County-Hall, in Nottingham, and tried for the offence; but after a long consultation, the Jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. In July, 1816, he was, however, again committed to prison on the charge for which he has now paid the penalty of the law. The offence having been perpetrated at Loughborough, he was of course confined in Leicester gaol, and on Saturday morning, August 10, about seven o'clock, he, along with John Slater and Benjamin Badder, was put to the bar. The trial lasted upwards of twelve hours, and after Baron Graham, who presided, had given his charge, the Jury found Towle *Guilty of aiding and abetting, but not of firing the pistol at Asher*. And, in consequence of the verdict, Baron Graham passed sentence of death upon him.

In the course of the trial, Mr. Denman, one of the counsel for the prisoners, made some objections to the wording of the indictment; and the prisoner was respited, in order that the opinion of the twelve Judges might be taken on the subject.

On the 13th November the case was argued. The Judges being unanimous in their opinion, that the objections could not be sustained, the law was ordered to take its course.
  
On the morning of Wednesday se'nnight, he was taken, under an escort, in a chaise, to the building, an appendage to the New Bridewell now erecting, a short distance from the west end of the Infirmary. At an early hour, great numbers assembled to see the new drop (which had been placed there only the day before) and kept increasing until twelve o'clock, when Towle, with a firm and undaunted step, came upon the platform, attended by the Sheriff and his deputy, the chaplain, the two gaolers, &c. after paying the utmost possible attention to the prayers of the chaplain, with a firm and audible voice, he gave out one of Dr. Watts's admirable hymns, beginning with

> " Oh ! for an overcoming faith,  
> To cheer my dying hours;
> To triumph o'er the monster death,  
> With all his frightful powers."

He gave out the whole of this hymn, two lines at a time, and joined in singing it with the utmost fervency. About half past twelve, every thing being ready, the platform fell, and launched him into eternity, in the presence of an immense number of spectators, who conducted themselves in the most orderly manner, and without the least attempt at disturbance.

After hanging the usual time, his body was demanded by his cousin Josiah Towle, who, before he could obtain it, was required to put his hand to the following document:—

"The corpse of James Towle having been delivered to me on behalf of his mother, who is desirous of interring it at Basford, I hereby undertake that the same shall be buried there before sunset tomorrow, with all possible privacy, and I hereby make myself responsible that there shall be no public exhibition, either previously to, or at the funeral, and particularly that the corpse shall not be detained at the town of Nottingham, but that the same shall be conveyed, as privately as possible, through that town, and in case of any disturbance taking place, in consequence of the conveyance or burial of the said corpse, I consent that this paper may be produced in evidence against me. " JOSIAH TOWLE X his Mark.

" Dated this 20th of Nov. 1816."
  
" I further engage that the corpse shall not be halted or detained at any other place, between Leicester and Basford, than the following:-
  
" To bait one hour at Rothley-House'.
  
" To put up for the night or bait at Costock.
  
"To bait for one hour at Bradmore, and from thence to Basford without stopping."
  
The body was conveyed through Nottingham during the course of Wednesday night, and on Thursday afternoon, was committed to the earth in Basford church-yard, by the side of his father, in the presence of thousands of spectators ;-every thing being conducted in the most peaceable and orderly manner.

James Towle was about five feet two inches high, 34 years of age, and has left a wife and four children to lament his untimely end. During the whole of his confinement, he conducted himself with great propriety, but elicited nothing that would at all implicate the *Luddites*, in whose dark and diabolical system he has been the first to suffer. His wife and four children, with some relatives, arrived on Sunday, and continued until Tuesday. The following letter, addressed to his wife, written after her departure, and late on the night previous to his execution, will best exemplify the tranquil state his mind was brought to from an attention to religious exercises since his condemnation:—

" Dear Wife— In a few more hours I shall be no more. But my dear creature, in my last moments it is my duty to beg of you to seek for that peace in God which is far beyond my pen to describe or tongue to speak; and my dear girl, above all, I hope you will bring my dear children up in the fear and love of God, and then you will find a friend-a friend that will support you through all the troubles of this world, and in the hour of death give you that comfort that will raise your mind far above all the treasures that the earth can afford. My dear girl, this afternoon there has been a gentleman that wished to see me, and promised me that he would do a something for you towards making you comfortable, and my dear, I have no doubt but my mother will be agreeable for you and my dear children to be with her, and I hope and trust she will be a mother and is guardian to my sweet babes, which in so short a time will be fatherless. Dear wife, my last words are, may God Almighty bless and protect you and my dear children in this world, and prepare you for the world to come, is my sincere prayer.

"From your dying husband

"James Towle.

"Tuesday night, ten o'clock"

Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 02 February 1839

Death of an alleged Luddite.

On Friday, Mr. Thos. Glover, lacemaker, died at Nottingham, aged 54. His death was very sudden ; he fell down in a fit, when at work, and an inquest was held upon his body. The deceased was well known, in consequence of being tried, along with John Chettle, before Baron Graham, in the county hall at Nottingham, on Saturday the 3rd of August, 1816, charged with breaking the lace machines of Mr. Mullen and Mr. Wright, at New Radford. That memorable trial commenced on Saturday afternoon, and did not terminate until after two o'clock on Sunday morning. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Reader were counsel for the prosecution ; the present Lord Chief Justice, then Mr. Denman, was the sole counsel for the prisoners, and added to his well-earned reputation by the ability with which he conducted and established the *alibi* set up, unquestionably the moat complete of any it was ever our lot to witness in a court of justice. Fortunately for the public peace, the result of the trial was the acquittal of both prisoners. Had it been otherwise, the most fearful consequences would doubtless have ensued, for the body of the hall was for hours in possession of a number of men, who would not suffer a light to appear in court, excepting on the bench and the counsel table. It is notorious that armed men were in the outer hall, and the constables and javelin-men were quite unable to maintain order. Never shall we forget the shout with which the verdict of Not Guilty was received, and the unavailing attempts of the Judge to silence it. Since that period, Glover has sustained many vicissitudes of fortune, but latterly he has been much reduced in consequence of the great depreciation in the value of lace machinery. John Chettle, his fellow prisoner, died on the 15th of July last.— *Nottingham Review*.

Aris's Birmingham Gazette - Monday 30 December 1816

It is with the greatest concern we feel it our duty, this week, to record one of the most atrocious attempts at murder that has ever disgraced this county :—On Sunday evening last, about a quarter before eight o'clock, as George Kerry and his family (who reside at a lone house, by the road leading from Bobbers mill to Bilborough) were sitting by the fire, at supper, their house was entered by two men in disguise. Kerry, in attempting to seize the foremost man, was shot at by him, but without effect ; during the struggle the other man fired, but fortunately the slugs only grazed his head. The murderers thinking their object attained, instantly departed. The most prompt assistance was rendered by the neighbours, and the police from Nottingham; but owing to the frost and the extreme darkness of the night, no trace whatever could be discovered of their retreat. On further enquiry, we learn, that a third person was standing at the door during the transaction, and the prevailing opinion is, that the party were *Luddites*, and that they came from New Radford. *Nottingham Journal*
