# And So It Begins

They were strange times. The King was mad, and though the throne was still his, but his son, the Prince, the prince Regent, ruled in his place.

And the Prince Regent: oh, the stories that could be told about him: a playboy, an adulterer, over-sexed and over-watered, he could spend money faster than any Parliament could ever grant it him.

And the country: things could have been better, for the country had been at war for years in foreign lands; but now things were biting hard at home too, as economic warfare played out.
