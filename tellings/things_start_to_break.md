# And So It Begins

They were strange times, strange times indeed. The King was generally agreed to be mad, so mad, in fact, that everyone one agreed he wasn't really fit to rule. But he was the King, and so they couldn't just *get rid of him*. But they could get someone else, and in particular. his son, the Prince, the Prince Regent, to rule on his behalf.

But if the King was *mad*, you could equally say the that Prince was *bad*, and from quite an early age too. Cos he was a playboy, an adulterer; over-sexed and over-watered; he could spend money faster than any Parliament could grant it to him, and he knew how to party. You might even say that was all he knew how to do.


You couldn't really say much of positive note about the state of country, either: because things could have been better. Far better. The foreign war had been going on for years, and now things were hitting hard at home too. For a while, the war had been a Good Thing for the manufacturers: lots of soldiers meant they needed lots of uniforms, and with a wide open export market, the profits were good and there was more than enough work for everyone. But when the blockades began and the exports stopped, there was too much production, and the prices collapsed.

For the stocking-makers servicing the top-end of the market, they perhaps hadn't been too concerned in the earlier Good Times by the masters taking on too many colts, the unskilled workers who hadn't served their seven years of apprenticeship. Nor by the wide frames that were used to make cut-ups - poor quality stockings that were sewn together and sold cheaply. But the fashion had changed, the exports had stopped, and the prices had collapsed. And for the master stocking-makers, the skilled and professional workers who took a pride in their work, well, the cheap tat produced by the unskilled colts was now taking their business, and forcing down the prices that were paid for their work.

And they weren't happy.

They tried to argue their case; they even went so far as holding the jack-wires you needed to work the frames to ransom, hiding them in the sanctueary of local churches thereabouts, and for a while, an accommodation was made. But then some of the hosiers started reducing the prices again, hiring the colts, paying master stockingers in truck — giving them credit rather coin and forcing them to buy goods from the hosier's shop at ridiculous prices. 

I couldn't tell you why they had it in for Benjamin Topham, who, at not quite fifty years of age, made his business round Pentridge way, but they surely seemd to have it in for him, one way or another.

That first night, early in December it was, soon after midnight, when they came round to his house, and knocked at his door, they pointed three guns at him, demanded the key to his workshop — "we'll blow yer brains out if yer don't" — and a light to see by. But he claimed not to have the wide frames, not to be doing the cut-up work, he was a good man, and honourable man, and they left him cursing their bad intelligence. And paid a visit to several other shops in the village. And they made it known that they be back to demolish any frames that were used at an under price, or worked by Colts.

And so they came back the following night, but the prices had been raised, so they went away again, save for breaking a couple of frames from shops in villages roundabout there that deserved it.

But then, a few days later, they were back again, and took ouit several frames, including two of Topham's, who by all accounts still claimed he were paying top-price. But this time he wasn't there when they called round, he was just coming back from doing business Nottigham, fifteen miles or so away. But he heard what was going on, and, oh you should have seen, him, he rushed to the vicarage, and banged on the door and "give me the the key to the Church, give me the key to the Church" — managed to start ringing the bells and raising the alarm.

And that scared off the frame-breakers from there at least, though it didn't stop their night's work. Cos they broke a few more frames roundabout that night, as they had other nights too.

They called out the Cavalry of course, and the Yeomanry, but they weren't much good. The frame-breakers were way too clever for them, even then. And if there was one Ned Ludd leading them, there were many, or none. And they knew where they were going, they knew all the paths and the byways, and by night as well as they did by day. And Christmas came and went.

And as the first weeks of the new year went by, eighteen hundred and twleve as it now was, the frames continued to be broken. And for the same reason. Cheap unskilled labour, wide frame produced tat, and hosiers who were following the prices down to try and preseve what business they could at the expense of the manufacturers.

In the Parliament of the mad King, and the playboy Prince Regent, a bill was introduced to make frame-breaking in those parts punishable by death. And as Parliament debated, the frames continued to be broken.

Whether or not Topham had deserved to have his frames broken, word had it that he wanted something done about those frame-breakers, those Luddites as they were calling themselves.

So even as the frames were being broken for just cause — at least as they Luddites would argue it — maybe that's why they went after Topham again, even as he was urging the magistrates to go after them.

And so it was that in the few days before the Frame-Breaking Act received Royal Assent from the Prince Regent, Topham received a third visit from the frame-breakers. He knew he wouldn't be able to talk them round this time, so he placed a premium on his own personal safety and hid in a cupboard, while outside  he heard his life threatened by the many voices of the men who would broke ten more of his frames, and the doors and windows of his house and shop too, for in those days your house was your shop.

Now as I've heard it told that he *was* paying full-price for the work on those frames, and that this was some sort of vengeful attack; but that's not to say there weren't those who deserved to have their machines broken, nor whether there was some other reason he'd attracted the ire of the frame-breakers. Cos history doesn't say so much about those other men who were targeted. Maybe Topham was the exception, which is why the press chose to mention him rather than the ones they couldn't defend.
