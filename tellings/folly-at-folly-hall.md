Folly Hall - https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/Folly_Hall,_Huddersfield
According to local historian Philip Ahier in The Legends and Traditions of Huddersfield and Its District, there were two theories to explain the nickname:
the location was prone to flooding, so it was a folly to build anything there
it was a folly to build anything so far from the centre of Huddersfield
Ahier also noted that locals referred to the building as "The Cottage by the Sea".

Discovering Old Huddersfield (1993-2002) by Gordon & Enid Minter:
Folly Hall, the area at the end of Colne Road and the bottom of Chapel Hill, owes its name to the enterprise of one Marmaduke Hebden, a man of property in Huddersfield in the eighteenth century. Duke Hebden was the only Huddersfield man to invest in the new Huddersfield to Woodhead turnpike of 1768. Confident that the new road would extend development southwards from the town centre, Hebden commissioned Blind Jack Metcalf to build a row of four tenements near to the bridge over the river. Most people, however, considered it unwise to build so far from the centre of things and soon, probably even before it was finished, Hebden's building was being referred to as "Folly Hall". The building, which became the Commercial Inn, stood for one hundred and fifteen years before it was demolished in 1890.

Folly Ha11 is associated with the famous " Folly Hall Fight! " which took place on June 9, 1817. There are two entirely different versions of this "skirmish" which "took place at a time of great agitation " and unrest among the people of Haddersfield. The first Was given by Mr. John Hanson in the article previously quoted `[John Hansen, of the Lead Works, Folly Hall, in an article entitled "Huddersfield Twenty Years Ago," written for the defunct " Huddersfield Chronicle" or "The Huddersfield Weekly News " (June 1, 1878)]`:   

" This (an open field opposite a former primitive foundry) was the scene of the first famous Folly Hall Fight, where General Croft gave those notable words of command, ' Front rank, kneel,down, rear rank, fire,' which struck terror in the hearts of our brave yeomanry cavalry."

" This 'Folly Hall Fight', as it was called, took place at a time of great agitation. In many places, the people were drilling and arming to fight for their rights and liberties. Croft was a brave old soldier who had fought in many a battle. He was drilling a squad of 'rebels' in the field by the River. The Yeomanry had been apprised of this and came down valiantly to disperse the ' rebels.' When they (the Yeomanry) reached the bridge they made a stand to reconnoitre. Just at that moment, the old veteran, in the course of his drill insruetions, bawled out at the top of his voice, the the *(sic)* terrible words, 'Front rank, kneel down! rear rank, fire.' A few pistols went off,  hereupon our valiant Bobadils took alarm, turned their horses sharp round and galloped up Chapel Hill as if they were riding a steeplechase. They ventured not to check their flight until they ran back to cover in the back yard of "The
Rose and Crown." (p. 228). Some sadly malicious people even said they wounded a horse in the nose with a pistol shot, to show what dangers they had braved, and the terrible jeopardy in which their valuable lives had been placed. In all probability, the malicious people who said so were not far wide of the mark. Thus ended the Folly Hall fight, where the vanquished fled without being attacked or even threatened) and the victors were wholly unaware of the brilliant repulse they had effected."

The second version of the " Folly Hall Fight" is given by Mr. James Mayhall in his " Annals of Yorkshire " (Vol. 1., p. 263) under the year 1817 :—

" On the 9th of June, some hundreds of persons assembled about midnight, at a place adjoining the town of Hudders?eld,
called Folly Hall Bridge, under a delusive expectation that they would be joined by other insurgents from various parts of the kingdom, and that, when united, their force would be sufficiently strong to overturn the government of the country ! The approach of half a dozen yemmmry cavalry produced considerable alarm amongst them; but they mustered military ardour sufficient to fire several shots, and one of the cavalry horses was wounded in the head. The yeomzmry, not considering it prudent to engage with so great a disparity of numbers, retreated for the purpose of obtaining a reinforcement, but before they could return to the field, a panic had seized the motley assembly at the bridge, and
in a few minutes, their force was completely dispersed."

" Four and twenty persons, charged with having in some way participated in this futile enterprise, were subsequently apprehended and committed to York Castle, and several others escaped. At the Assizes, in July, ten of the prisoners were put upon their trial before Baron Wood; part of them charged with stealing firearms on their way to the place of the rendezvous, and the remainder with aiding and abetting certain persons unknown, in firing at, with an intent to kill, maim, or disable Mr. David Alexander, the yeomanry cavalryman whose horse was shot in the head. Both the charges being ill—supported by evidence, all the prisoners put upon their trial were acquitted."

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Wednesday 30 July 1817


SUMMER ASSIZES. YORK, Saturday, July 26. CROWN SIDE.

B. Lockwood, of Salford, in Lockwood, in the West Riding of this county, cloth dresser; G.  Waffenden, of the some place, cloth dresser ; J. Wilson, of the same place and profession ; and J. Jysop, of the same place add profession, were indicted for a captial offence, in aiding and abetting a tumultuous assembly, one of whom fired at D. Alexander, on the night of the Bth of June last, at Folly-hall-bridge. near Huddersheld, with the intent of murdering the said D. Alexander.

Capt. Armitage deposed, that he commanded the yeomanry cavalry of the district of Huddersfield ; was called on the night of Sunday the 9th June, upon information that a tumultuary assemblage had collected at Folly-hall, or Engine-bridge, near Huddersfield. He proceeded with six patrole and the constable Whitehead, Witness saw an assemblage of men on the bridge; but from the darkness of the night he could not perceive whether they had arms not. He called out to the constable, to speak to them. The constable obeyed the summons ; and as soon as he had come up witness observed fire flash in the pair of one of the guns or pistols borne by the rioters. He was certain that the flash proceeded from the party on the bridge. Instantaneously a gun was fired from the same party; and soon afterwards several others. All the shots might about 20. Witness remained till about 10 shots were fired. He saw a moving body beyond the centre of the bridge; and concluding that the intervening space was occupied by the party, and that subsequently their numbers were considerable, and considering that his party only consisted of six to oppose them, he thought it prudent to retreat to Huddersfield for an increase of force. He accordingly did so ; and returning afterwards, when he had gained an accession of numbers, found that the rioters were dispersed.

G. Whitehead, a constable at Huddersfield, who accompanied the patrole, confirmed the testimony of the preceding witness.

D. Alexander, one the yeomanry caValry of Huddersfield, was on duty on the 8th of June. He was a little in  advance; he halted at the end of bridge, where he saw men ; they appeared to amount to 60 or 70. Before the constable spoke, the mob called out "Who comes there?" Immediately a gun flashed in the pan, another piece was fired, and soon after several more. At the third shot his horse staggered ; the party retreated after several other shots were fired. About an hour afterwards he examined his horse’s head, and took out of it a pistol ball.

G. Armitage stated, that on the night of the 8th June he was at Lockwood, a short distance from Huddersfield, with C. Bamshaw. Two persons with guns stopped them, and said they must go along with them to a field close to Engine-bridge, as it had been resolved to try how many could be mustered. He saw none of the prisoners in the field except Wilson. They received orders to advance to the bridge. Two men with scythes, stretched out, stood on the crown of the bridge, and prevented any one from passing. At the bridge he saw Lockwood and Woffenden, who had guns. He saw Jysop there also with a scythe.— Croft appeared to have the command, and directed who had arms to arrange themselves on each side of the road, while those who had not stood in the middle. He then ordered those with arms to kneel. Heard the trampling of the horses feet when the cavalry were advancing; and then Croft calls out, three times, " Who comes there ?" He did not hear what answer was made; but Croft ordered those who had arms to fire.

The prisoners said nothing in their defence; but severa] witnesses were called in their behalf, who gave them good characters. The Jury retired about 10 minutes; and on their return, found all the prisoners— Not Guilty.
