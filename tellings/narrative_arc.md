# Possible natrative arcs

Been pondering  the set of 1812-17, protest tales I want to tell as a narrative arc, and one line just occurred to me now that i think lets me start in June 1817 with Edward Baines, Editor of the Leeds Mercury reporting on an insurrection on Huddersfield. From that we get a spy, a series of failed trials, and one more trial to come, of some rebels caught at Pentrich on the same day as the Hudds rebels, trapped by the same spy. At this point, loop back to Hudds 1812, Luddites, and hanging. The role of the Mercury in that. Luddite origins in 1811, reports of which fuelled Hudds Luddites, then a broken narrative of Notts Luddism, with a final Luddite trial in March 1817. Just before where we started. So what happened to the Pentrich men we left about to go on trial.. One story is the editor/investigative journalist tale, one arises from one person's response to news, one character is gang mentality, and character sketches in that, last story could be an individual tale of eg Turner or Brandreth, or could be the Attorney General, or State, state wanting a kill. Which would admittedly be a bit of a downer to end on!
