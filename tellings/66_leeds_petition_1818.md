THE LEEDS PLOT.

*(From the Leeds Mercury.)*

While the country was smoothing itself with the hope that the conspiracies against the State, of which they had heard so much, and seen so little, were all at an end; and while even the Argus-eyed vigilance of his Majesty's Ministers slept; a most awful discovery of a plot in which two thousand conspirators are engaged has been made in Leeds! It seems "that one hundred petitions, signed by twenty persons each praying for Reform, were presented ot the House of Commons, in the beginning of this month, from the town of Leeds; and so profound was the secrecy with which these Petitions were got up, that the Printer of the *Leeds Intelligencer*, whose sagacity is almost equal to his moderation, "has not been able to learn that any one person, except the alleged Petitioners themselves, knew these Petitions were in Progress in the town, or had heard of them until they were presented to the House." The conspiring mind implied in the obtaining of these two thousand signatures, without the knowledge of a soul but the alleged Petitioners, is announced as one of the most alarming facts that has occurred in the whole progress of the existing disaffection— and the persons engaged in the plot, are denounced as "a band of close conspiring villains." To add to the horrors of this discovery, the Printer of the *Intelligencer* has heard, but he does not know how truly, that delegates have lately been sent from Huddersfield to London, for the purpose of renewing the machinations of last year; and, in conclusion, it is intimated, that it is necessary again to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, to prevent the congregating of another "concourse of these scoundrels in the Metropolis." The *Courier*, who is a fellow labourer in the vocation of alarm creating, has copied part of the *Intelligencer's news*; but the terms villains and scoundrels were too gross even for the columns of that Paper, and the Editor has very properly omitted such outrageous epithets.

We believe that there are very few persons upon whom this political hoax is calculated to impose, but it may notwithstanding, be necessary in order to calm the tremulous nerves of those who are prone to be alarmed by phantoms, to say, that so far from any secresy prevailing on the subject of the Petitions a letter from Major Cartwright, recommending petitioning by twenties, was inserted in is this paper before the petitions were set on foot— that many of the signatures were obtained upon a table, placed for successive market-days near the Market Cross *(within about two hundred yards of the Leeds Intelligencer Office)* —and that, so far from a knowledge of the Petitions being confined to two thousand persons though that is a pretty round number, ten thousand of the inhabitants at least were in the secret. The history of the transaction we find on enquiry, to be this:— a numbe of men, principally, if not altogether in the labouring classes, thinking it proper to renew their Petitions for Annual Parliaments and Universal Suffrage, handed about each a sheet of paper, with a short form of Petition inscribed upon the head of it; and we believe there are very few workshops or manufactories in the town, in which the petitions were not openly displayed as they were upon the tables in the open the public market.
