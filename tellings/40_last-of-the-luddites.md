A couple of luddites acquitted at Nottingham assizes, but protest and abuse at judge. In leicester, citizens turned out and presented with sticks to protect judge; towle et al. et al were let off but towle sentenced to death (shooting of one of people attacked); anecdotes on towle disclosures to policemen sealed his fate.
