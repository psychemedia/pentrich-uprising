Leeds Mercury - Saturday 14 June 1817</p>
<p>TRIALS FOR TREASON.</p>
<p>FIRST DAY.— MONDAY, JUNE 9.</p>
<p>This day was fixed for the Trials of the State Prisoners confined in the Tower.</p>
<p>Last night the Guards were doubled at the Tower, and this morning orders were issued to prevent all strangers from entering the interior of the place. In consequence of this, the Yeomen of the Guard who were posted at the gate of the entrance leading to the bloody Tower, prevented all strangers from going that way.</p>
<p>At about 20 minutes after eight o’clock, Watson, Hooper, Preston, and Thistlewood, were brought from the Tower to Westminster Hall, in four glass coaches. In each coach were four Yeomen of the Guard, and one prisoner; and the whole procession was escorted by two troops of Life Guards. They passed over London Bridge. When they arrived in Palace-yard, the prisoners got out of their respective coaches, in the order in which we have mentioned their names, and were conducted, each between two Yeomen of the Guard, through a lane of Constables, to the wicket at the great entrance into the Hall.</p>
<p>On the gates of the Hall being opened, at a quarter after eight, it was discovered that a large and strong railing had been thrown across the hall from the Treasury steps, to prevent the pressure of the crowd and the interruption of the Law Officers in their passage to the Court.</p>
<p>At half-past eight o’clock, there was a tremendous crush at the doors of the Court, which was immediately followed by a grand entry of Barristers, who took their seats at the back part, reserving two clear benches for the Counsel on the part of the Crown and the prisoners.</p>
<p>At 20 minutes to nine o’clock, Mr. Watson was ushered into Court by a party of Yeomen of the Guard. He was dressed in a suit of black, and carried under his right arm a book; he bowed respectfully to the Court, and took his seat immediately behind the bar.</p>
<p>The Captain of the Yeomen or Gentleman Jailor, and the Lieutenant of the Tower, took their seats to the left of Watson. Preston was next ushered into Court, attended by another party of Yeomen of the Guard, he was also dressed in black; he appeared cheerful, and cordially shook hands with Watson: a party of Yeomen also escorted him. Hooper next made his appearance, and was dressed in black; he also shook hands with Watson and the rest. Thistlewood came in last; he looked ill: was dressed in a sailor’s jacket and trowsers, and wore a black handkerchief. He manifested great anxiety to speak to Watson, and on his approach to him shook him heartily by the hand.—Sixteen Yeomen of the Guard sat by the side and behind the prisoners.</p>
<p>Before the proceedings commenced, the prisoners frequently conversed together. The Attorney-General elected to try the prisoners separately, and to take the case of Watson first.</p>
<p>A great number of Jurors were challenged both by the Counsel for the Crown, and also by the Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
<p>The following Gentlemen were then sworn of the Jury.</p>
<p>Thomas Allmack, Conduit street, bookseller.<br />
Robert Nocton, Temple-bar, button-maker.<br />
John Tomlinson, Covent.Garden, woollen-draper.<br />
P. Richardson. Charing-Cross, Lottery-office Keeper<br />
John Briant, Wapping-street, Anchor-smith.<br />
Samuel Kell. Red-Lion street, Holborn, carpenter.<br />
Richard Ramsden, Holborn, Capilaire-maker.<br />
William Phillips, Holborn, iron-monger.<br />
T. W. Barker, Hatton-garden, silversmith.<br />
Richard Perkins, Holborn, shoe-maker.<br />
William Hatblock, Shoreditch, currier.<br />
Samuel Knight, Norton-Falgate, druggist.</p>
<p>Proclamation was made in the usual way, as soon as the Jury was sworn, and then Mr. Barlow, the Officer of the Court, proceeded to read the Indictment Bill. After the-first count thereof was read,</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough interposed and observed, that as all the other counts had annexed to them the same series of Overt Acts, he supposed that it would not be required by either party to have the whole of these repeatedly read over.</p>
<p>Mr. Wetherell, on the part of the prisoners, said, it could not be the wish of the Gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Copley) to cause the least unnecessary trouble or delay, but on the contrary their wish was to prevent both. The officer of the Court then by the consent of all sides, only recited the general counts, four in number, of the indictment, without repeating the overt acts.</p>
<p>Mr. Shepherd, the junior Counsel for the prosecution, then opened the pleadings; but signified, that after the time that was occupied in reading over the particulars of the charge, he would refrain from repeating it.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General then rose, and in a very long speech set forth the charges against the prisoners.- After he had concluded his speech on Monday, and evidence had been gone into, the Court ordered no part of the proceedings to be published during the trial.</p>
<p>SECOND DAY.</p>
<p>The prisoners were brought into Court with the same ceremony and solemnity as yesterday, and the Judges took their seats on the Bench precisely at nine o’clock. The first witness called, was</p>
<p><em>Charles Shearman, Jun.</em> who was examined by the Solicitor-General. He deposed to the events in Spa-Fields, to the flag placed in the waggon, and to the speeches from that vehicle. On his cross-examination, he said, that he was twelve yards from the waggon, and heard no other part of the speech of a young man, but his invitation to jump down. To a question from the Court, he said, that only one person spoke while he was in the field, and he could not tell whether more than one individual jumped down, general as might be the invitation.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Johne Stafford</em>, chief clerk at Bow-street, said, that on the 2d of December there was a great concourse of people at Spa-Fields; Mr. Hunt and others addressed the populace. He saw a flag displayed of three colours; green, white, and red. Inscribed upon it was, Nature, Justice, Truth, and some other words. A great many Police Officers were in attendance.</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough observed, that it might be as well here to produce the flag itself, and the flag was accordingly exhibited by Mr. Hobler, Clerk of the Mayor’s Court.</p>
<p>The witness resumed, after some further trifling particulars, that he saw all the people in the waggon in the act of jumping down. He endeavoured to break the pole to which one of the flags was attached, but was unable to do so; yet, he got the flag under his feet, when Limerick, the officer, assisted him. On his cross-examination, he deposed that all the assistants of the police officers were in attendance. He saw no soldiers in the field, nor did he know that any soldiers were in the vicinity.</p>
<p><em>Limerick</em> was next examined to nearly the same particulars.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Platt</em> proved the discharging a pistol at him in Mr. Beckwith’s shop, under the circumstances already before the public, and during his examination it was attempted to be shown that the pistol went off while the witness was wrestling with the person by whom was supposed to be discharged.</p>
<p><em>Sir J. Shaw</em> spoke to the seizure of the colours, &amp;c. at the Royal Exchange. He thought it a very contemptible riot, which might easily have been suppressed.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Hall</em>, the High Sheriff of the county of Middlesex, detailed what had occurred in the Minories. He only saw about 19 men with arms, and they were rather wantonly than viciously using them. He thought that about 20 soldiers might have put an end to the whole disturbance. He applied to the Tower for assistance, but in vain.</p>
<p>Several other witnesses spoke to the same effect. Some important papers taken upon the person of Watson, were rejected from the want of proper identification.</p>
<p>THIRD DAY.</p>
<p>This morning, the State prisoners arrived at Westminster at about a quarter past eight, and having been brought into Court, Watson was placed as usual in the front, and the others immediately behind him; they shook hands together, and appeared to be provided with refreshments, and were in high spirits; they were attended by sixteen Yeomen of the Guard. At half past eight, Mr. Justice Bailey took his seat on the Bench, for the purpose of disposing of several common motions, and at nine o’clock the Chief Justice and the other Judges entered the Court. At the same time the Attorney-General, Mr. Topping, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Richardson, and Mr. Shepherd, for the prosecution, came in; and when Mr. Wetherell, and Mr. Serjeant Copley, had taken their seats, the trial proceeded.</p>
<p><em>Charles Mills</em>, of Terne’s-court, Somers-Town, a patrole of Bow-street, was examined by the Solicitor General.</p>
<p><em>John Castle</em> was afterwards examined, and his examination occupied the whole of the day.</p>
<p>At seven o’clock Lord Ellenborough asked the Counsel for the prisoners, whether they meant to proceed in the cross-examination, as the examination in chief was finished.</p>
<p>Mr. Wetherell said he was impressed with the necessity of asking the witness a few questions, at the same time that he felt the fatigue under which the Court and Jury must suffer, if he proceeded at length into the cross-examination of the witness. After so long examination as had already taken place, it could not be supposed that his examination of Castle could be short, he would proceed to the usual hour at which the Court adjourned, and resume in the morning.</p>
<p>The Attorney General objected to any suspension of the cross-examination. It was open to the Counsel for the prisoner either to proceed now or to-morrow.</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough said, that the Court were prepared to hear him go on; but at the same time they were ready to accommodate the Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
<p>Mr. Wetherell submitted to the Court, that in a case so infinitely important they would direct that the witness Castle, who appeared, on the return of the list of witnesses to be in custody, should not be permitted to have communication directly or indirectly, with any person, previous to his cross-examination.</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough did not see how the Court, with regard to precedent, could make such an order; but he thought Mr. Wetherell could best rely on the assurance of the Attorney-General.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said, he was sure the Court would agree with him in thinking, that Mr Wetherell had asked no more than was right; and after hearing their Lordships’ opinion, he felt it his duty to give a positive order, that the witness, Castle, shall not on any pretence have any communication whatever on the subject of the trial, till after his cross-examination.</p>
<p>After this, it was settled that the cross-examination should take place at the opening of the Court to morrow, and Mr. Wetherell said, he was afraid it would occupy a considerable time.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, while Mr. Gurney was examining Castle, Mr. Stafford brought into Court a considerable number of pieces of paper, with the following and various other inscriptions on them, “<em>Britons arise! No poverty in a plentiful Country.
!</em>” which he stated were circulating in great numbers throughout the Hall. They were immediately handed to the Attorney-General, who rose and addressed the Court immediately: “He should at all times be extremely sorry to interrupt the proceedings of the Court, but more particularly upon an important occasion, like the present; but seeing the Sheriff in Court, he hoped that Gentleman would excuse the liberty he took in suggesting that more than ordinary caution ought to be exerted in the Hall, to prevent the infraction of the public peace, when papers of the very dangerous tendency of those produced were in circulation.</p>
<p>On the swearing of the officers to keep the Jury from any communication, one of them observed, that if detained in the Court all day, and in seclusion all the evening, he feared the proceedings would be still further deferred by some of them being at length obliged to require medical assistance.</p>
<p>The Court felt their situation, and would endeavour to afford every convenience compatible with duty. It was better not to say more in Court. The officer attendant on the Jury was ordered to attend their Lordships in their Chamber.</p>
<p>The Sheriff now quitted the Court, and the proceedings of the day finished without any interruption.</p>
<p>The Tower yesterday received an additional reinforcement of 200 men from the brigade of guards. The whole are placed under the command of Lieut. Col. Cochrane,of the 3d guards.</p>
<p>The prisoners, on their return from the Court, the moment they entered the Hall, were received with loud huzzas from the surrounding multitude, which were repeated in Palace-yard, and continued to Westminster-bridge.</p>
<p>FOURTH DAY.</p>
<p>After Mr. Justice Holroyd had disposed of a great many common motions, the other Judges took their seats on the Bench, and at half-past nine Mr. Wetherell commenced his cross-examination of Cassels who was brought up in custody. His first interrogatories to this witness were to ascertain whether he had had any communication with any person, or person’s, directly or indirectly, by writing, printing, or otherwise, upon the subject of his testimony yesterday: all of which interrogatories he answered in the negative.</p>
<p>The orders for the exclusion of strangers at the Tower during the time that the State Prisoners are there, continue to be enforced, and no person who is not well known is permitted to enter the interior of the garrison.</p>
<p>Several Members of Parliament, Sir Robert Wilson, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Hunt, &amp;c. were in Court.</p>
<p>Every thing remained in perfect quietness in and about the Hall, and this day’s proceedings finished at six o’clock. The prisoners were cheered on going back to the Tower.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 June 1817</p>
<p>WATSON’S TRIAL CONTINUED.</p>
<p>On Thursday, at half-past nine, the trial again re-commenced with the cross-examination of Castle, who was brought up in custody; the cross-examination continued till one o’clock, after which a number of witnesses were produced to speak to various circumstances;  this occupied the Court till half-past six, when the prisoners were again re-conveyed to the Tower.</p>
<p>On Friday, the examination of witnesses for the Crown was resumed, which continued till half-past twelve, when the Attorney-General declared he had closed his case.— Mr. Wetherell then commenced stating the prisoner’s case, and did not terminate his address, until six o’clock in the evening. The Learned Counsel’s speech was full of legal argument, and displayed the strongest powers of reasoning. He contended that, if the case of the prisoner were made out, it came within the provisions of the law for tumultuary riots, and not within the statutes of treason. It was impossible, he said, to bring it within the latter, without breaking down those great boundaries which marked out the distinctive classification of criminal offence. He also took an historical review of the different riots which took place for the last century, the tumults in the reign of Queen Anne and George I. Lord George Gordon’s riots in 1780, and others, down to the late period of the Corn Bill and said, that, if the law of treason could have been at all applied, the Attorney-Generals of these times would lave called it into operation. At great length he combated the principle of constructive and interpretative treason. —At six o’clock the evidence for the prisoner was about to be entered into, which the Court adjourned.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mr. Wetherell proceeded to call witnesses upon the first head of the defence, namely, the incredibility of John Castle’s evidence. Mr. Hunt, the Spa-Fields orator, and Mr. Bryant, a solicitor, were examined on this head. Evidence was then tendered to shew Castle had been guilty of crimes of which he had never been convicted, but the Judges decided it could not be received.— At one o’clock Mr. Wetherell finished the evidence for the prisoner, and after their Lordships had taken some coffee, and Mr. Serjeant Copley had taken some necessary refreshment, he rose and addressed the Jury on the evidence on both sides. At the close of his speech, the prisoner declining to offer any thing to the Court himself, the Solicitor-General was occupied several hours in replying on behalf of the Crown, and the Court then adjourned till Monday.</p>
<p>The Court was crowded on each day during the week with persons of distinction; outside Westminster Hall there were numbers of people, who huzzaed the Prisoners, on their arrival and departure each day.— The Jury, in compliance with a wish expressed to that effect, were allowed to communicate with their friends, and to walk out for the air attended by the Sheriff’s officers, that no one might have intercourse with them.</p>
<p>SEVENTH DAY.</p>
<p>MONDAY, JUNE 16. ACQUITTAL OF WATSON.</p>
<p>At twenty minutes past ten o’clock Lord Ellenborough proceeded to sum up the evidence to the Jury. His Lordship commenced by reading the precise form of the indictment against the prisoner, and explaining the four parts of which it was composed. He also laid down the ]aw of treason, and explained the precise bearings of the Statute of the 25th of Edward III. and the parts of this Statute which were applicable to the present case, namely, the compassing and imagining the death of the King and levying war against his authority. He did this not in any language of his own, but, as he expressed it, in the words of Lord Hale, Mr. Justice Foster, and some of the most eminent and best legal authorities, who were known in our country. By these eminent characters it had been laid down, that tumults which had merely a private object were not within the Statute of treason; but that those of a broader complexion, the breaking down fences and enclosures, and offences of that character, were within the law. The Learned Judge agreed with the Counsel for the prisoner, that the main question for the Jury was, whether the offences charged upon the prisoner were of the character of irregular and unprepared violence, or of a preconcerted and systematic plan. This was the main issue. Here he would observe, upon a remark of the Counsel for the prisoner, on the subject of the Law Officers of the Crown not calling either Harrison or Keans— why, it was evident that these men, if called, may demur to any question relative to their participation in this plot, yet the Counsel for the prisoner might have called them if they pleased, to shew the innocency of these transactions; for if they be innocent, then these witnesses would incur no responsibility, whereas, in the other vie, they must answer at their peril. The Learned Judge, with reference to the testimony of Castle, left it to the Jury to consider how far his testimony was confirmed by other evidence, and quoted the opinion of Lord Holt in favour of the admissibility of such testimony under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The Learned Judge then read <em>seriatim</em> the whole of the evidence for the prosecution-becoming exhausted of towards three o’clock,</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Bayley continued to read the evidence to the Jury, and occasionally point out the parts in the detail in which the testimony of Castle was confirmed.</p>
<p>When the evidence was gone through—</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough said he would only add a few observations to the Jury-great pains were taken (and praise-worthy ones for their client) by the Counsel for the prisoner, to nullify the testimony of Cassels.- The Crown were bound to furnish a list of witnesses to the prisoner, who was not bound to deliver the same list to the prosecutor; it might then possibly happen that if the Crown had the same opportunity of investigating the characters of those who exposed the immoral life of their witness, the same stigma might perhaps attach to those who made such a statement. It appeared, however, that the prisoner and his associates continued in intercourse with Cassels, from the 15th of November to the 2nd of December, notwithstanding his infamous toast at Hunt’s, which ought to have at once compelled them to discard him for ever. But the important confirmatory parts for the Jury to consider were the taking Mr. Cosser’s house, the pipe making by Bentley, and other matters of less, but not unimportant notice. The Learned Judge reverted at considerable length to the serious character of the evidence, and concluded by entreating that the Jury would give in such a verdict as would quiet their own consciences, protect the prisoner, and give him immunity from punishment if he deserved not to be visited by it; while they would, at the same time, feel that they were protecting the laws of the land, and giving them, and those who administer them, effective security.</p>
<p>The Jury now proposed to withdraw, and an officer a (Mr. Beaumont) was sworn to take them in charge during their deliberation.</p>
<p><em>Lord Ellenborough</em> then intimated to the Jury that they might have refreshment in the box before they retired; afterward, until their verdict was given in, or they could not expect to receive any.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Justice Abbot</em> suggested to them to have some tea or coffee.</p>
<p>Some of the Jury wished for sandwiches and wine and water and in a few minutes after manifested an anxiety to retire and consider their verdict without waiting for refreshment.</p>
<p><em>Lord Ellenborough</em> told them not to be in a hurry; the Court would very readily wait. Officers soon after escorted them out of Court to their room. Most of the barristers in the front seats, after the retirement of the Jury, stood up, as did Mr. Watson, folding his arms. Afterwards, he wrote a note to Mr. Harmer, his solicitor, then conversed with Mr. Wetherell. who was on the floor of the Court, and received Mr. Harmer’s answer.</p>
<p>The Officer, to whose care the Jury were committed, took the following oath:—</p>
<p>“You shall well and truly keep this Jury without meat, drink, or fire—you shall suffer no person whatever to speak to them, nor you yourself, unless it be to ask them whether they are agreed, or not.”</p>
<p>Before the return of the Jury, great huzzaing and clapping of hands were heard in the Hall. Much surprise was apparent in Court. Lord Ellenborough said the Hall ought to be cleared, and Mr. Sheriff Kirby went out, as if for that purpose, but quiet was presently restored, and it was found, that the applause had been given to the Lord Mayor, on his passage through the Hall.</p>
<p>At 20 minutes before seven, having been out an hour and 49 minutes, they returned into Court, and their names being called over,</p>
<p>Mr. Stirling, Clerk of the Crown Office, put the question— Gentlemen of the Jury, by whom do you pronounce your verdict? By the mouth of your Foreman?</p>
<p>The answer was given in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Mr. Stirling— Gentlemen, how say you? Is the Prisoner, James Watson, guilty or not guilty of the offence of High Treason with which he is charged?</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson- NOT GUILTY.</p>
<p>Mr. Stirling—You say he is Not Guilty; that is your verdict; and so say you all. Gentlemen, how say you, is he guilty of flying from justice?</p>
<p>Mr Richardson— Not guilty, my Lord.</p>
<p>Mr. Stirling— You say the Prisoner is not guilty; this is your verdict; and so say you all.</p>
<p>A Barrister, drawing aside the green curtain, instantly called out towards the Hall —” Acquitted.” He was heard only by a small part of the company, but their plaudits immediately made it known to the others, and were re-echoed from all parts of the Hall. The intelligence spread rapidly through Palace-yard and the adjoining streets. It was impossible to walk in the neighbourhood without hearing the words a hundred times in five minutes.</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough looked round this Court, as if his Lordship, in the first moments of the impression made by the verdict, seemed to think the plaudits proceeded from a part of the audience there; but his Lordship soon perceived that the utmost decorum prevailed within its doors.</p>
<p>As soon as silence was obtained, Mr. Watson asked permission to say a few words. One or two gentlemen near him intimated, that as his Counsel, Mr. Wetherall, had withdrawn, this might not be proper, but the Court appeared willing to hear him. Mr. Watson, bowing respectfully to the Jury, said, “Gentlemen, I thank you much.”</p>
<p><em>Lord Ellenborough</em> asked the Attorney-General if he had any other charge against the prisoner? The Attorney-General answered, “No, my Lord.”</p>
<p>Mr. Watson was then discharged; but, as the plaudits continued in the Hall, Lord Ellenborough expressed a wish that the Jury should wait a little time before they withdrew; and Mr. Watson, appearing to feel that the reason of the request might extend to him, also remained in Court. When he withdrew it was through the vaulted passage, which leads to Old Palace-yard, whence he passed with Mr. Harmer to Millbank.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the carriage, which had been drawn up near the door of the Hall to convey Mr. Watson back to the Tower, if that had been permitted by the verdict, was removed, and the Home Guards who attended it, retired.</p>
<p>In Spring Gardens Mr. Harmer and Mr. Watson were recognized and cheered.</p>
<p>COURT OF KING’S BENCH, TUESDAY.</p>
<p>Up to an advanced period of this morning it was supposed that the proceedings already instituted against the remaining State Prisoners would be carried on to trials, and a Jury were summoned yesterday, who remained in Court all this morning under that expectation.</p>
<p>At one o’clock Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper and Thomas Preston, were brought into Court, amidst the loudest acclamations, and placed at the bar, under the care of the Yeoman of the Guard, as usual. They were all dressed in black. At twenty minutes before one the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General had entered the Court, when the following Jury were impannelled—</p>
<p>John Franklin, John Hunter, John Kemp, Alex Chapp, George Barber, Charles Hewitt, John Rose, Robert Hartley, Joseph Smith, William Fell, William Gurdler Muthlow, and Wm. Cleghorn.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General then addressed the Court as follows:—</p>
<p>“May it please your Lordships,</p>
<p>“It becomes my duty to inform the Court, that it is not my intention to call any witnesses to support the charge against the prisoners.”</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough—“Gentlemen of the Jury— as no evidence is offered by his Majesty’s Attorney-General against the prisoners, it becomes your duty to find them Not Guilty.”</p>
<p>Clerk of the Court —“Gentlemen, are Arthur Thistlewood, Richard Hooper, and Thomas Preston, found guilty of the Treason whereof they stand indicted, or not guilty?”</p>
<p>Foreman of the Jury.-“Not Guilty.”</p>
<p>Clerk of the Court.—“How say you, did they fly from justice?”</p>
<p>Foreman of the Jury.—“No.”</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough—“Mr. Attorney General, have you any further charge against the prisoners?”</p>
<p>The Attorney-General—“I have no other charge My Lord.”</p>
<p>Lord Ellenborough—“You say you have no further charge—therefore I shall order then forthwith to be discharged.”</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer now conducted the prisoners out of the Court the back way behind the Bench, under the Piazzas of the House of Lords. An immense concourse of people were waiting in Palace-yard, in expectation that they would come out that way, but one or two persons recognized them under the Piazzas, and immediately, by their shouts, made known their discovery to those in front of Westminster Hall.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The acquittal of obscure and unprotected men, June 1817</p>

<p>Leeds Mercury - Saturday 21 June 1817
p2-3</p>
<p>THE MERCURY</p>
<p>The result of the trials for High Treason will do more towards removing discontent, allaying irritation, and tranquillising the public mind, than all the unconstitutional and coercive measures recommended by the present advisers of the Crown, or we should rather say, that this result will materially counteract the pernicious effects which these measures have a tendency to produce. The acquittal of obscure and unprotected men, against whom all the power of the Crown was arrayed, will afford a practical proof that there still exists in our Constitution a real barrier against oppression, which cannot be passed by the most despotic ministers. A proof, the cogency of which, the most ignorant and illiterate will be able fully to appreciate. It evinces that the trial by jury, which forms an integral part in the British Constitution, has not been deteriorated by those influences, which have, so essentially impaired the representative part of the system. We also rejoice in the acquittal of the state prisoners on another ground, because this solemn verdict of the jury will deter Ministers from instituting prosecutions for high treason on light and insufficient grounds, on the credit of such witnesses as CASTLE, or on the information of such incendiaries as OLIVER. It was the acquittal of Mr. HARDy, HORNE TOOKE, and their associates, in the year 1794, which preserved at that awful period, the ark of the Constitution from perishing on the rocks of anarchy, or of being swallowed up in the abyss of despotism. It was a period full of cruel inquietude and alarm, the liberties and lives of the people seemed in imminent danger of being sacrificed at the caprice of an overbearing administration, when the firm and upright conduct of a jury, presented its impenetrable shield between the accused and the accusers; though the indictment had in effect been found by both Houses of Parliament, and though every means possessed by the Crown, had been resorted to, to insure their conviction. The decision of the jury in the case to which we refer, operated almost like a charm; its effect was instantaneous; it at once restored confidence to the people, checked the vindictive proceedings of the Ministers of the Crown, and prevented that fatal catastrophe, which at that period seemed inevitable,</p>
<p>IN the House of Lords on Monday, LORD LIVERPOOL, in answer to the inquiries of EARL GREY, distinctly admitted that Mr. OLIVER was an agent employed by Ministers, for the purpose of detecting conspiracies; but it is now evident, from numerous facts, that this spy, finding no materials for his occupation in any existing plots, actively engaged in the fabrication of them, and that on the most extensive scale. This diabolical plot against the lives and liberties of his Majesty’s subjects has already been the subject of investigation by the Magistracy of this Riding, the proceedings and result of which is a flattering confirmation of the accuracy of the statement we presented to the public on this subject. We trust that it will also become the subject of Parliamentary inquiry: the honour and dignity of Parliament, the safety of the country, and the character of the Executive Government, are deeply implicated in probing this matter to the bottom. Ministers, if innocent of any participation in this plot, ought most zealously to aid this investigation. To oppose inquiry, will be to involve themselves in the foul suspicions; for should it appear that Ministers have, we do not say participated in the plot, (for that would be the blackest treason) but even by their negligence connived at it ;— if, on the first intimation of the misconduct of their agent, they did not instantly recall him, and if, on proof of his guilt, they persist in protecting him, it will be the duty of Parliament to address the PRINCE REGENT, to remove these ministers for ever from his councils. This, indeed, on other grounds, would be a consummation most devoutly to be wished. The Secret Committee of the House of Commons have not yet made their Report, and it is suggested in the <em>Times</em>, that an investigation into the case of OLIVER ought to precede the delivery of their report. OLIVER himself will, no doubt, be called before the Committee, who Will probably find it their duty to hand him over to that confinement in which he has been the means of involving so many innocent men.</p>
