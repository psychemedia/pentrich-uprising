*They were days of direct action: the Diggers and the Levellers, the Plug Drawer rioters and the Pentrich rebels; the followers of King Ludd, and Captain Swing; of juries, and spies; of executions, and alibis.*

*The tales of their actions are many; the songs of their deeds are still sung.*

*And today? Today we will hear some of those stories; some of those songs; so sit back, and let the Protest tales begin.*
