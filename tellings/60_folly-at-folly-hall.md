Folly Hall - https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/Folly_Hall,_Huddersfield
According to local historian Philip Ahier in The Legends and Traditions of Huddersfield and Its District, there were two theories to explain the nickname:
the location was prone to flooding, so it was a folly to build anything there
it was a folly to build anything so far from the centre of Huddersfield
Ahier also noted that locals referred to the building as "The Cottage by the Sea".

Discovering Old Huddersfield (1993-2002) by Gordon & Enid Minter:
Folly Hall, the area at the end of Colne Road and the bottom of Chapel Hill, owes its name to the enterprise of one Marmaduke Hebden, a man of property in Huddersfield in the eighteenth century. Duke Hebden was the only Huddersfield man to invest in the new Huddersfield to Woodhead turnpike of 1768. Confident that the new road would extend development southwards from the town centre, Hebden commissioned Blind Jack Metcalf to build a row of four tenements near to the bridge over the river. Most people, however, considered it unwise to build so far from the centre of things and soon, probably even before it was finished, Hebden's building was being referred to as "Folly Hall". The building, which became the Commercial Inn, stood for one hundred and fifteen years before it was demolished in 1890.

Folly Ha11 is associated with the famous " Folly Hall Fight! " which took place on June 9, 1817. There are two entirely different versions of this "skirmish" which "took place at a time of great agitation " and unrest among the people of Haddersfield. The first was given by Mr. John Hanson in the article previously quoted `[John Hansen, of the Lead Works, Folly Hall, in an article entitled "Huddersfield Twenty Years Ago," written for the defunct " Huddersfield Chronicle" or "The Huddersfield Weekly News " (June 1, 1878)]`:

" This (an open field opposite a former primitive foundry) was the scene of the first famous Folly Hall Fight, where General Croft gave those notable words of command, ' Front rank, kneel,down, rear rank, fire,' which struck terror in the hearts of our brave yeomanry cavalry."

" This 'Folly Hall Fight', as it was called, took place at a time of great agitation. In many places, the people were drilling and arming to fight for their rights and liberties. Croft was a brave old soldier who had fought in many a battle. He was drilling a squad of 'rebels' in the field by the River. The Yeomanry had been apprised of this and came down valiantly to disperse the ' rebels.' When they (the Yeomanry) reached the bridge they made a stand to reconnoitre. Just at that moment, the old veteran, in the course of his drill insruetions, bawled out at the top of his voice, the the *(sic)* terrible words, 'Front rank, kneel down! rear rank, fire.' A few pistols went off,  hereupon our valiant Bobadils took alarm, turned their horses sharp round and galloped up Chapel Hill as if they were riding a steeplechase. They ventured not to check their flight until they ran back to cover in the back yard of "The Rose and Crown." (p. 228). Some sadly malicious people even said they wounded a horse in the nose with a pistol shot, to show what dangers they had braved, and the terrible jeopardy in which their valuable lives had been placed. In all probability, the malicious people who said so were not far wide of the mark. Thus ended the Folly Hall fight, where the vanquished fled without being attacked or even threatened) and the victors were wholly unaware of the brilliant repulse they had effected."

The second version of the " Folly Hall Fight" is given by Mr. James Mayhall in his " Annals of Yorkshire " (Vol. 1., p. 263) under the year 1817 :—

" On the 9th of June, some hundreds of persons assembled about midnight, at a place adjoining the town of Hudders?eld,
called Folly Hall Bridge, under a delusive expectation that they would be joined by other insurgents from various parts of the kingdom, and that, when united, their force would be sufficiently strong to overturn the government of the country ! The approach of half a dozen yemmmry cavalry produced considerable alarm amongst them; but they mustered military ardour sufficient to fire several shots, and one of the cavalry horses was wounded in the head. The yeomzmry, not considering it prudent to engage with so great a disparity of numbers, retreated for the purpose of obtaining a reinforcement, but before they could return to the field, a panic had seized the motley assembly at the bridge, and
in a few minutes, their force was completely dispersed."

" Four and twenty persons, charged with having in some way participated in this futile enterprise, were subsequently apprehended and committed to York Castle, and several others escaped. At the Assizes, in July, ten of the prisoners were put upon their trial before Baron Wood; part of them charged with stealing firearms on their way to the place of the rendezvous, and the remainder with aiding and abetting certain persons unknown, in firing at, with an intent to kill, maim, or disable Mr. David Alexander, the yeomanry cavalryman whose horse was shot in the head. Both the charges being ill—supported by evidence, all the prisoners put upon their trial were acquitted."

> We had waterworks in Huddersfield but they were of a very primitive kind, as you will see. The source of our water supply was the river at Folly Hall or Engine Bridge. In a cottage near to Mr. Eastwood’s dyeworks was erected a forcing engine or pump. This was driven by a waterwheel and sent the turbid water up to Huddersfield. The main pipes that conveyed the water were large tree trunks, with a three and a half inch hole bored through them lengthways. They were tapered down at one end, and the bore at the other end widened a little to admit the tapering end, thus making what is called a faucet joint. These wooden pipes ran under the Canal, up the hill to the top of Outcote Bank, then along what was called the Upper Road to the higher part of the town, and finally discharged their water into a small reservoir which stood near Mr. Midgley’s warehouse. From this reservoir the town received its scanty supply. You may judge of the size of the mains from the following incident. It so happened that the supply to one part of the town was stopped, so that the inhabitants of that part were left “high and dry.” Much digging and searching was done to discover the obstruction, until at last the cause of the mischief was revealed. Imagine the astonishment of all when it was found that a large trout had stuck fast in one of the pipes. Connected with these waterworks was an old woman named Betty Earnshaw. She was rather a masculine looking woman, with a peculiarity about one of her eyes. She carried a large turn-key on her shoulder to turn on the water in the various parts of the town. The servant girls who had to rise early on washing mornings well knew how to get an early supply of water for their work. Betty also professed to tell fortunes for the silly lasses, so that what with water-turning and fortune-telling, old Betty managed to turn many an honest penny, and contrived to be never at a loss for a drop of “something good.” Whilst a lad I had to go to Lockwood for milk, as we had no milk hawkers in those days. As I passed Folly Hall I used to be attracted by the screeching and groaning of the old pumping engine. It sounded as if it had not had a drop of oil for twelve months or more. I would peep in through the broken window and watch the crazy thing at work. It would make a desperate effort, stand for a few seconds and then groaningly move off again. Thus painfully and laboriously was the scanty supply of water pumped up from the polluted river. A little further on, at Folly Hall, my eye caught sight of the blaze of a furnace. I crossed the road and looked into a cottage through the place where a pane of glass had been. There I saw an old woman hard at work breaking up the pigs of iron with a heavy sledge hammer. After she had thus broken it, she put the pieces upon her head, carried them up some steps, and threw them into the furnace. Those who have been engaged in this hard hot work of furnace-tending, and those who have seen the swarthy grimy toilers toiling and perspiring at their work may imagine whether or not that old woman fairly earned her bread. Another time I went behind the cottage, and there saw a horse trotting round in a gin which worked a large pair of blacksmith’s bellows, used to melt down the iron in the furnace. They had no other method at that day, as it was before the invention of the fan or rotary bellows. I have every reason to believe that this was the first iron foundry in Huddersfield or neighbourhood. I never knew or heard tell of one before this one. It was established by two partners, Messrs. Holmes and Prince. They carried on business for some time and might have done very well. Prince, the experienced partner, left the firm; Holmes, who had previously been coachman to Colonel Smithson, knew nothing of the business. By careless and intemperate habits he allowed the business to fall away, and he himself finally became a bailiff. The next iron foundry was that started by Jonathan Brook, at the bottom of Outcote Bank, and after that came the foundry of Mills at Aspley. The site on which the little foundry at Folly Hall stood has seen several changes. The foundry was succeeded by a brewery; the brewery by soapworks; these by leadworks; after that by iron-works again; and in 1833 the late George Smith established a spirit store and dram shop on the ground where one of the little cottages once stood.

> I can well recollect the time when our streets were all in darkness. People went about at night with hand glass lanterns, and our shops were lighted up with candles or muddy oil lamps. It was then so decreed by our authorities that our main streets should be lighted up. For this purpose lamp-posts were put down at wide intervals. These were furnished with glasses something like an inverted beehive. In them were placed oil lamps which gave a dim uncertain light, and served only to make darkness visible. By eleven or twelve o’clock they were usually nearly all “winked up.” Gas was not known at that day as an illuminator. The first gas used in Huddersfield was made by Wm. Waite, a plumber and glazier. His shop was next door to the Globe Inn. His gas apparatus was in the back workshop, and from there he lighted up his front shop window. This new light in the district created great wonder. The shop front was surrounded nightly by a crowd of gaping spectators, who marvelled greatly how anyone could set lire to the end of a cold lead pipe. The first inn in Huddersfield in which gas was burnt was the White Lion, in Cross Church Street. Mr. Waite made a large leathern bag something like a round bellows, and took it to the inn filled with gas, placed it under the table in which a hole was bored to admit a pipe that stood about six inches above the table. There the gas was ignited and consumed, to the great astonishment of the jovial, though perhaps not specially intelligent, frequenters of the house.

In the second edition of the *Leeds Mercury* of Saturday, 14 June, 1817, we get the first report of a disturbance on the outskirts of Huddersfield earlier that week.

Second Edition

...


The neighbourhood of Huddersfield was thrown into consternation on Sunday night, by an attack made about 12 o'clock, on six of the horse-patrole, at Folly-Hall Bridge, near that place, by a number of men with arms. A volley was fired, and one of the horses struck on the head, by a ball, which has since been extracted. The patrole finding their number too small to attack their adversaries, retired after a shot had been fired by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was wounded; and by the time the main body with the infantry reached the place, the whole of the assailants had dispersed.

PROJECTED INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE

...

We regret, however, to state, that an attempt was made in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to assassinate one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, about one o'clock on Monday morning, by firing a loaded pistol, the ball of which lodged in the forehead of the horse belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Huddersfield, but the ball has been extracted, and the horse is likely to recover. ... Five persons have been apprehended at Huddersfield, and its neighbourhood, on a charge of being concerned in the former of these daring outrages.— They have since been committed to York Castle, on a charge of malicious firing: they passed through this place yesterday afternoon, accompanied by an escort of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry.

The following is a list of their names and residence:

Abram Oldham, and John Oldham, of Honley.  
Isaac Johnson, and Joshua Knowles, of Holmfirth.  
John Rhodes, (late of Holbeck), Holmfirth.  

...

We feel great satisfaction in having to state that the most perfect tranquillity has prevailed here during the whole of the past week, and that the alarm by which the announcement of so many plots had produced, has nearly subsided.

A month later, several of the individuals involved in several different events in an around Huddersfield on June 8th were committed to York Castle to await trial. The committals included  ?? as well as the shooting at Folly Hall.

TO DO

A dramatic and rather inflammatory account of the events appeared a couple of days after the committal in the *Leeds Intelligencer* of [Monday 14 July 1817](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000268/18170714/023/0003), an account that was widely circulated elsewhere over the next few days:

London Courier and Evening Gazette, [Wednesday 16 July 1817](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001476/18170716/004/0002)

We copy the following article from the *Leeds Intelligencer* of Monday, received this morning:—

"The state affairs in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield has been much more serious than we imagined, and there is still some ground of alarm, for the further probable progress of the disaffected in that quarter; Twenty-three prisoners, in all, have been sent to York Castle, some of them charged with high-treason, others with rioting, stealing arms, & c. Eighteen still remain in custody at Huddersfield, of whom four, and fifth since discharged, were apprehended on Tuesday night last, namely, *John Spencer*, Cleckheaton; *Edward Fletcher*, cardmaker, Hightown; *Benjamin Heptonstall*, cloth-dresser, Hightown *James Clegg*, of Hightown; and *————— Sampson*, Robert-Town, who is discharged. Besides these, about 50 men, against whom there are informations far having been concerned in the late outrages, have absconded; but they are diligently looked for by the civil authorities, and hopes are entertained that many of them will yet be apprehended. One of these fellows formerly resided in Leeds, which he was forced to quit. This precious *Reformer* of the State was, it appears, to have been Lieutenant-General of that insurrectionary army, which the disaffected hoped would have existed in great force on the day fixed for the general rising. His late residence is close to Folly-hall Bridge, at which the small party of Yeomanry under Capt. ARMYTAGE were attacked by the insurgents; and the deserted house now bears the mark of having been struck by a ball from the fire of the infatuated madmen w|io were marching to their own destruction and that of their country.

"The information previously obtained saved Huddersfield that night from the most horrible fate. The band which was met at Folly-Hall-bridge constituted only one part of the numerous insurgents, whose plan was to have attacked the town simultaeously and by surprise. In the hope that the Magistracy would have intimation of their approach, the night of attack was changed from that of Monday the 9th to Sunday the 8th of June.— Marching silently and rapidly to the execution of their plan, thp military were to have been suddenly secured and their arms taken by the insurgents; while the Magistrates were to have been seized, kept as hostages, and compelled to use their authority in favour of the insurrection. Several individuals were marked out for massacre, and the daring ruffians who were engaged in these outrageous proceedings entertained confident hopes that the town would have been in their undisputed possession before morning. Plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent, no doubt, would have succeeded the authority of the Magistracy and the rule of the laws.

"Most fortunately, intelligence had been obtained of the meditated attack. The Civil and Militaty Authorities were on the alert. The spirited corps of yeomanry, as well as the regular troops, were under arms. The town was in a complete state of preparation for defence and encounter with the insurgents, at Folly-Hall-bridge, by convincing them their plan was detected, frustrated, for the present, their enterprize and their hopes. Many of the inhabitants heard the firing, the alarm of the bugle, the galloping of the cavalry through the streets, and awaited, in breathless anxiety, the result.

"A master shoemaker, of Huddersfield, in respectable credit, and flourishing business, is another of the persons who have absconded. He has been seen in Hamburgh since his flight; and, it is to be hoped, will repent him, in his wretched exile, of the courses which have compelled him to fly from those blessings in this county which he was unworthy to enjoy.

"In our last we announced the apprehension of a man at Huddersfield, on Friday the 4th instant, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State. He turns out to be one of the Thornhill Lees Delegates, *Benjamin Whiteley*, of Holmfirth, clothdrawer; and has been in the regular receipt for the labour of himself and his wife, of not less than *four pounds per week!!!*. He is committed to Salisbury prison.

"One of the chief Conspirators, now in gaol, warily avoided engaging personally in the outrages. He, however, assisted actively at all the meetings for arranging the plan; and has been impeached since the apprehension of some of his accomplices. On being taken up himself, he said, he had for many years kept the Law and the Governinent at defiance and now he was betrayed to destruction by a set of his own blockheads at last! While he was in custody of the Constables who were charged to convey him, escorted by cavalry, to York Castle, he was placed in an upper room, till the horses were ready; he had seized the opportunity to attempt self-destruction, and the Constables cut him down after he had actually suspended himself from a bedstead in the apartment!

"On the accuracy of the preceding particulars the public may rely; as we have carefully examined into the truth of the facts, during the past week, on the spot. While there has been so much falsehood and misrepresentation palmed upon the country, we have much pleasure in being also able to state, that after making the most diligent inquiry at Huddersfield, we cannot find that any one of the numerous persons apprehended has pretended to charge Oliver, or any other individual, with having seduced or entrapped him. Not one, indeed, as far as we can learn, appears to have even had any knowledge of Oliver's visit to this district.

"The spirited and highly respectable corps of Huddersfield Yeomanry (100 strong) are above all praise, for their late and present patriotic exertions."

The *Leeds Mercury* took a calmer and more considered view:

THE HUDDERSFIELD INSURRECTION

An inflated and highly exaggerated account of the state of the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield, during the past month, has been published in the Leeds Intelligencer, and copied into the London Ministerial papers. Such a publication, on the eve of the trial at York, we hold to be extremely reprehensible, and must, as far as it is believed, have a tendency to prejudice the minds of the jury appointed to sit in judgement upon the lives of the accused. To assert in a public print before the trials come on, and of course on *ex parte* evidence, that the object of the prisoners was "massacre," and that their plans were to be consummated by "plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent," is to prejudge their cause, and to deprive these unfortunate men of the benefit of that salutary maxim of the English law, which holds every man to be innocent till a jury of his countrymen has pronounced him guilty. Without pretending to be at all in the secrets of the insurgents, we must say, we have too favourable an opinion of our species and of our countrymen, to believe that any numerous body of them in a particular neighbourhood, could be brought to be the actors in a sedition, that was to inflict "massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage," upon their neighbours, "to a fearful extent." The intention of the insurgents, as far as we can learn, was to effect a "bloodless revolution," and the purpose of seizing and *disarming* the military, as stated is the account before us, seems to favour that supposition. That a bloodless revolution could have been effected, is, to be sure, a supposition too gross to be entertained by any set of men of common understanding; but Mr. Oliver, it seems, had the address to persuade the leaders that a project of this kind was practicable, and his dupes were so utterly ignorant as to adopt the absurdity. This fact may serve to shew of what kind of materials the Huddersfield branch of the conspiracy was formed. How many men and boys (for there was, it seems, a considerable proportion of the latter) assembled at *Folly*-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th, we cannot learn with any degree of certainty, but some estimate may be formed of their strength from the fact, that a detachment of newly-raised Yeomanry Cavalry put to flight and entirely dispersed the insurgent army ! while the only blood that flowed on the occasion on either side, was the blood of a horse, and the only other mark of violence inflicted was, as the Intelligencer states, the mark of a bail which struck a deserted house ! We do not wish to speak with levity of a proceeding which every friend to his country must condemn, but when we see a local act of popular violence, exaggerated to the bulk of a wide spreading insurrection, we feel it to be our duty to remove the deception, by lowering down the colouring to the standard of truth.

We have hitherto cautiously abstained from entering into the details of the violent proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield on the night of the 8th of June, satisfying ourselves with stating from time to time the committals of the prisoners to the County gaol; and this course we should have pursued, leaving the facts to be developed upon the trials, had not the exaggerated statements made in the Intelligencer induced us to depart from that determination. It now, however, becomes proper to state, that ever since the year 1812, when the Luddite system prevailed in Yorkshire, and raged more especially in the South-western plots of this Riding, there has been considerable irritation existing in the minds of some of the lower classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. This disposition, the extreme distress suffered by the labouring part of the community during the past year, tended materially to increase. For a time, the hope of Parliamentary Reform allayed the public dissatisfaction, by affording some prospect of relief, and petitions for that purpose were drawn up and signed very generally; but no sooner was the Bill for the suspension of the *Habeas Corpus* Act passed into a law, then hope gave place to despair; and soon after, a number of designing men, seizing the opportunity, did not hesitate to inculcate the opinion, that nothing short of a revolution could terminate the general suffering. Of these pestilent characters, the notorious Mr. Oliver was one of the principal; and we have the authority of the wife of one of the persons mentioned in the Intelligencer as a principal conspirator (George Dawson), delivered in the presence of three respectable witnesses, for saying that as long since as nearly two months ago, Oliver was in communication with the ring-leaders of the sedition, and that on one occasion he was a visitor at Dawson's house. On the same authority we state, that Mr. Oliver had held conferences with George Taylor, the leader of the mal-content forces, on the night of the 8th of June, and it is known that both Dawson and Taylor have since absconded. How Oliver conducted himself in his visits to Huddersfield, may be collected from the testimony of Dawson's wife, who says, that one morning, while she was at breakfast at Dawson's house, Oliver, among other inflammatory conversation, said -" They are all in readiness, in London. There is no occasion for bloodshed. We have only to seize the military and disarm them, and the thing is done." He added, that he had been concerned with Despard;  that just before the Colonel and his associates were apprehended, he was going into a private room with them, but recollecting that he had a little business of his own to transact, he stepped out. and had not been gone half an hour, before they were all taken.

Under this kind of excitation, it is no wonder that the persons to whom such conversation was addressed, began to form traitorous designs, or rather perhaps, to cherish hopes that designs already formed might be realized. The leaders, it appears, held frequent communications with the subordinate agents. The plot thickened daily. A considerable number of men in the lowest ranks of life became involved in the conspiracy. Sunday night, the 8th of June, was appointed for the rising. Two or three hundred persons, it is said, many of them boys from 14 to 20 years, assembled at a place bearing the appropriate name of *Folly*-hall-bridge. Taylor placed himself at their head, and at 12 o'clock, the moment for commencing operations, this fanatic addressed his followers in these terms "Now, my lads, all England is in arms-our liberties are secure— the rich will be poor, and the poor will be rich." To this rabble a detachment of six Yeomanry Cavalry was at first opposed, and we verily believe that had the cavalry , small as their number were, thought proper to advance, they would have routed the insurgents, They however judged it prudent to retreat, and being reinforced by a body of their comrades, they returned to witness the dispersion of an unorganized mob that had been drawn together, some by actual force, others by an idle curiosity, and others, no doubt, with criminal designs. In the mean time, a sort of under-plot was acting, and a number of marauders were passing about the neighbourhood, forcing the peaceable inhabitants to open their doors and surrender their fire-arms. At Honley, they broke into the house of Mr. Armitage, who observed that one of the bandits seemed better dressed than his associates,that he was not like one of this country-men, and that he talked like a Londoner."

The Magistrates, who appear to have displayed a more than ordinary share of vigour, soon found means to discover and to arrest a number of the persons engaged in these criminal excesses, and twenty-four of them have been committed to York Castle, to take their trials at the Assizes, which commence this day, while about half that number still remain in confinement in the prison at Huddersfield. It is much to be regretted that the persons apprehended, and about to be put upon their trials, have for the most part, been, at most, merely the dupes of the leaders of this miserable conspiracy, and that the instigators, including Mr. Oliver, the London delegate, have been suffered to escape.

YORK LAMMAS ASSIZES.

These Assizes commenced at the Castle in York on Monday the 21st July. Mr. Baron Wood presided in the criminal Court. Tine following is his charge to the Grand Jury.

"*Gentlemenn of the Grand Jury,—I am sorry to observe, there are a larger number prisoners than has been usual at the Summer Assizes, and particularly concerned to find that the number is increased by no less than twenty-four persons from the Western part of this county, charged with committing grievous riots, and of being concerned in tumultuary outrages. I was in hopes that the examples made in this place, a few years ago, would have made such an impression upon the minds of these people, as would have deterred them from engaging in future in any similar acts of outrage. I am sorry that they have not produced this effect, and that this disposition to outrage does not seem have been repressed.

"The first prisoner in the Calendar, charged with being present in these tumultuary assemblages, is also charged with feloniously holding, presenting and levelling a gun, with intent to kill or do some grievous bodily harm. This offence, as at present described, is only a misdemeanor, and not a felony, and I make this observation, because, from the use of the word feloniously, it seems have been the intention to charge it as a capital offence under Lord Ellenbnrough's act; but in order to constitute this offence, there should be, in addition to the levelling and presenting the gun, the further act either of firing at, or of pulling the trigger with such intention, and thereby to kill or do grievous bodily harm to some of his Majesty's subjects. The offence, it stands, is only misdeanieanor, though a misdeameanor attended with very aggravating circumstances. There are others charged with stealing fire-arms, and the stealing of arms by force is undoubtedly a felony, and a most enormous offence, and bills of felony will be presented to you against these persons. With respect to the persons charged generally with being concerned in these tumultuary assemblages, it seems to me that their offence will amount only to a misdeameanor more or less aggravated; what their precise or ultimate object was, does not appear from any evidence before the Court— that it was in the highest degree illegal can admit of no doubt, and it is deeply to be lamented that any persons should be so infatuated and deluded as to engage in tumultuary proceedings of this description. It is true they may produce much present mischief, but Justice will certainly overtake the parties who engage in them, and their schemes will issue only in their own misery and ruin, if not death. It is unquestionably the duty of every good subject, and more especially of the magistracy, to exert themselves to the utmost in the suppression of these dangerous outrages, and in the detection and apprehension of the persons who engage in them that they may be brought to condign punishment.

SUMMER ASSIZES. YORK, Saturday, July 26. CROWN SIDE.

B. Lockwood, of Salford, in Lockwood, in the West Riding of this county, cloth dresser; G.  Waffenden, of the some place, cloth dresser ; J. Wilson, of the same place and profession ; and J. Jysop, of the same place add profession, were indicted for a captial offence, in aiding and abetting a tumultuous assembly, one of whom fired at D. Alexander, on the night of the Bth of June last, at Folly-hall-bridge. near Huddersheld, with the intent of murdering the said D. Alexander.

Capt. Armitage deposed, that he commanded the yeomanry cavalry of the district of Huddersfield ; was called on the night of Sunday the 9th June, upon information that a tumultuary assemblage had collected at Folly-hall, or Engine-bridge, near Huddersfield. He proceeded with six patrole and the constable Whitehead, Witness saw an assemblage of men on the bridge; but from the darkness of the night he could not perceive whether they had arms not. He called out to the constable, to speak to them. The constable obeyed the summons; and as soon as he had come up witness observed fire flash in the pair of one of the guns or pistols borne by the rioters. He was certain that the flash proceeded from the party on the bridge. Instantaneously a gun was fired from the same party; and soon afterwards several others. All the shots might about 20. Witness remained till about 10 shots were fired. He saw a moving body beyond the centre of the bridge; and concluding that the intervening space was occupied by the party, and that subsequently their numbers were considerable, and considering that his party only consisted of six to oppose them, he thought it prudent to retreat to Huddersfield for an increase of force. He accordingly did so ; and returning afterwards, when he had gained an accession of numbers, found that the rioters were dispersed.

G. Whitehead, a constable at Huddersfield, who accompanied the patrole, confirmed the testimony of the preceding witness.

D. Alexander, one the yeomanry caValry of Huddersfield, was on duty on the 8th of June. He was a little in  advance; he halted at the end of bridge, where he saw men ; they appeared to amount to 60 or 70. Before the constable spoke, the mob called out "Who comes there?" Immediately a gun flashed in the pan, another piece was fired, and soon after several more. At the third shot his horse staggered ; the party retreated after several other shots were fired. About an hour afterwards he examined his horse’s head, and took out of it a pistol ball.

G. Armitage stated, that on the night of the 8th June he was at Lockwood, a short distance from Huddersfield, with C. Bamshaw. Two persons with guns stopped them, and said they must go along with them to a field close to Engine-bridge, as it had been resolved to try how many could be mustered. He saw none of the prisoners in the field except Wilson. They received orders to advance to the bridge. Two men with scythes, stretched out, stood on the crown of the bridge, and prevented any one from passing. At the bridge he saw Lockwood and Woffenden, who had guns. He saw Jysop there also with a scythe.— Croft appeared to have the command, and directed who had arms to arrange themselves on each side of the road, while those who had not stood in the middle. He then ordered those with arms to kneel. Heard the trampling of the horses feet when the cavalry were advancing; and then Croft calls out, three times, "Who comes there?" He did not hear what answer was made; but Croft ordered those who had arms to fire.

The prisoners said nothing in their defence; but severa] witnesses were called in their behalf, who gave them good characters. The Jury retired about 10 minutes; and on their return, found all the prisoners— Not Guilty.
