Saint James's Chronicle - Tuesday 31 March 1812

The Derby Assizes were attended by great crowds of persons. One of the most dangerous gangs of nightly depredators that has infested England for many years has been broken up. They were formed by one *John England*, who resided at a stone house, the first on the right hand on entering Derby, from Nottingham. This gang was wholly made up of deserters, with the exception of England, who, as a brewer, labourer, and, petty-huckster, used every art for the purpose of finding a cover for the rest. He never went out himself with his comrades to plunder, but always pointed out the object; and his concubine (wife of one Matthew Bush, of Wessington, who was principal witness against one of the principal depredators on these trials, and who was attempted to be seized as a deserter as he entered the hall,) provided them with caps, masks, and other things necessary for disguise. He used to have a share of the plunder but at length be outwitted himself. Three of these deptedators, James Tomlinson, Perceval Cook, and John England, were put to the bar, charged with entering a dweiling-house, at midnight, on the 23d of Dec and robbing Mr. Hunt, at Ocbrock ilill, of thirty-five one-pound notes, and several other articles. The prisoners were found *Guilty*. Cook and Tomlinson were then convicted on another indictment, of the robbery of the house of Mr. Brentneal, at Lockgrange.
