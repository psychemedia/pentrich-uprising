<p>In terms of English uprisings, the “Pentrich Revolution” of June 1817, and the band of insurrectionists who assembled at South Wingfield in Derbyshire to march to Nottingham, is perhaps one of the better known tales, at least amongst those with a passing interest in such things. The sentences inflicted on those involved probably go some way to explaining that, but that is a story for another day.</p>
<p>But whilst the general uprising the Pentrich rebels believed they were participating in failed to materialise, there was at least one other place where men had gathered a night earlier, and with similar expectations.</p>
<p>And that place was Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Huddersfield June 4, 1812<br />
DEAR SIR,— The Luddites continue very active in stealing fire-arms in the neighbourhood, not a night passes but we hear of them prowling in great numbers, throwing the peaceable inhabitants into the utmost consternation, demanding their fire-arms, and threatening them with instant death on refusal.</p>
<p>Yours most respectfully.</p>
</div>
<p>The news perhaps brings a reminder of the troubled times around Huddersfield, five years before, in the Spring and early Summer of 1812, when the machine breakers attacked local mills, and notoriously killed one of the local mill-owners. Tragic times that had resulted in fourteen men being hanged at York for actions associated with the Luddite cause. But the deterrence effect of such consequences were, perhaps, fading in current memory; and once again, there was a sense that <em>direct action</em> was called for; that direct action was <em>necessary</em>; that it was the <em>Right Thing</em> to do.</p>

<p>ARMS STEALING.</p>
<p>The system of violence, intimidation and outrage, familiarly and too well known by the cant name of <em>Luddism</em>, which has so long afflicted and disgraced this district, has of late assumed a new aspect, and diverged into a still more menacing and alarming species of depredation—that of obtaining_fire-arms in the night, from the houses of individuals, by force and intimidation. Of the prevalence of this alarming species of midnight-robbery, we have several instances to lay before our readers, On Wednesday se’nnight a number of persons, about seven or eight, undisguised, went about midnight to the house of Mr. Thomas Milnes, Storrs-Hill, Horbury, and having roused him from his sleep, demanded entrance. Mr. Milnes not appearing inclined to obey this mandate, they threatened if he did not instantly open the door, they would immediately force it. Mr. Milnes finding he could make no availing resistance to their demand, gave them admittance— They then insisted upon having his fire-arms; but on being satisfied that he had none, they demanded money and refreshment; he gave them some silver, and bread, cheese and beer. They then requested that he would allow them to take some to some poor fellows who they said were watching at a distance; with this requisition he thought it also prudent to comply, and they then civilly took their leave of him. On Sunday night these depredators made a further attack on several houses at Netherton, (a place in the immediate vicinity of Horbury) where they succeeded in obtaining seven or eight stand of arms; and upon this occasion they behaved with peculiar atrocity, by wantonly firing several musket balls into one of the houses. The success of these nocturnal depredators on this occasion is the more remarkable, as on the day before, (Saturday) the Chief Constable of the District, and the Constable of Horbury, had received directions to receive the fire-arms of such of the inhabitants as were disposed to give them up, and which they carried into effect the same day, most of the inhabitants readily giving up their arms to the custody of the Civil Magistrates, but some few refused. The Constables were much hooted and abused by the populace whilst they were executing this duty, and one of the mob had the effrontery to take from his pocket a handful of musket balls which he threw into the air, exclaiming “Here are hail-stones for you.” It is said there is a person in Horbury employed in casting these leaden messengers of death. Every article of lead, such as pumps and water-spouts, &amp;c. which can be readily conveyed away, are constantly disappearing. The glaring violation of the laws of society and of private property, evinced in the nocturnal visits of these burglarious plunderers, though of itself an evil of the greatest magnitude, is, as it were, lost in the contemplation of those more atrocious purposes for which these instruments of death are collected, and which the imagination almost sickens at the thought of. It is probable that these plunderers may deceive themselves with the notion, that as they do not actually break into the houses, their offence is not a capital one; but they ought to know, that to obtain property of any kind by threats of violence, is an offence equally penal, and will subject them to the punishment of death.</p>
<p>On Thursday se’nnight, the shed, adjoining the barn of Mr. Robert Waltshaw. of Horbury, was maliciously set on fire, but was fortunately discovered in time to prevent its communicating to the barn. It is not known whether this was the act of a solitary incendiary, or a branch of that horrible system referred to in the preceding paragraph.</p>
</div>
<p>Such then, was the setting: marauders in search of guns. But for what purpose?</p>

<h2>The Folly Hall Fight<a class="headerlink" href="#the-folly-hall-fight" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>According to Philip Ahier in <em>The Legends and Traditions of Huddersfield and Its District</em>, <a class="reference external" href="https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/The_Legends_and_Traditions_of_Huddersfield_and_Its_District:_Volume_I,_Part_V_(1942)_by_Philip_Ahier">Volume I, Part V</a>, 1942, pp. 303, there are two likely origins for the name of Folly Hall, at the time, a three-story high building of four tenements built by the River Colne at the bottom of today’s Chapel Hill in Huddersfield: either, that it was a foolish place to build, because the river was known to flood there; or, because it was inconveniently situated away from the center of Huddersfield.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">How Folly Hall got it’s name</p>
<p>Philip Ahier, <em>The Legends and Traditions of Huddersfield and Its District</em>, <a class="reference external" href="https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/The_Legends_and_Traditions_of_Huddersfield_and_Its_District:_Volume_I,_Part_V_(1942)_by_Philip_Ahier">Volume I, Part V</a>, 1942, pp. 303.</p>
<p>2.—FOLLY HALL, CHAPEL HILL.</p>
<p>The original homestead was built for Marmaduke Hebden by “Blind Jack” Metcalf, of Knaresborough (the noted road builder of 18th century days) at some date during the last decades of that century.</p>
<p>It stood on the right hand bank of the River Colne, almost at the corner of the road leading over what is now known as Engine Bridge at the bottom of Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Why was the building termed Folly Hall?</p>
<p>There have been two theories formulated as to why it received this sobriquet:—</p>
<p>(a) In those days the River Colne frequently overflowed its banks (before dams and weirs were constructed) and it was considered foolishness on the part of any builder to erect a house in the immediate vicinity of the river as there was always a possibility that the rooms on the ground floor might get flooded. Hence the name Folly Hall was given to this homestead which had been built so close to the river. After the house had been flooded a few times, an earthen embankment was built to prevent further encroachment.</p>
<p>(b) Another version was given by Mr. John Hanson, of the Lead Works, Folly Hall, in an article entitled “Huddersfield Twenty Years Ago,” written for the defunct “Huddersfield Chronicle” or “The Huddersfield Weekly News” (June 1, 1878):</p>
<p>“The large building, three storeys high, comprising four tenements, was built by a person named Duke Nebden, (a corruption of Marmaduke Hebden). This place stood alone in the fields, and the people of Huddersfield considered it sheer stupidity to build so large a place in such an out of the way situation. They, therefore, called it Folly Hall, and from that the surrounding district got its name.”</p>
<p>It is quite possible that both the factors mentioned above, the proximity of the house to the river and its erection in a then secluded spot, gave the homestead its nickname.</p>
</div>
<p>Foolish it may have been to have built there, but how much more foolish was it to have met there on the night of Sunday, June 8th, and early hours of Monday, June 9th, 1817?</p>
<p>The following description identifies <em>two</em> tales that claim to describe the events that passed that night, demonstrating perhaps a part of the forgetting and re-membering process that underpins many a local legend or historical folk-tale.</p>

<p>Folly Hall is associated with the famous “Folly Hall Fight!” which took place on June 9, 1817. There are two entirely different versions of this “skirmish” which “took place at a time of great agitation” and unrest among the people of Huddersfield. The first was given by Mr. John Hanson in the article previously quoted <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[John</span> <span class="pre">Hansen,</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Lead</span> <span class="pre">Works,</span> <span class="pre">Folly</span> <span class="pre">Hall,</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">an</span> <span class="pre">article</span> <span class="pre">entitled</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Huddersfield</span> <span class="pre">Twenty</span> <span class="pre">Years</span> <span class="pre">Ago,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">written</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">defunct</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Huddersfield</span> <span class="pre">Chronicle&quot;</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">&quot;The</span> <span class="pre">Huddersfield</span> <span class="pre">Weekly</span> <span class="pre">News&quot;</span> <span class="pre">(June</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">1878)]</span></code>:</p>
<p>“This (an open field opposite a former primitive foundry) was the scene of the first famous Folly Hall Fight, where General Croft gave those notable words of command, ‘Front rank, kneel,down, rear rank, fire,’ which struck terror in the hearts of our brave yeomanry cavalry.”</p>
<p>“This ‘Folly Hall Fight’, as it was called, took place at a time of great agitation. In many places, the people were drilling and arming to fight for their rights and liberties. Croft was a brave old soldier who had fought in many a battle. He was drilling a squad of ‘rebels’ in the field by the River. The Yeomanry had been apprised of this and came down valiantly to disperse the ‘rebels.’ When they (the Yeomanry) reached the bridge they made a stand to reconnoitre. Just at that moment, the old veteran, in the course of his drill instructions, bawled out at the top of his voice, the the <em>(sic)</em> terrible words, ‘Front rank, kneel down! rear rank, fire.’ A few pistols went off, whereupon our valiant Bobadils took alarm, turned their horses sharp round and galloped up Chapel Hill as if they were riding a steeplechase. They ventured not to check their flight until they ran back to cover in the back yard of “The Rose and Crown.” (p. 228). Some sadly malicious people even said they wounded a horse in the nose with a pistol shot, to show what dangers they had braved, and the terrible jeopardy in which their valuable lives had been placed. In all probability, the malicious people who said so were not far wide of the mark. Thus ended the Folly Hall fight, where the vanquished fled without being attacked or even threatened) and the victors were wholly unaware of the brilliant repulse they had effected.”</p>
<p>The second version of the “Folly Hall Fight” is given by Mr. James Mayhall in his “Annals of Yorkshire” (Vol. 1., p. 263) under the year 1817:—</p>
<p>“On the 9th of June, some hundreds of persons assembled about midnight, at a place adjoining the town of Huddersfield, called Folly Hall Bridge, under a delusive expectation that they would be joined by other insurgents from various parts of the kingdom, and that, when united, their force would be sufficiently strong to overturn the government of the country! The approach of half a dozen yeomanry cavalry produced considerable alarm amongst them; but they mustered military ardour sufficient to fire several shots, and one of the cavalry horses was wounded in the head. The yeomanry, not considering it prudent to engage with so great a disparity of numbers, retreated for the purpose of obtaining a reinforcement, but before they could return to the field, a panic had seized the motley assembly at the bridge, and in a few minutes, their force was completely dispersed.”</p>
<p>“Four and twenty persons, charged with having in some way participated in this futile enterprise, were subsequently apprehended and committed to York Castle, and several others escaped. At the Assizes, in July, ten of the prisoners were put upon their trial before Baron Wood; part of them charged with stealing firearms on their way to the place of the rendezvous, and the remainder with aiding and abetting certain persons unknown, in firing at, with an intent to kill, maim, or disable Mr. David Alexander, the yeomanry cavalryman whose horse was shot in the head. Both the charges being ill—supported by evidence, all the prisoners put upon their trial were acquitted.”</p>

<p>Ahier cites one of his sources for the tale of the “Folly Hall Fight” as an article in the <em>“‘Huddersfield Chronicle’ or ‘The Huddersfield Weekly News’”</em>, although the actual reference appears to be the <em>Huddersfield and Holmfirth Examiner</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0003869/18780601/009/0009">Saturday 01 June 1878, p9</a>, also alternatively given as <a class="reference external" href="https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/Huddersfield_Examiner_(31/May/1878)"><em>Huddersfield Examiner (31/May/1878) - Huddersfield Seventy Years Ago: No. II</em></a> on the <a class="reference external" href="https://huddersfield.exposed/">Huddersfield Exposed</a> local history website.</p>
<p>A longer excerpt from the article provides some further colour about the affair, as well as an insight into the early water supply to the town in the 1850s.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>…</p>
<p>We had waterworks in Huddersfield but they were of a very primitive kind, as you will see. The source of our water supply was the river at Folly Hall or Engine Bridge. In a cottage near to Mr. Eastwood’s dyeworks was erected a forcing engine or pump. This was driven by a waterwheel and sent the turbid water up to Huddersfield. The main pipes that conveyed the water were large tree trunks, with a three and a half inch hole bored through them lengthways. They were tapered down at one end, and the bore at the other end widened a little to admit the tapering end, thus making what is called a faucet joint. These wooden pipes ran under the Canal, up the hill to the top of Outcote Bank, then along what was called the Upper Road to the higher part of the town, and finally discharged their water into a small reservoir which stood near Mr. Midgley’s warehouse. From this reservoir the town received its scanty supply. You may judge of the size of the mains from the following incident. It so happened that the supply to one part of the town was stopped, so that the inhabitants of that part were left “high and dry.” Much digging and searching was done to discover the obstruction, until at last the cause of the mischief was revealed. Imagine the astonishment of all when it was found that a large trout had stuck fast in one of the pipes. Connected with these waterworks was an old woman named Betty Earnshaw. She was rather a masculine looking woman, with a peculiarity about one of her eyes. She carried a large turn-key on her shoulder to turn on the water in the various parts of the town. The servant girls who had to rise early on washing mornings well knew how to get an early supply of water for their work. Betty also professed to tell fortunes for the silly lasses, so that what with water-turning and fortune-telling, old Betty managed to turn many an honest penny, and contrived to be never at a loss for a drop of “something good.” Whilst a lad I had to go to Lockwood for milk, as we had no milk hawkers in those days. As I passed Folly Hall I used to be attracted by the screeching and groaning of the old pumping engine. It sounded as if it had not had a drop of oil for twelve months or more. I would peep in through the broken window and watch the crazy thing at work. It would make a desperate effort, stand for a few seconds and then groaningly move off again. Thus painfully and laboriously was the scanty supply of water pumped up from the polluted river. A little further on, at Folly Hall, my eye caught sight of the blaze of a furnace. I crossed the road and looked into a cottage through the place where a pane of glass had been. There I saw an old woman hard at work breaking up the pigs of iron with a heavy sledge hammer. After she had thus broken it, she put the pieces upon her head, carried them up some steps, and threw them into the furnace. Those who have been engaged in this hard hot work of furnace-tending, and those who have seen the swarthy grimy toilers toiling and perspiring at their work may imagine whether or not that old woman fairly earned her bread. Another time I went behind the cottage, and there saw a horse trotting round in a gin which worked a large pair of blacksmith’s bellows, used to melt down the iron in the furnace. They had no other method at that day, as it was before the invention of the fan or rotary bellows. I have every reason to believe that this was the first iron foundry in Huddersfield or neighbourhood. I never knew or heard tell of one before this one. It was established by two partners, Messrs. Holmes and Prince. They carried on business for some time and might have done very well. Prince, the experienced partner, left the firm; Holmes, who had previously been coachman to Colonel Smithson, knew nothing of the business. By careless and intemperate habits he allowed the business to fall away, and he himself finally became a bailiff. The next iron foundry was that started by Jonathan Brook, at the bottom of Outcote Bank, and after that came the foundry of Mills at Aspley. The site on which the little foundry at Folly Hall stood has seen several changes. The foundry was succeeded by a brewery; the brewery by soapworks; these by leadworks; after that by iron-works again; and in 1833 the late George Smith established a spirit store and dram shop on the ground where one of the little cottages once stood.</p>
<p>From this primitive foundry right on to the river side was an open field. This was the scene of the first famous Folly Hall fight, where General Croft gave those notable words of command “Front rank, kneel down, rear rank, fire!” which struck terror into the hearts of our brave yeomanry cavalry. This “Folly Hall fight,” as it was called, took place at a time of great public agitation. In many places the people were drilling and arming to fight for their rights and liberty. Croft was a brave old soldier who had fought in many a battle. He was drilling a squad of “rebels” in the field by the river. The yeomanry had been apprised of this and came down valiantly to disperse the “rebels.” When they reached the bridge they made a stand to reconnoitre. Just at that moment the old veteran in the course of his drill instructions, bawled out at the top of his voice the terrible words “Front rank, kneel down, rear rank, fire!” A few pistols went off, whereupon our valiant Bobadils took alarm, turned their horses sharp round and galloped up Chapel Hill as if they were riding a steeplechase. They ventured not to check their flight until they ran to cover in the back yard of the Rose and Crown. Some sadly malicious people even said they wounded a horse in the nose with a pistol-shot, to shew what dangers they had braved, and the terrible jeopardy in which their valuable lives had been placed. In all probability the malicious people who said so were not far wide of the mark. Thus ended the Folly Hall fight, where the vanquished fled without being attacked or even threatened, and the victors were wholly unaware of the brilliant repulse they had affected.
…
I can well recollect the time when our streets were all in darkness. People went about at night with hand glass lanterns, and our shops were lighted up with candles or muddy oil lamps. It was then so decreed by our authorities that our main streets should be lighted up. For this purpose lamp-posts were put down at wide intervals. These were furnished with glasses something like an inverted beehive. In them were placed oil lamps which gave a dim uncertain light, and served only to make darkness visible. By eleven or twelve o’clock they were usually nearly all “winked up.” Gas was not known at that day as an illuminator. The first gas used in Huddersfield was made by Wm. Waite, a plumber and glazier. His shop was next door to the Globe Inn. His gas apparatus was in the back workshop, and from there he lighted up his front shop window. This new light in the district created great wonder. The shop front was surrounded nightly by a crowd of gaping spectators, who marvelled greatly how anyone could set fire to the end of a cold lead pipe. The first inn in Huddersfield in which gas was burnt was the White Lion, in Cross Church Street. Mr. Waite made a large leathern bag something like a round bellows, and took it to the inn filled with gas, placed it under the table in which a hole was bored to admit a pipe that stood about six inches above the table. There the gas was ignited and consumed, to the great astonishment of the jovial, though perhaps not specially intelligent, frequenters of the house.</p>

<p>Second Edition</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Huddersfield was thrown into consternation on Sunday night, by an attack made about 12 o’clock, on six of the horse-patrole, at Folly-Hall Bridge, near that place, by a number of men with arms. A volley was fired, and one of the horses struck on the head, by a ball, which has since been extracted. The patrole finding their number too small to attack their adversaries, retired after a shot had been fired by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was wounded; and by the time the main body with the infantry reached the place, the whole of the assailants had dispersed.</p>
</div>
<p>The events at Folly Hall were also remarked upon as part of a longer article describing other insurrectionary events of the previous weekend at Thornhill Lees. Another incident, near Ossett, on the same evening as the events at Folly Hall, was also mentioned in passing.</p>

<p>PROJECTED INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>We regret, however, to state, that an attempt was made in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to assassinate one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, about one o’clock on Monday morning, by firing a loaded pistol, the ball of which lodged in the forehead of the horse belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Huddersfield, but the ball has been extracted, and the horse is likely to recover. We understand that an outrage of a similar nature was committed the same night, at Ossett, a village near Dewsbury, … Five persons have been apprehended at Huddersfield, and its neighbourhood, on a charge of being concerned in the former of these daring outrages.— They have since been committed to York Castle, on a charge of malicious firing: they passed through this place yesterday afternoon, accompanied by an escort of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry.</p>
<p>The following is a list of their names and residence:</p>
<p>Abram Oldham, and John Oldham, of Honley.<br />
Isaac Johnson, and Joshua Knowles, of Holmfirth.<br />

<p class="admonition-title">The state affairs in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, July 1817</p>
<p>London Courier and Evening Gazette, <a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001476/18170716/004/0002">Wednesday 16 July 1817</a></p>
<p>We copy the following article from the <em>Leeds Intelligencer</em> of Monday, received this morning:—</p>
<p>“The state affairs in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield has been much more serious than we imagined, and there is still some ground of alarm, for the further probable progress of the disaffected in that quarter; Twenty-three prisoners, in all, have been sent to York Castle, some of them charged with high-treason, others with rioting, stealing arms, &amp; c. Eighteen still remain in custody at Huddersfield, of whom four, and fifth since discharged, were apprehended on Tuesday night last, namely, <em>John Spencer</em>, Cleckheaton; <em>Edward Fletcher</em>, cardmaker, Hightown; <em>Benjamin Heptonstall</em>, cloth-dresser, Hightown <em>James Clegg</em>, of Hightown; and <em>————— Sampson</em>, Robert-Town, who is discharged. Besides these, about 50 men, against whom there are informations far having been concerned in the late outrages, have absconded; but they are diligently looked for by the civil authorities, and hopes are entertained that many of them will yet be apprehended. One of these fellows formerly resided in Leeds, which he was forced to quit. This precious <em>Reformer</em> of the State was, it appears, to have been Lieutenant-General of that insurrectionary army, which the disaffected hoped would have existed in great force on the day fixed for the general rising. His late residence is close to Folly-hall Bridge <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[the</span> <span class="pre">reference</span> <span class="pre">is,</span> <span class="pre">perhaps,</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">George</span> <span class="pre">Dawson?]</span></code>, at which the small party of Yeomanry under Capt. ARMYTAGE were attacked by the insurgents; and the deserted house now bears the mark of having been struck by a ball from the fire of the infatuated madmen w|io were marching to their own destruction and that of their country.</p>
<p>“The information previously obtained saved Huddersfield that night from the most horrible fate. The band which was met at Folly-Hall-bridge constituted only one part of the numerous insurgents, whose plan was to have attacked the town simultaneously and by surprise. In the hope that the Magistracy would have intimation of their approach, the night of attack was changed from that of Monday the 9th to Sunday the 8th of June.— Marching silently and rapidly to the execution of their plan, the military were to have been suddenly secured and their arms taken by the insurgents; while the Magistrates were to have been seized, kept as hostages, and compelled to use their authority in favour of the insurrection. Several individuals were marked out for massacre, and the daring ruffians who were engaged in these outrageous proceedings entertained confident hopes that the town would have been in their undisputed possession before morning. Plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent, no doubt, would have succeeded the authority of the Magistracy and the rule of the laws.</p>
<p>“Most fortunately, intelligence had been obtained of the meditated attack. The Civil and Military Authorities were on the alert. The spirited corps of yeomanry, as well as the regular troops, were under arms. The town was in a complete state of preparation for defence and encounter with the insurgents, at Folly-Hall-bridge, by convincing them their plan was detected, frustrated, for the present, their enterprize and their hopes. Many of the inhabitants heard the firing, the alarm of the bugle, the galloping of the cavalry through the streets, and awaited, in breathless anxiety, the result.</p>
<p>“A master shoemaker, of Huddersfield, in respectable credit, and flourishing business, is another of the persons who have absconded. He has been seen in Hamburgh since his flight; and, it is to be hoped, will repent him, in his wretched exile, of the courses which have compelled him to fly from those blessings in this county which he was unworthy to enjoy.</p>
<p>“In our last we announced the apprehension of a man at Huddersfield, on Friday the 4th instant, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State. He turns out to be one of the Thornhill Lees Delegates, <em>Benjamin Whiteley</em>, of Holmfirth, clothdrawer; and has been in the regular receipt for the labour of himself and his wife, of not less than <em>four pounds per week!!!</em>. He is committed to Salisbury prison.</p>
<p>“One of the chief Conspirators, now in gaol, warily avoided engaging personally in the outrages. He, however, assisted actively at all the meetings for arranging the plan; and has been impeached since the apprehension of some of his accomplices. On being taken up himself, he said, he had for many years kept the Law and the Government at defiance and now he was betrayed to destruction by a set of his own blockheads at last! While he was in custody of the Constables who were charged to convey him, escorted by cavalry, to York Castle, he was placed in an upper room, till the horses were ready; he had seized the opportunity to attempt self-destruction, and the Constables cut him down after he had actually suspended himself from a bedstead in the apartment!</p>
<p>“On the accuracy of the preceding particulars the public may rely; as we have carefully examined into the truth of the facts, during the past week, on the spot. While there has been so much falsehood and misrepresentation palmed upon the country, we have much pleasure in being also able to state, that after making the most diligent inquiry at Huddersfield, we cannot find that any one of the numerous persons apprehended has pretended to charge Oliver, or any other individual, with having seduced or entrapped him. Not one, indeed, as far as we can learn, appears to have even had any knowledge of Oliver’s visit to this district.</p>
<p>“The spirited and highly respectable corps of Huddersfield Yeomanry (100 strong) are above all praise, for their late and present patriotic exertions.”</p>

<p>The spirited and highly respectable Corps of Huddersfield Volunteers, (100 strong) are above all praise, for their late and present patriotic exertions. To them may be attributed, in a great measure, the safety of that town, and perhaps of the surrounding country, to a great extent, from the most fearful state of outrage. They muster with an alacrity that does them honour, by day or by night, and are even yet, in occasional parties, employed in searching the country at nights, for the insurgents who have absconded.— Huddersfield is now committed to their protection, with that of two companies of the 33d foot, and they have evinced a degree of activity and zeal that must make their townsmen feel as one as to the defence of their property and persons, from the turbulent disciples of those fantastic, dangerous, and wicked doctrines, which have already more than once endangered the tranquility of the whole Kingdom.</p>

<p>The <em>Carlisle Patriot</em>  of <a class="reference external" href="https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000365/18170719/003/0003">Saturday 19 July 1817</a> also included the opening fragment of the <em>Leeds Intelligencer</em> report, as well as the following remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Gazette of last night contains Royal Proclamation, pardoning all individuals who have been guilty of frame-breaking, and who shall, before the first day September next, appear before some Justice of the Peace and declare when and where their offence was committed. This Proclamation, combined with the Act which has lately passed the Legislature, for the more severe punishment of those who shall henceforward guilty outrages, will, we trust, put speedy end practices not less disgraceful the public character than they are dangerous the public tranquillity.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Unlike 1812, when machine breaking was common around Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as well as Huddersfield, this proclamation perhaps reflects the continued frame-breaking activity in those other counties and that, once again, is another story for another day.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Leeds Mercury</em>, which had been running a whole series of stories about “the spy, Oliver” over this period, took a calmer and more considered view than the <em>Leeds Intelligencer</em> in a report that also makes mention of Oliver’s visits to Huddersfield:</p>

<p>THE HUDDERSFIELD INSURRECTION</p>
<p>An inflated and highly exaggerated account of the state of the town and neighbourhood of Huddersfield, during the past month, has been published in the Leeds Intelligencer, and copied into the London Ministerial papers. Such a publication, on the eve of the trial at York, we hold to be extremely reprehensible, and must, as far as it is believed, have a tendency to prejudice the minds of the jury appointed to sit in judgement upon the lives of the accused. To assert in a public print before the trials come on, and of course on <em>ex parte</em> evidence, that the object of the prisoners was “massacre,” and that their plans were to be consummated by “plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent,” is to prejudge their cause, and to deprive these unfortunate men of the benefit of that salutary maxim of the English law, which holds every man to be innocent till a jury of his countrymen has pronounced him guilty. Without pretending to be at all in the secrets of the insurgents, we must say, we have too favourable an opinion of our species and of our countrymen, to believe that any numerous body of them in a particular neighbourhood, could be brought to be the actors in a sedition, that was to inflict “massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage,” upon their neighbours, “to a fearful extent.” The intention of the insurgents, as far as we can learn, was to effect a “bloodless revolution,” and the purpose of seizing and <em>disarming</em> the military, as stated is the account before us, seems to favour that supposition. That a bloodless revolution could have been effected, is, to be sure, a supposition too gross to be entertained by any set of men of common understanding; but Mr. Oliver, it seems, had the address to persuade the leaders that a project of this kind was practicable, and his dupes were so utterly ignorant as to adopt the absurdity. This fact may serve to shew of what kind of materials the Huddersfield branch of the conspiracy was formed. How many men and boys (for there was, it seems, a considerable proportion of the latter) assembled at <em>Folly</em>-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th, we cannot learn with any degree of certainty, but some estimate may be formed of their strength from the fact, that a detachment of newly-raised Yeomanry Cavalry put to flight and entirely dispersed the insurgent army! while the only blood that flowed on the occasion on either side, was the blood of a horse, and the only other mark of violence inflicted was, as the Intelligencer states, the mark of a bail which struck a deserted house! We do not wish to speak with levity of a proceeding which every friend to his country must condemn, but when we see a local act of popular violence, exaggerated to the bulk of a wide spreading insurrection, we feel it to be our duty to remove the deception, by lowering down the colouring to the standard of truth.</p>
<p>We have hitherto cautiously abstained from entering into the details of the violent proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield on the night of the 8th of June, satisfying ourselves with stating from time to time the committals of the prisoners to the County gaol; and this course we should have pursued, leaving the facts to be developed upon the trials, had not the exaggerated statements made in the Intelligencer induced us to depart from that determination. It now, however, becomes proper to state, that ever since the year 1812, when the Luddite system prevailed in Yorkshire, and raged more especially in the South-western plots of this Riding, there has been considerable irritation existing in the minds of some of the lower classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. This disposition, the extreme distress suffered by the labouring part of the community during the past year, tended materially to increase. For a time, the hope of Parliamentary Reform allayed the public dissatisfaction, by affording some prospect of relief, and petitions for that purpose were drawn up and signed very generally; but no sooner was the Bill for the suspension of the <em>Habeas Corpus</em> Act passed into a law, then hope gave place to despair; and soon after, a number of designing men, seizing the opportunity, did not hesitate to inculcate the opinion, that nothing short of a revolution could terminate the general suffering. Of these pestilent characters, the notorious Mr. Oliver was one of the principal; and we have the authority of the wife of one of the persons mentioned in the Intelligencer as a principal conspirator (George Dawson <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[the</span> <span class="pre">perpetrator</span> <span class="pre">whose</span> <span class="pre">house</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">close</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">bridge]</span></code>), delivered in the presence of three respectable witnesses, for saying that as long since as nearly two months ago, Oliver was in communication with the ring-leaders of the sedition, and that on one occasion he was a visitor at Dawson’s house. On the same authority we state, that Mr. Oliver had held conferences with George Taylor, the leader of the mal-content forces, on the night of the 8th of June, and it is known that both Dawson and Taylor have since absconded. How Oliver conducted himself in his visits to Huddersfield, may be collected from the testimony of Dawson’s wife, who says, that one morning, while she was at breakfast at Dawson’s house, Oliver, among other inflammatory conversation, said -“They are all in readiness, in London. There is no occasion for bloodshed. We have only to seize the military and disarm them, and the thing is done.” He added, that he had been concerned with Despard; that just before the Colonel and his associates were apprehended, he was going into a private room with them, but recollecting that he had a little business of his own to transact, he stepped out. and had not been gone half an hour, before they were all taken.</p>
<p>Under this kind of excitation, it is no wonder that the persons to whom such conversation was addressed, began to form traitorous designs, or rather perhaps, to cherish hopes that designs already formed might be realized. The leaders, it appears, held frequent communications with the subordinate agents. The plot thickened daily. A considerable number of men in the lowest ranks of life became involved in the conspiracy. Sunday night, the 8th of June, was appointed for the rising. Two or three hundred persons, it is said, many of them boys from 14 to 20 years, assembled at a place bearing the appropriate name of <em>Folly</em>-hall-bridge. Taylor placed himself at their head, and at 12 o’clock, the moment for commencing operations, this fanatic addressed his followers in these terms “Now, my lads, all England is in arms-our liberties are secure— the rich will be poor, and the poor will be rich.” To this rabble a detachment of six Yeomanry Cavalry was at first opposed, and we verily believe that had the cavalry, small as their number were, thought proper to advance, they would have routed the insurgents, They however judged it prudent to retreat, and being reinforced by a body of their comrades, they returned to witness the dispersion of an unorganized mob that had been drawn together, some by actual force, others by an idle curiosity, and others, no doubt, with criminal designs. In the mean time, a sort of under-plot was acting, and a number of marauders were passing about the neighbourhood, forcing the peaceable inhabitants to open their doors and surrender their fire-arms. At Honley, they broke into the house of Mr. Armitage, who observed that one of the bandits seemed better dressed than his associates,that he was not like one of this country-men, and that he talked like a Londoner.”</p>
<p>The Magistrates, who appear to have displayed a more than ordinary share of vigour, soon found means to discover and to arrest a number of the persons engaged in these criminal excesses, and twenty-four of them have been committed to York Castle, to take their trials at the Assizes, which commence this day, while about half that number still remain in confinement in the prison at Huddersfield. It is much to be regretted that the persons apprehended, and about to be put upon their trials, have for the most part, been, at most, merely the dupes of the leaders of this miserable conspiracy, and that the instigators, including Mr. Oliver, the London delegate, have been suffered to escape.</p>

<p>With respect to his absconding, it seems that George Dawson made it to America, but he was not to enjoy his freedom there for long:</p>

Carlisle Patriot - Saturday 02 August 1817</p>
<p>YORK LAMMAS ASSIZES.</p>
<p>These Assizes commenced at the Castle in York on Monday the 21st July. Mr. Baron Wood presided in the criminal Court. Tine following is his charge to the Grand Jury.</p>
<p>“*Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,—I am sorry to observe, there are a larger number prisoners than has been usual at the Summer Assizes, and particularly concerned to find that the number is increased by no less than twenty-four persons from the Western part of this county, charged with committing grievous riots, and of being concerned in tumultuary outrages. I was in hopes that the examples made in this place, a few years ago, would have made such an impression upon the minds of these people, as would have deterred them from engaging in future in any similar acts of outrage. I am sorry that they have not produced this effect, and that this disposition to outrage does not seem have been repressed.</p>
<p>“The first prisoner in the Calendar, charged with being present in these tumultuary assemblages, is also charged with feloniously holding, presenting and levelling a gun, with intent to kill or do some grievous bodily harm. This offence, as at present described, is only a misdemeanor, and not a felony, and I make this observation, because, from the use of the word feloniously, it seems have been the intention to charge it as a capital offence under Lord Ellenborough’s act; but in order to constitute this offence, there should be, in addition to the levelling and presenting the gun, the further act either of firing at, or of pulling the trigger with such intention, and thereby to kill or do grievous bodily harm to some of his Majesty’s subjects. The offence, it stands, is only misdemeanor, though a misdemeanor attended with very aggravating circumstances. There are others charged with stealing fire-arms, and the stealing of arms by force is undoubtedly a felony, and a most enormous offence, and bills of felony will be presented to you against these persons. With respect to the persons charged generally with being concerned in these tumultuary assemblages, it seems to me that their offence will amount only to a misdeameanor more or less aggravated; what their precise or ultimate object was, does not appear from any evidence before the Court— that it was in the highest degree illegal can admit of no doubt, and it is deeply to be lamented that any persons should be so infatuated and deluded as to engage in tumultuary proceedings of this description. It is true they may produce much present mischief, but Justice will certainly overtake the parties who engage in them, and their schemes will issue only in their own misery and ruin, if not death. It is unquestionably the duty of every good subject, and more especially of the magistracy, to exert themselves to the utmost in the suppression of these dangerous outrages, and in the detection and apprehension of the persons who engage in them that they may be brought to condign punishment.</p>
<p>TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS</p>
<p>Friday July 25— <em>Joseph Sykes</em>, of Honley, clothier; <em>Isaac Johnson</em>, late of Holmfirth; <em>Joshua Thewlis</em>, late of Holmfirth; <em>Abraham Oldham</em>, of Marsh Plat, in Honley; <em>John Oldham</em>, of Marsh Plat, in Honley; and <em>Benjamin Donkersly</em>, of Honley, weaver; were arraigned, for that they, together with <em>George Taylor</em>, and <em>Benjamin Shaw</em>, (not yet taken) and other persons to the Jury unknown:— Did about twelve in the night of the of the 8th  of June last, burglariously break into the dwelling-house of Clement Dyson, of Honley aforesaid, and feloniously steal, take, and carry away therefrom, one gun, value 40s. from the person of Mrs. Dyson; putting her in fear—There were several counts, charging the crime in different ways.—To this indictment the prisoners severally pleaded <em>Not Guilty</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping stated, that it was a capital offence burglariously to enter into a dwelling-house and stealing therefrom. The prisoners who stood before the Jury, wore indicted for burglariously entering a dwelling-house at and stealing therefrom a gun. He would state at the outset, that this prosecution was carried on by Government. He felt, and he was sure the Jury, and all good men must agree in feeling, that this was a case of such a nature, that the government would have deserted the interest of the country, if it had not submitted it to the decision of a Jury. The crime attacking the houses of individuals;—breaking-in; demanding arms; and this done by numbers, to the amount one, two, or three or four and twenty, demands imperiously the interference of Government for the protection of peaceable subjects. He, for his part, felt pity for those who were so minded to suppose that such numbers of people, collected, at that time night, and so acting, did not call upon any Government, who attended to the interests of the people they governed, to protect private property front outrage, and the law from infringement. If such outrageous proceedings, in the dead of Sunday night—getting arms—were not circumstances that called for interference, he for his part did not know what circumstance could call for interference. It did not, however, follow, that, because this is a prosecution from Government, the Jury were to find the prisoners guilty without evidence. God forbid! The Jury would listen to the case as if it were brought at the instance of any private individual. God forbid that any Government should institute a trial which was not so meant to be heard, or that a Government should find persons willing to conduct it. “If the facts are proved before you, Gentlemen, you will have this question to decide, whether the Law or the Criminals shall yield. I know I am addressing myself to men of integrity, who will acquit the prisoner if the facts are not proved; who will have firmness enough to give their verdict against them if they are satisfied of their guilt.”</p>
<p>Mrs. <em>Hannah Dyson</em> called—She stated,—I am the of wife Clement Dyson; and live at Honley, about three miles from Huddersfield. I went to bed somewhere about nine o’clock that evening. I locked and barred the house door; we have only one door. While in bed asleep, perhaps two hours after I had gone to bed, I was awoke by a great noise, as of a company of men coming to the door, and knocking. They called out, your firelock immediately. I said I had lent it; but they replied, we know better than that— you have the firelock and we must have it immediately. They were outside at this time; and continued knocking— I then said, “Jane, where is the gun?” to one of my little daughters—she said, in the garret. I called to the men, will you pray be quiet and go home, my husband’s not at home. They answered, we do not want your husband, we want your gun. They kept knocking on, and said, if you do not fetch it, and open the door, we will break the door all to pieces, and they kept knocking on. Then I went for the gun to the garret; and while I was fetching it down, they kept knocking on, and broke open the door, just as I was coming down. The bar and lock were both broken off the door. They met me at the bottom of the steps, and I gave them the gun, which was my husband’s. The person that took the gun came a little in; but I did not know him, as it was dark just there, within the door. They said, thank you mistress, when I gave them the gun, and went away. I opened the door, just as I could see and said, “You are a set of Ludding rogues; and will never be quiet till you all be hung in a band.” One of them said, “Turn again and blow a ball through her.” I said, “<em>Fell</em> dare you?”— I saw the men standing in three rows. I think there were about 7 in the front row. I cannot say how many were in the other ranks. I saw Joseph Sykes going up the steps into the road. My house is lower down than the road; the steps are about 4 yards from house.—Joseph Sykes had a waistcoat on, wrong side out. I cannot say whether he had on a coat; but I just saw the pockets of the waistcoat wrong side out. I knew Sykes a little before. He lives about a quarter of a mile from my house. I do not know what trade he is. I am sure he is the man. I really thought he was the man. I have no doubt he is the man. I saw him next morning between 8 and 9, just up above my door. He said, have you had the men at your door last night?— I said, you was like to know when you was one of them. He turned his back, and went as white as a clout when I told him, and went away. I cannot say I see any of the other men here. There was Benjamin Donkersley, but I do not see him here. [<em>On looking round more attentively, however, and being desired to point him out, the witness fixed upon Donkersley, at the farther end of the bar.</em>] I am sure he was there. He stood near my door, he was one of the first row, I think. I had seen him before that evening between nine and ten. He was in a little field before our house, making a motion as if he had a gun in his hand; but he had nothing in his hand. There was another man with him, who was doing nothing but watching him. The other man had nothing in his hand. They went away when they saw me. I do not know the value of the gun. My husband did not buy it. He had it given him last Ludtime, at Chester. It was a good gun. It had a gold touch hole. It was complete; and this man (pointing to the prisoner Sykes) knows that; for he let it off three or four days before at my door. It might be worth 30s. I say that value, though I do not know.</p>
<p>On her cross-examination she said she was as glad to give the gun as they were to take it, because she was afraid of their threats. It was quite dark in the house, and it was dark where the man stood who took the gun. He could not take it without putting his foot forward. She knew both Sykes and Robinson. This witness’s examination occupied three hours.</p>
<p><em>Samuel Wimpenny</em> sworn—I know Isaac Johnson.—I saw him in June last, the night of Sunday the 8th, I saw him at the bottom of Sow Lane, about ten.—He was going to a meeting at the Banks. He said I must go and get myself ready, and meet him at the bottom of the lane. Jonathan Fellas was with me, Joshua Thewlis stood in the lane, a little beyond Isaac Johnson. It was Thewlis, the prisoner, (pointing him out.) Fellas went to his house, and I went to mine, a little higher the lane. I have served my apprenticeship with his father. I had got my supper, and was doffing to go to bed; for I had determined on not going to the meeting, when Isaac Johnson came to see if I was ready, I said I should not like to go. He said Joshua Thewlis and t’other were waiting at the bottom of the lane. He said if I did not go, it would be life and death. He said Richard Haigh had said it would be life and death if they did not go; for they would be safer there than at home. Haigh lives at the bridge, near Holmfirth. I then yielded that I would as far as Far End and look at them. I had been wet, and put on dry stockings. As he went out, he said he would go and see where the others were. Jonathan Fellas then came, and wished to know if I had gotten ready. Thewlis was at the door, and told us Johnson had gone to call Cockin, and John Donkersley. We went to Far End with Thewlis. There were several persons there. I knew none them but Isaac Johnson, John Donkersley, Joshua Thewlis, Joseph Cockin, Jonathan Fellas, and Joseph Beaumont. There were 30 or 40 men, as I can reckon, and I saw six or seven with guns and pistols. When I got amongst them, they were all in confusion. Some were for one thing—some for another—some for going into Honley—some for going home. One said he would make them all fall into ranks, and march to Hinley. Far End may be about a quarter of mile from Honley.—They fell into ranks. The armed men marched first, the rest followed in rows, two deep. I do not know the name of the first place we went to. It is a little house, down in a close, about the Bank. I have learned since it was Wm. Heelis’s. We demanded arms. We went to Clement Dyson’s in a body. They demanded arms, I not know who spoke. They refused to open the door. I then heard Isaac Johnson say, “Damn it—knock it open.” They were all standing cluthered about the steps. I was standing at the back side, at the top of the road. Johnson was one of them. Some of them knocked at the door. I heard Thewlis also say, Damn it—knock it open. They knocked pretty loudly; but I do not know whether they knocked it open, as it opened from within. I was about 8 yards from them. The door opened, and they demanded arms. I did not see them get a gun. But as I was coming back, I heard one of them say they had got a gun or pistol, which he said he had seen the woman give them. I left them soon after. Next day I saw Johnson with Fellas, I asked him how they had gone on, and how far they went. He said they went to several other places and demanded arms. He charged me and Fellas to tell nobody what we had seen that night, for if we did, they would hang us. I saw Thewlis and Fellas on Wednesday night after.— Thewlis charged me to say nothing if I was taken up. I have not seen Fellas since. He has run.</p>
<p>Cross-examined, he said, he knew nothing of the meeting, and should not have went had he not been frightened into it by Johnson’s speech. No favour was held out to him for giving his evidence; he has been custody ever since.</p>
<p><em>Joshua Kemp</em> sworn.—I live at Honley. I was out in the evening of June 8. I first saw Uriah Butterworth between 10 and 11, in Thurston, near Honley. I was going home to bed when I met him. He told me if I would go to Honley-bridge I should see many hundred people, as something was to be done that night at Huddersfield. I went to Honley-bridge, and saw the two Oldhams— none others of the prisoners Were there. There were half a score of them at that time. Honley bar is on the bridge. We went altogether to Far End, near Honley. We were to meet the Holmfirth people there. There might be between 20 and 30 there. The Holmfirth people said they would not go to Huddersfield without arms; and Geo. Taylor proposed they should and collect arms at Honley, they should first go to Godfrey Sanderson’s. The two Oldhams were there; and, (pointing to Johnson) this man. Abraham Oldham was armed when we came to the bridge with a gun. He took with him. None of the others that came from Honley Bar were armed. I was one of the party at Clement Dyson’s house. I know Clement Dyson. They went to the door, knocked, and cried for arms. I was about 10 yards from the door with the two Oldhams. They knocked and called for arms. I heard two say, knock it open but I do not know who they were. Mrs. Dyson came to the door, and I went down to the wall side, about 5 yards from her. I do not know who got the gun. He put his foot and hand forward to receive it, inside the door. I cannot recollect seeing Johnson there. The gun was carried away.</p>
<p>Cross-examined—I never saw Johnson before that night. I cannot pretend to say he was at Dyson’s, as I did not see him. I know him now. Mrs. D. was inside the door when she gave the gun.</p>
<p><em>Susan Hurst</em> sworn—I live in Honley. I know Sykes. He next door neighbour. I recollect what happened on the night Sunday June 8—I heard that night a gentle rape at Sykes’s door, about 12 o’clock. I heard one person say to another, Step forward David my lad; we’ll have no nonsense at Berrycroft’s-hill tonight. I heard footsteps come down Sykes’s stairs.— Between five and six o’clock in the morning Sykes was in my house. I asked him what made him so long coming down after that gentle rap. He said he could neither find his holiday breeches, nor his every-day breeches, and that he had put on his waistcoat wrong side out in his hurry. He said he was vary sickly and faint, and that he had had no sleep.</p>
<p>Cross-examined—I have lived four years next door to Sykes. He has a wife and three small children, the youngest about two months, the oldest about 5 years—I cannot be positive that he came down, only from his own words.</p>
<p><em>Kemp</em>, called again by prisoner’s counsel—I remained with them till the last. I went to the bottom of Taylor Hill. I left them there about two in the morning. The party went to Sykes’s after we had been at.Dyson’s. They went to his door, it was to get his gun. The crowd said, neither Joseph nor his gun are in the house.</p>
<p>The examinations of the prisoners, in which various acts outrage were detailed; and in one of which the object of the insurgents was stated to be Revolution, were then put in and read.</p>
<p>Several witnesses were called prove that had told various stories relative to these transactions, and had repeatedly said, in their hearing, that she not know one of the persons who came to the house. They also gave the prisoners a good character—these persons were acquaintances the prisoners.</p>
<p>The Counsel for the prosecution wished the examinations before the Magistrates put in, but the Judge would not receive them. The Counsel for the prisoners insisted that not one them had been identified. The Jury turned round in the box, and in two minutes pronounced their verdict, finding all the prisoners, <em>Not Guilty</em>.</p>
<p>Saturday July 26— <em>Benjamin Lockwood</em>, of Salford; <em>George Woffenden</em>, <em>John Wilson</em>, and <em>Joseph Jysop</em>, were put to the bar, charged with having on the 8th of June last, at Huddersfield, together with certain other persons not yet in custody, been present, aiding, and assisting, to a person unknown, in shooting a loaded gun at David Alexander, with intent to kill and murder the said David Alexander. Other counts charged the prisoners with intent to wound, lame, maim, or to do some grievous bodily harm to Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson opened the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping stated to the Jury, that the four prisoners the bar, as his learned friend had just stated, stood indicted, for having, in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, been concerned in maliciously aiding, counselling, and assisting some persons unknown, either to kill or maim a person of the name of Alexander, on the night of the 8th of June last. The learned Counsel said that the circumstances of the case, which he would shortly state, were of such a character, that had no doubt that the Jury would concur with him in thinking they ought made the subject of public discussion. They were, indeed, such as well deserved examination. It would have been disgraceful to any country, governed by law, if such proceedings had been suffered to pass unnoticed. It would be for the Jury to say, whether the prisoners at the bar, or any of them, were the parties engaged in them. Some of the present Jury, perhaps, were the Jury of yesterday. With the decision of that Jury he respectfully acquiesced. The object of that charge was to prove attack on the house of an individual for the purpose of stealing arms. The business of this day will lead to the use which was made of the arms when obtained. On Sunday, the 8th of June last, a number of persons had met together, at or near Huddersfieid, between twelve and one o’clock. The four prisoners at the bar were amongst a party of insurgents, who fired a loaded gun at Mr. Alexander; and now stand charged with being present and assisting at that outrage. The question the jury had to decide upon was, whether the prisoners, or any of them, were present, and giving countenance to the person who fired this shot, and struck the horse of Mr. Alexander; for, if they were so present, they were equally guilty, (as the learned Judge would tell them) as the person who actually fired it; and they were equally guilty, whether they fired at Mr. Alexander In particular, the party generally with whom he was. The law and justice of the country would made a mockery and a laughing stock if this were not the case, and if every individual of criminal and unlawful assembly were not held responsible for the criminal acts of the others. It might be attempted to be proved by the Counsel for the prisoners (as was done yesterday) that the witness whom he would call, Armitage, was an accomplice. He was, however, going peaceably to his own home; and was compelled to be an eye-witness of the proceedings. There was no pretence for calling him an accomplice; but supposing he was an accomplice, no one at this time of day would venture to call in question the competency of such a witness. Unless the law, indeed, had wisely suffered the testimony of accomplices to be given, it would have been often impossible to convict persons of crimes of great public importance. But if the case rested upon the evidence of an accomplice only, it was certainly the duty of a jury to pause and hesitate before they found a prisoner guilty. A Jury, it is true, had before now, under the direction of as learned and upright a Judge as ever sat upon a bench, convicted a criminal upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice, But he (Mr. Topping) did not call upon the Jury for that. In the first place, his witness was <em>no accomplice</em>; and secondly he would be <em>confirmed</em>. The prisoner, Lockwood, was a prime mover in this business. He was the man who pressed Taylor into the service. But he would not recapitulate the facts. The inquiry was of infinite public importance. It was of importance that the persons guilty of this offence should be punished. It was of importance to inquire, whether they were guilty or innocent. The inquiry was necessary for public justice—necessary for public peace—and if the prisoners were guilty, necessary for public example. If the Jury, however, had any suspicion of the evidence, God forbid they should find the prisoners guilty upon it.</p>
<p><em>Capt. Armytage</em> sworn. I commanded the Yeomanry at Huddersfield, on the 8th of June.— We were then on duty. I had some information, and went out to the Bridge, myself, with six of the cavalry and a constable, named Whitehead—we went on horseback. I put David Alexander, one of the cavalry, about 50 yards in advance. His horse is a whitish grey one. The Engine Bridge (also called Folly-hall-bridge) is about a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield. Shires (another of the yeomanry,) and Alexander were in front, at the bridge. The constable was with me, and the other four —my party was about 50 yards from Shires and Alexander. It is usual, in going out to patrole, to have an advanced guard. At the bridge, I almost lost sight of them, being rather dark. We had scarcely moved into a trot, to come up with them, when some one said, “they are halting.” I immediately rode up, within a few yards of Alexander—they had halted. Not having known the bridge before—I cannot exactly say how near I was to it.—One of the cavalry in advance said— “Here they are.” I saw a party of persons on the bridge—I could not have seen that they had arms, unless they had fired. I called to the Constable to come up to speak to the people on the bridge. A gun flashed as soon as he came up. He went before me. Alexander and Shires were also before me. Before the flash I think I heard Whitehead say something, but not quite positive: the flash came from the party on the bridge. No report—a flash in the pan. Almost immediately several other guns were fired—also from the party assembled—I could see the light—their guns were directed towards my party—I think I heard at least 20 guns—rather irregularly—I think three or four as a volley—-upon the whole, irregularly—I remained there till about ten shots were fired. From the light of the firing and from what happened, I of course looked forward. The party were assembled rather on the fall of the bridge, that is, the other side of the Crown—I being on this side, could not see over their heads so as to ascertain if there were any great number immediately behind the first ranks—but 40 or 50 yards further on, I saw a moving body.— I conclude that the space between was occupied by men—not thinking I had sufficient forte, I retreated into the town, where I had greater numbers. I came out with numbers afterwards, and found they had dispersed.</p>
<p><em>George Whitehead.</em> I am Constable at Huddersfield,—I am deputy constable, and was so in June last.— On the 8th, I went with Captain Armytage and a patrole. Six privates, the captain, and myself. We went to Engine Bridge, it was between twelve and one.— Capt. A. ordered the small party he had with him to halt, and ordered me to ride to the front, and inquire what the assembled people wanted—I went within about ten yards of them, I saw a number assembled upon the bridge. I saw that one was armed, by his presenting a piece at me, which flashed in the pan—the first thing said, was one of the mob calling, who comes there? That was before the flash. I answered, what are you doing there? There was no answer, but immediately firing commenced from the mob. I was by the end of the bridge. The firing came from the centre. It was so dark that I could not see what direction the firing came—there were five shots before I turned my horse’s head round, to go back. All the shots came from the bridge. There were other shots after we commenced our retreat. Mr. Alexander was in the rear of me, within a yard of my horse. He was coming the same direction, till we halted. It is impossible for me speak to the numbers at the bridge. I should suppose upwards of 400 persons. We were nearly in a line between the bridge and Dawson’s house—It is on the road side. There is a house, just at the end of the bridge—that is not Dawson’s, I believe. It joins to it —is nearer than Dawson’s. I examined it next morning—there appeared to have been a ball striking the wall, from the mark of the lead.</p>
<p><em>David Alexander</em> sworn.—I was on duty on the 8th of June, in the Huddersfield Yeomanry. I was one of the party under Capt. Armytage. I rode a grey horse, and had a pistol in my hand. I was a little in advance within a few yards of the bridge. I halted when I saw a number of men. There were between 60 and 70 of them. Cannot say any them were dressed lighter than usual.—Capt. Armytage ordered the Constable to ask them what they wanted. A piece was presented and flashed in the pan, after the Constable spoke. I was advancing with the Constable. They said, What do you want? Constable said something which I did not rightly hear. Next thing was a flash in the pan.— A piece was then fired by the mob. I could see that it came from the end of the bridge. Several pieces were fired. I found my horse reel backwards, about the third shot. After several pieces were fired, we retreated. We came back with more force, and found the mob had dispersed. I found my horse was wounded in the fore part of the head with a ball. The ball was taken out; it was a pistol ball. I do not know what it was fired from. I examined the house near the bridge. It appeared to have been struck with a ball. The head of my horse was towards the bridge. The blood ran down his forehead from the wound. I felt the ball wound. (Produced the ball.) It was taken of horse’s head. Shots were fired after we retreated.</p>
<p><em>Nathan Taylor</em> sworn— I live at Well Green, about half a mile from Huddersfield, I keep a house there.—I remember the disturbances on the 8th of  June. I went to bed with my wife about 10 o’clock. I was called up about midnight, between 12 and 1 perhaps. I was disturbed by some men knocking my door who said, if I did not get up immediately, they would burst it open. I then got up. I found two men at my door. Each had a gun. They insisted on my dressing myself immediately, and going with them. They came into the inside of my door. They said I was to go with them. They would not tell me where. My wife asked, and they said to her, they were going to take me to Huddersfield. I went very much against my will. I had neither gun nor any thing else in my hand. Benjamin Lockwood was one of the men that had a gun. I went with him from my house to Knowle Hill. We joined William Crowther, who was with a man that forced him to get up, as well as me. We went all to Knowle Hill field, which is between Yew Green and Folly-hall bridge, the field is about a quarter of a mile from the bridge. The field lies on the left of the road, between Lockwood and Huddersfield. About 12 or 20 persons were there, when we went. We joined them. One of them had a gun. I cannot say any others were armed. I saw two scythes under a wall, but not in the hands of anyone. The party were about 12 yards from the scythes. Crowther and I stopped there about five minutes, and then made our escape. I returned home.</p>
<p>Cross-examined—It was a dark night, and on that account I cannot safely swear he was the man. I thought he was the man. My house is about a quarter of a mile from his house, I have had many opportunities of seeing him for a year past.</p>
<p><em>George Armitage</em>, sworn.—I am a shoemaker. I know Engine bridge. I was passing it the 8th of June. I had been a courting to a young girl at Lockwood. Before I came to the bridge, two men stopped me. I was coming from Lockwood to Huddersfield. They presented two guns at Charles Earnshaw and me. They said, come over into the field. Earnshaw asked what to do? They made answer, they wanted to see how many they could muster that night. Earnshaw turned round to me, and said, must we Armitage? The men said, if you don’t come over, we’ll shoot you. They forced us over the wall and drove us up the field. It was about half-past twelve. When we got up the field, there were a crowd people. There were two handkerchiefs at the top the wall.— I heard somebody say, those that have arms come hither. I saw some with guns, some with pistols. I cannot say how many. Eight or nine had guns or pistols. They went to the wall. A man that stood by the wall pulled something out of his pocket, and gave it to one of them.— It was a square lump. The man who got it came away, and said he had got twelve rounds. [On being desired to look at the four prisoners, he fixed upon three them by name, John Wilson, and Benjamin Lockwood—and the other prisoner by sight.] I did not see any of them in the <em>field</em>. I saw them all at the bridge, about the time of the firing. One man got a square lump the field, and said he had got twelve rounds. There was a lump as large as my hat in each handkerchief. I saw Joseph Croft in the field.—Somebody said, to those who had arms, that they might down to the rest. They all joined together. When we got to the bottom of the field, Earnshaw was going to turn, to go to Lockwood. They said. This is the road, and turned him back. We went to the bridge. They held two scythes across the road to prevent me from crossing the road. It was not one of the prisoners that stopped me with the scythes. I saw that man, (Joseph Jyssop,) also standing with a scythe at the foot of the bridge. Joseph Croft appeared to command. He said to them all that were armed, “kneel down.” They stood on each side of the road and kneeled down opposite each other. They extended from the bridge to the foot of the bridge. Their faces were towards Huddersfield. George Woffenden had a gun; Lockwood had gun. John Wilson ran past me with a gun or a pistol. When the Cavalry were coming up, Joseph Croft ordered them to keep kneeling; and cried out three times, Who come there? I was not on the bridge, but the causeway.— I heard him shout out, <em>“Fire!”</em> I was running away then, after a single piece had been fired first, and a good many afterwards. I saw Woffenden upon the bridge, with a gun, before the firing commenced. Lockwood was on the bridge with his gun. Jyssop had a scythe, before the firing, at the bridge. Wilson came running, after the dispersement, from the bridge towards Lockwood. He ran past me, while I was running too, about twenty-five yards from the bridge. I followed him betwixt the woods. When we were there, a gun went off on the top of Taylor-hill. Somebody said, have you nothing to answer it; upon which Wilson fired off his pistol. I then saw it. This might be about five minutes after I left the bridge. I went back to the girl at Lockwood, but she would not let me in. She had locked the door.</p>
<p>Cross-examined—The field called Knowle Hill, is where the handkerchiefs were. I saw Wilson in the field, not the others. I saw none of them there before I went to the bridge.</p>
<p><em>Capt. Armytage</em> called again.— I am positive the first shot was fired from the opposite party.</p>
<p>Two witnesses in favour of the prisoners deposed, that they had heard G. Armitage declare, that he did not know any of the persons who were among the mob. Others gave the prisoners a good character as far as they knew them.</p>
<p>The Jury after retiring about quarter of hour, brought all the prisoners—<em>Not Guilty</em>.</p>
<p>The Judge—“Prisoners at the bar, Take care of yourselves for the future. You have now had a very narrow escape, and if you persist in such practices as these, you may depend upon it you will bring yourselves to an untimely end.— Have a care of your future conduct.”</p>
<p><em>Prisoners</em>, (simultaneously).—“We will, indeed, Sir.”</p>

<p>SUMMER ASSIZES. YORK, Saturday, July 26. CROWN SIDE.</p>
<p>B. Lockwood, of Salford, in Lockwood, in the West Riding of this county, cloth dresser; G.  Waffenden, of the some place, cloth dresser; J. Wilson, of the same place and profession; and J. Jysop, of the same place add profession, were indicted for a capital offence, in aiding and abetting a tumultuous assembly, one of whom fired at D. Alexander, on the night of the 8th of June last, at Folly-hall-bridge, near Huddersfield, with the intent of murdering the said D. Alexander.</p>
<p>Capt. Armitage deposed, that he commanded the yeomanry cavalry of the district of Huddersfield; was called on the night of Sunday the 9th June, upon information that a tumultuary assemblage had collected at Folly-hall, or Engine-bridge, near Huddersfield. He proceeded with six patrole and the constable Whitehead, Witness saw an assemblage of men on the bridge; but from the darkness of the night he could not perceive whether they had arms not. He called out to the constable, to speak to them. The constable obeyed the summons; and as soon as he had come up witness observed fire flash in the pair of one of the guns or pistols borne by the rioters. He was certain that the flash proceeded from the party on the bridge. Instantaneously a gun was fired from the same party; and soon afterwards several others. All the shots might about 20. Witness remained till about 10 shots were fired. He saw a moving body beyond the centre of the bridge; and concluding that the intervening space was occupied by the party, and that subsequently their numbers were considerable, and considering that his party only consisted of six to oppose them, he thought it prudent to retreat to Huddersfield for an increase of force. He accordingly did so; and returning afterwards, when he had gained an accession of numbers, found that the rioters were dispersed.</p>
<p>G. Whitehead, a constable at Huddersfield, who accompanied the patrole, confirmed the testimony of the preceding witness.</p>
<p>D. Alexander, one the yeomanry cavalry of Huddersfield, was on duty on the 8th of June. He was a little in  advance; he halted at the end of bridge, where he saw men; they appeared to amount to 60 or 70. Before the constable spoke, the mob called out “Who comes there?” Immediately a gun flashed in the pan, another piece was fired, and soon after several more. At the third shot his horse staggered; the party retreated after several other shots were fired. About an hour afterwards he examined his horse’s head, and took out of it a pistol ball.</p>
<p>G. Armitage stated, that on the night of the 8th June he was at Lockwood, a short distance from Huddersfield, with C. Bamshaw. Two persons with guns stopped them, and said they must go along with them to a field close to Engine-bridge, as it had been resolved to try how many could be mustered. He saw none of the prisoners in the field except Wilson. They received orders to advance to the bridge. Two men with scythes, stretched out, stood on the crown of the bridge, and prevented any one from passing. At the bridge he saw Lockwood and Woffenden, who had guns. He saw Jysop there also with a scythe.— Croft appeared to have the command, and directed who had arms to arrange themselves on each side of the road, while those who had not stood in the middle. He then ordered those with arms to kneel. Heard the trampling of the horses feet when the cavalry were advancing; and then Croft calls out, three times, “Who comes there?” He did not hear what answer was made; but Croft ordered those who had arms to fire.</p>
<p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; but severa] witnesses were called in their behalf, who gave them good characters. The Jury retired about 10 minutes; and on their return, found all the prisoners— Not Guilty.</p>
</div>
<p>Two of the defendants absolved of the charge of burglary from Clement and Dyson were immediately re-arraigned on another charge; but no evidence was presented, the prosecution presumably recognising they had little chances of now securing a conviction.</p>
<p>Two others were not so lucky, however, with reports that Thomas Riley and Richard Lee were to be held by order of Lord Sidmouth on suspicion of High Treason, albeit under the Suspension Act (which is to say, the suspension of Habeas Corpus) which <em>would</em> almost certainly attract a severe capital penalty if successfully prosecuted.</p>

<p>[Comprehensive report of “Trial of the Rioters” p2-3]</p>
<p>JOHNSON and THEWLIS, two of the parties indicted in the preceding case, were immediately arraigned on another indictment, charging them with a burglary, on the night of the 8th of June, in the house of Sarah Jessop, of Honley.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping.—Gentlemen of the Jury, it is not my intention, on the part of the Crown, to offer any evidence before you, against the prisoners at the bar, and therefore they will be discharged.</p>
<p><em>The Court.</em>—Gentlemen, You will find the prisoners —<em>Not Guilty</em>.</p>
<p>The prisoners, of course, were immediately acquitted.</p>
<p>[Then follows a report of Lockwood, Woffenden, Wilson and Jyssop]</p>
<p>The Lord Lieutenant was present during these trials.— The verdicts, we understand, were received with the most profound silence.— It was rumoured, at York, on Saturday night, that no further prosecutions, against the Rioters still remaining in custody, would be gone into.— Tho. Riley, of Crosland Moor, tailor, and Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, clothier, are detained, under a warrant from Lord Sidmouth, on suspicion of High Treason. …</p>

Sun (London) - Monday 28 July 1817</p>
<p>YORKSHIRE ASSIZES, Friday July 25</p>
<p>CROWN SIDE.</p>
<p>TRIAL OF LUDDITES.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin Donkersly</em>, of Honley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, weaver; <em>Joseph Sykes</em>, of the same place, clothier; <em>Isaac Johnson</em>, of Holmfirth, in the same Riding, labourer; <em>Joshua Thewlis</em>, of the same place, labourer; <em>Abraham Oldham</em> and <em>John Oldham</em>, of Honley, in the same Riding, labourers; were indicted for a robbery and burglary at the house of Clement Dyson, in the said town of Honley, on the night of Sunday the 8th of June last.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping, Mr. Scarlett, Mr. Raine, and another Learned Gentleman, were Counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Williams, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Maude, for four of the prisoners.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping addressed the Jury. He described the riotous assembling of the prisoners, with others, to the number of 30 or 40, on the night specified in the indictment, the alarm they excited by their menacing and tumultuous conduct, and their general demand for arms, through the object of which they meant to accomplish after they had obtained them could not be very well guessed.— As the prisoners stood charged with burglary, in robbing the house of the prosecutrix of a gun, it was not necessary to look to the riot as connected with any political views. The outrages that were commited and threatened were no doubt violent; but, except in so far as this single robbery was the consequence of them, they were not now before the jury.</p>
<p>Hanna Dyson deposed, that a number of persons came to her door between eleven and twelve o’clock on the night in question; that her husband was far from home, and she was alone in the house; that they called for arms; that they knocked at the door, and not gaining admission, burst it open; that she, in consequence of their demand and threats, went and brought them a gun which she had in the house; that she gave it to one of the mob, she could not tell whom, but that she recognized Dankersly and two of the other prisoners, who were her neighbours; and saw one man with his waistcoat turned inside out, who, according to what she subsequently learned, must have been Sykes. This witness underwent a long cross-examinaiion, for the purpose of showing that she was not to be credited in deposing to the identity of the prisoners, from the length of time she had allowed to lapse before she appeared against them (being nearly a month); from her having declared immediately after the outrage that she could not distinguish then from any of the mob; from her alleged declaration that they were all strangers to her; and from a reported saying of her’s, that the trade of a witness was a very profitable thing, as she could get two guineas a day by it. She totally denied the latter report and insinuation, and accounted both for her long silence in bringing charges against her riotous neighbours, and her alleged contradictions, in saying at one time she could not identify those whom she now appeared against from motives of fear. She had seen Donkersly about nine o’clock of the night in question, making motions as if with a gun to another of the rioters, and could not be mistaken, as to him, when he appeared among the crowd that demanded arms about 12 o’clock, as he was then only three or four yards from the door. She did not know the man to whom she gave the gun, nor did she ever mention that he was one Charlesworth, though she had said that he was one of the party. The night immediately after the outrage she had told one of her neighbours, S. Hurst, than she had recognized Donkersby in the crowd. Her husband arrived from London about a fortnight after the robbery, and she was examined before the Justices at Huddersfield about a fortnight after his arrival. Her husband had been in London on law business, or to learn law. He was not in the King’s Bench or the Fleet, but learning law, after he had failed as a cloth-dresser. He had been learning law for 24 weeks, but she , not being acquainted with the subject, could not tell what branch of it he practised. Being asked if he began to practise first in advising her to go before the Justices to accuse her neighbours, she answered, no, and that he did not know her business. This witness appeared to hesitate a deal in that part of her cross-examination related to what she had said to one Hobson, about her not knowing the prisoners among the party who demanded arms. Being asked if he had put the question, she answered successively “he might have done so—perhaps he did do so —yes, he did.”</p>
<p>Samuel Winpenny, examined by Mr. SCARLETT, deposed, that he knew Isaac Johnson the prisoner; that he saw him on Sunday night, the 8th of June; that prisoner told witness he was going to a meeting about 10 or 11 o’clock, and that he requested witness to prepare himself to accompany him. Two other persons were then present, Jonathan Fallas, and Joshua Thewlis, one of the prisoners. Witness went home with Jonathan Fallas to prepare himself, but did not intend to go, and was partly undressed to go to bed when the prisoner Johnson came to inquire if he was ready. He showed a desire of remaining at home, but Johnson told him that their companions expected him, and said it would be an affair of life or death if he did not keep his assignation. On this witness acquiesced, from fear, and accompanied them as a spectator. Witness went out with Fallas, Johnson, and Thewlis, and accompanied them to a place called Far-end, where he found a number of persons assembled; with all of whom he was unacquainted, except one. The meeting might consist of between 30 or 40 persons. There was much donfusion; some were for going one way, and some another, to get arms; when of the party stepped forward, and desired them to fall into the ranks, and march to Honley, which is about a quarter of a mile from Far-end. They all obeyed the order, and fell into ranks. Only six of them, had arms, and their object was to arm the rest. They went to Dyson’s house and demanded arms, but witness did not know who made the demand, or who received the gun. They knocked at the door, and as it was not speedily opened, the prisoner Johnson desired to break it open. The witness heard one of the party say, that they had got  something, either gun or pistol. Witness after this returned home. He saw Johnson and Fallas afterwards, who told him the party went to several other places and demanded arms, but desired him never to mention the circumstance, as, if it were known, they would be hanged. Thewlis gave him the same charge, under the same penalty, on the Wednesday following the Sunday of the outrage. Fallas and Cocket, two of the parry, had since fled.</p>
<p>This witness was cross-examined by Mr. WILLIAMS, for the purpose of showing that he had previously concerted the meeting; that he had entered into the project with the same zeal as his companions; that there were no threats used of the kind he mentioned; and that he was now giving evidence against his companions to save his own life, or to promote his own advantage. It appeared that he had been taken up as one of the party on the Wednesday night after the riot; that he had been in custody ever since, and that he came to York in custody. He, however, denied that he gave evidence to save himself; that he had no hopes of doing so when he gave the information he now stated in his depositions; and that he expected then he should be put on his trial in the same manner as the rest of his companions, against whom he was hearing testimony,</p>
<p>Joshua Kemp deposed, on his examination for the prosecution, that he was at Honley, and remembered the circumstances of the 8th of June. In consequence of having heard from one Butterworth that there was to be a meeting, he went to join the party, and saw among them the two Oldhams, prisoners at the Bar. There were about half a score on the bridge at Honley; they went afterwards to Far-end, where they were joined by a number more, making up both together about 20 or 30 persons. Some of the <em>holders forth</em> said they should march to Huddersfield; but George Taylor, one of them, proposed they should first proceed to Honley to procure arms, mentioning houses in which they might be found. They accordingly went to Dyson’s, and witness described the proceedings there nearly in the terms of the former evidence, mentioning the presence of some of the prisoners. Being cross-examined, he said that he did not see who received the gun; he knew Johnson before, and saw him at the house, in the crowd, about ten yards from the door. He saw Mrs. Dyson hand out the gun. He himself bore arms, and was active, but asked for none. He never declared that he took a pistol, or boasted of the exploit, though he received two. He was in the rear-rank when the party marched from Far-end. He was first examined on the 16th of June, being taken into custody, and had been twice afterwards examined upon oath as a witness against his companions. He had come as a prisoner to York, but, like the former witness, expected no reward for his evidence, and was not sure at first that he was free front prosecution by giving it. He confessed, however, that he thought his own neck dearer to him than that of any other man, and would be glad to save it if he could. Being asked if he was now doing his best to save it, he answered that he hoped so. He turned from being a prisoner to be a witness on the same day.</p>
<p>Susan Hurst was examined for the purpose of identifying Sykes, the prisoner, by giving evidence to his wearing on the night of the outrage a waistcoat turned inside out, and of proving that Mrs. Dyson, the prosecutrix had on the following day mentioned to her that she knew three of the prisoners who committed the robbery on her house. She lives next door to Sykes, and heard a rap at his door on Sunday night about 12 o’clock. She heard him coming down, and asked him next day why he did not open the door to answer the call sooner, when he said that he was in such a hurry to do so that he put on his waistcoat turned in the manner described.</p>
<p>The evidence for the prosecution here ended.– The prisoners being asked what they had to say in their defence, two of them gave in a written paper, the contents of which we could not distinctly hear; and the rest left their defence with their Counsel, who called several witnesses to contradict the testimony of the prosecutrix in some points, and to speak to their previous character and conduct. All these witnesses gave the prisoners an excellent character; most of them had known them from their infancy, or for a long term of years, and had never heard any thing to sully their reputation for honesty, industry, peaceable conduct, and inoffensive dispositions. One of the neighbours of the Oldhams said, he knew them from their childhood, and they were quiet honest men, who disturbed nobody. The same thing was said nearly in the same terms of the rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Wood then summed up the evidence, pointing out its nature, and how it applied to the different prisoners.</p>
<p>The Jury, after consulting for a short time, returned a verdict of <em>Not Guilty</em> with regard to all.</p>
<p>The two Oldhams were then put to the Bar on another charge; but the prosecution calling no evidence, they were acquitted.— The verdict was heard with testimonies of satisfaction by the spectators. The Court was crowded to excess in every part. To-morrow comes on the trial of the rioters of Huddersfield, which are expected to be more interesting than the above.</p>

<p>YORK ASSIZES— July 25, TRIAL OF LUDDITES.</p>
<p>Benjamin Donkersly, Joseph Sykes, Isaac Johnson, Joshua Thewlis, Abraham Oldham, and John Oldham, were indicted for a robbery and burglary at the house of Clement Dyson, in Honley. on the night of Sunday the 8th of last.— Hannah Dyson, Samuel Winpenny, Joshua Kemp, and Susan Hurst, were severally examined; after which Mr. Baron Wood summed up the evidence, pointing out its nature, and how it applied to the different prisoners. — The jury, after consulting for a short time, returned a verdict of <em>Not Guilty</em> with regard to all.— The two Oldhams were then put to the bar on another charge; but the prosecution calling no evidence, they were acquitted.</p>

TRIALS OF THE HUDDERSFIELD RIOTERS.</p>
<p>Benjamin Lockwood, George Woffenden, John Wilson, and Joseph Jyssop, charged with being present, counselling, aiding, and assisting, a person unknown, in firing a loaded gun at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield Yeomanry Cavalry, at Folly Hall Bridge, near Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th June last, were <em>acquitted</em>.</p>
<p>All the rioters against whom true bills were found are, we believe, now tried and acquitted.</p>
<p>From the evidence, it is quite clear that the riots were of a most alarming character, though the guilt of having been engaged in them was not fixed upon the persons who have stood their trials.</p>
<p>The Judge exhorted the prisoners to beware of continuing in such dangerous courses. They had had a narrow escape, and might rest assured, if they continued such practices, they would infallibly come to an untimely death. The prisoners answered, simultaneously, “We will, indeed, my Lord.”</p>
<p>The Lord Lieutenant was present during these trials.— The verdicts, we understand, were received with the most profound silence.— It was rumoured, at York, on Saturday night, that no further prosecutions against the Rioters still remaining in custody, would be gone into.— Tho. Riley, of Crosland Moor, tailor, and Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, clothier, are detained, under a warrant from Lord Sidmouth, on suspicion of High Treason.</p>
</div>
<p>For the prosecuting counsel, the verdicts were certainly not what they had hoped for:</p>

<p>York. July 30.</p>
<p>The Court met this morning at ten o’clock, and the convicted prisoners being called to the bar, Mr. Baron Wood proceeded to pass sentence.  …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>… Of the 25 persons committed on charges connected with the late riots in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, only eight were brought to trial and acquitted; against the greatest number no bill was found; two traversed; and Thomas Riley, one of the rioters, a taylor, stands charged under a warrant from Lord Sidmouth, on suspicion of high treason. With the omission of the rioters, and those against whom no bill was found, the calendar was not very numerous for such a county as York, in such a season of distress; nor, excepting the case of two who are left for execution, were the crimes charged against the prisoners of very atrocious character.</p>

<h4 class="rubric" id="huddersfield-plot">Huddersfield Plot</h4>
<p>Friday, July 25</p>
<p>JOSEPH SYKES, ISAAC JOHNSON, JOSHUA THEWLIS, ABRAHAM OLDHAM, JOHN OLDHAM, and BENJAMIN DONKERSLEY, were charged together with GEORGE TAYLOR and BENJAMIN SHAW, not yet taken, and other persons unknown, with burglariously breaking into the dwelling house of Clement Dyson of Honley, on the night of the 8th of June last, and feloniously stealing and taking away one gun, value 40s.</p>
<p>The prisoners to this indictment, severally pleaded NOT GUILTY.</p>
<p>The following gentlemen were sworn of the Jury:— John Hood, Richard Baker, Thomas Sale, William Pickard, Robert John Walker, Thomas Wilberfoss, James Hebden, Robert Linsdale, Thomas Clarke, J. Matthewman, T. Ellerby, and Anthony Kitchen.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prosecution— Messrs. TOPPING, RAINE, SCARLETT, and RICHARDSON.— Solicitor, Mr. LE BLANC.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prisoners.— MESSRS. MAUDE, WILLIAMS and JONES.Solicitor, Mr. OVEREND.</p>
<p>Mr. RICHARDSON opened the indictment.</p>
<p>Mr. Topping stated the case on the part of the prosecution: after describing the nature of the offence, which was a burglary, he observed that this prosecution was carried on by the government; and when he had opened and proved his case, every good man would agree with him in feeling that it was of such a nature, that government would have deserted its trust if it had not submitted it to public investigation, and the decision of a Jury. It was notorious that discontent and great disturbances had existed in the western part of this county for some time; this he said not to create prejudice, or to excite their attention; the case must be determined, like all other cases, by its own evidence; and the Jury must lay out of their minds all that they had heard upon the subject out of Court. The learned Counsel proceeded to detail the nature of the evidence by which he proposed to establish the guilt of the prisoners. He concluded with stating his conviction that he was addressing a Jury who would discharge their duty honestly and firmly; that they would acquit the prisoners, if the evidence laid before them did not satisfy them that they were guilty, and do their duty by pronouncing a verdict of guilty.</p>
<p>The Counsel for the prosecution called the following witnesses:—</p>
<p><em>Mrs. H. Dyson</em> stated, that she was the wife of Clement Dyson, and lives at Honley: Witness, on the night of the 8th of June, went to bed about nine o’clock, having previously locked and bolted the door; she was awoke by a knocking at the door, and some voices called out, “Your firelock, immediately.”— Witness at first denied having one in the house, but on their threatening to knock the door in pieces, she fetched it from the garret: before she had time to get it, they had broken the door open:—one of the men just stepped with his foot into the house, and reaching out his arm, took the gun. Witness cannot speak to the person to whom she gave it, and looking after them, said “You are a set of <em>ludding</em> rogues; you will never be quiet until you are hung in a string.”— One of the men said, “Turn again and blow a ball through her!” Witness said, “Feral(?), dare you?” The men were standing in two rows: there were about seven in each row. Witness saw Joseph Sykes, who came up the steps leading to her door; had his waistcoat the wrong side out, but could not say whether he had his coat on or not; she knew Sykes before. After some hesitation, witness also pointed out Benjamin Dunkersley as another of the persons she could speak to as being there:—Next morning she saw Sykes; he said to her “Have you had the men at your door to-night?” She replied, “you are like to know, you was one of them.” He turned his back upon her at this, and was as white as a clout. Witness could not speak to the value of the gun; it was given to her husband the last Lud time: it was a good one, and had a good touch-hole: Sykes knew that, for he had let it off a few days before; might be worth thirty shillings.</p>
<p>In answer to a question from the Judge, she said the man who took the gun just put his foot into the inside of the door, and stretching out his arm took the gun.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined by Mr. MAUDE:–— Is a married woman: her husband was not at home at that time, he was in London on business; he was in the law: had been in the King’s Bench prison: he came home, but witness does not remember how long ago; has taken up the law business since he returned. After some immaterial questions about her family, and the state of her dress when she gave the gun, she was asked how she knew Sykes’s waistcoat, when she could speak to no other part of his dress; she said it was the pocket, and she knew the man. Witness was closely preseed to state whether she had ever said to Mr. Robinson, that she did not know of the men: she fenced a long time with the question; she would not admit at first that she could recollect having any conversation at all with him, or in his presence, upon the subject; she really did not know, really did not recollect, and really could not tell, she was so frightened; and it was not until the Judge repeatedly charged her to answer the question, the Counsel insisting either on an affirmative or negative answer, that she said, “Well, then I did say I did not know any of them, for I was afraid of my family.” <em>(Witness had just stated that he told Sykes to his face, that he was one of them.)</em> Witness knows Richard Littlewood: she could not say that she ever had any conversation with him upon the subject; will swear that she never had. Knows Geo. Boothroyd, who is one of her tenants; never spoke to him on the subject: had no conversation with him: he never spoke to her upon it; is quite sure of that. Witness knows Mr. G. Hobson, who lives at Honley; had a little conversation with him about it, when he was coming from Huddersfield, where he had been examined: he asked her if she had been to swear against any of the men; witness said to him, “when I am called upon I will speak the truth, but I have not sworn to any of them.”—She was examined four times at Huddersfield.</p>
<p>[His Lordship here enquired of Mr. Ailen, who was in Court, what had become of these examinations. Mr. Le Blanc, Solicitor to the Crown in this prosecution, said the examination to which the witness had referred, was not upon oath. His Lordship complained that the depositions of none of the witnesses had been returned to him, until she had particularly enquired for them. It was the duty of the committing Magistrate to return all the depositions, for the information of the Judge. Mr. Allen stated that Mrs. Dyson had not been examined upon oath, and with respect to the other examinations he did not know but they had been regularly returned: Mr. Allison, Solicitor, on the following day, said to the Judge, when the subject was again mentioned, that if there was any blame, it must attach to him; and the delay had arisen from his not knowing what was the usual course on these occasions, as he was not in the habit of acting as Clerk to the Magistrates.]</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Dyson’s</em> cross-examination having been resumed: She said she had never been a witness in that Court before—had been at York in 1815, but was not called upon—never said that it was a rare thing being a witness, and that she got two guinea a day— was examined by Mr. Jones, as Counsel for Donkersley—said she did not see Donkersley on the 8th of June until night, between nine and ten of clock, in Mr. Brook’s Croft, just before it was dark: he was making motions as if he had a gun in his hand, he had nothing: another man was with him, and was walking round him; he was very near his own house–she is quite sure he was one of the persons at her lodgings that night, he was three or four yards from the door— always said that she did not know the man to whom she gave the gun— has never sworn to any person as being that man. Witness knows Charles Charlesworth, but never mentioned him as the person to whom she wave the gun, or named him as being one of the party—never said that she knew him by his voice—might mention his name to the Magistrate, but not as being one of the party, she might have been asked if she knew him and told him that if she had been as ready as he was to take up her boy, she might have charged him as being one of the men at her house, for she had given the gun to him and no one else. Witness said she was sure she never said at any time, or to anyone, that he was the man, that she knew him by his voice, nor any words to that effect—does not know when she first mentioned the name of Donkersley—she first mentioned it to an old woman, Susan Hirst, the night of the robbery; no other person was present when she mentioned it—her husband returned from London fourteen days after it happened—her first examination was a month and three days after the robbery—it was not until her husband returned that she was first examined, he had been in London nearly five weeks on law business—he never practised law before he went there—was there twenty-four weeks learning the law.</p>
<p>Witness, on her re-examination, said her husband is what they call an agent, he is a good writer, has written for attornies, and done businesses for them.— Mr. Le Blanv was the first man before whom she was examined.</p>
<p><em>Samuel Winpenny</em> knows the prisoner Isaac Johnson; saw him in the evening of the 8th of June, when he told the witness that he must get himself ready, as there was to be a meeting that night at the Banks: saw Johnson again that night; he came to his house as he was undressing himself for bed, and said to him, “what! are you not ready?”—to which he replied, that he thought he would not go; when Johnson told him that Richard Haigh had said, that it would be either life or death if people did not go and that they would be safer there than at home; he then consented to go to Far End to look at them. Witness accompanied Johnson and the prisoner Thewlis, who was waiting at the door. There was a number of people there: he knew only Johnson, Thewlis, Cockin, Fellas, and Joseph Beaumont. There were between 30 and 40 men, of whom 7 or 8 had guns and pistols: great confusion prevailed—some being for one thing, others for another—some wishing to go to Honley, others to go home. It was at last decided to go to Honley; they marched in ranks two deep, those who had arms going foremost. The first place they demanded arms at was Wm. Heelis’s House. They next went to Dyson’s house; one of them demanded arms; and, as the person in the house did not immediately open the door, Isaac Johnson said, “d——n it, knock it open.” Witness heard one of them say, they had got a gun, which the woman had given them, but did not see them get it: does not know whether the door was forced open or was opened from within: he left them soon after: saw Thewlis and Fellas on the Wednesday after, who told him they had gone to several other places and demanded arms. Fellas and Cockin have both absconded. Witness said the men were all crowded about the door, and were not in ranks, or in any order.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined: said he did not know any thing of the meeting before that night. He was frightened at what Johnson said, and that prompted him to go: he was only a looker-on. It is three miles from his house to Dyson’s: would not have gone, but was threatened and persuaded to go: he was taken up on the Wednesday night after this happened, and has been in custody ever since: had no expectation that he should be benefited by giving his evidence.</p>
<p>Witness, in answer to a question from the Judge, said, on his second examination before the magistrate, he had told the same tale as he had done to-day. The examination was shown to him, which was, he said, what he had signed. He did not know it to be Dyson’s house, but was told it was Donkersley’s.</p>
<p><em>J. Kemp</em> lives at Honley; was induced to go to the meeting by Uriah Butterworth, who told him that if he would go to Honley Bridge, he would see a great many people, as something was going to he done at Huddersfield. Witness went to Honley; saw the two Oldhams there, and half a score people on Honley Bridge: went to the Far End, near Honley, to meet the Holmfirth people: there might be between twenty and thirty. The Holmfirth people said they would not go to Huddersfield without arms, and it was agreed to go to Honley to collect them. He pointed out Johnson and the two Oldhams as being there; Abraham Oldham was armed with a gun.—Witness was one of the party at Clement Dyson’s house; they went to the door, knocked, and called for arms; heard some person say, “knock the door open;” cannot tell who said this, Witness does not know who got the gun; he put his hand and foot at the inside of the door to receive it. Does not recollect seeing Johnson there. It was George Taylor that proposed they should go to Honley to collect arms.</p>
<p>Witness, on his cross-examination, said, he could not state that Johnson was there. He (the witness) had a gun: he took no arms from any one. Benjamin Shaw gave him two pistols, which he concealed. Shaw was one of the party. Witness was in the third rank; a person of the name of Taylor had the command; there were three in a row from Honley Bridge to Huddersfield. When witness was first examined it was as a  prisoner—he was then transferred into a witness; he did not make his disclosures with a view of becoming a witness, or of serving himself; he thought himself as bad as others; does not know whether he shall be prosecuted or not; admitted that he hoped his giving evidence would save himself, his neck being dearer to him than the neck of any other person. They were in rows when they marched towards Huddersfield; but not so when at Dyson’s. His first examination took place at the White Hart Inn, Huddersfield; has been examined three times; said he did not kiss the book the first time; he was examined as a party charged, then turned into a witness, and interrogated upon oath. It was at twelve o’clock on Sunday night when he kissed the book the first time. Witness signed his name several times; he signed it every time he was examined.</p>
<p><em>Susan Hirst</em> was called to prove that she heard a gentle rap at Joseph Sykes’s door, on the night of the 8th of June, about twelve o’clock, and sometime after heard a person go down stairs; and that next morning Sykes told her that he could not find his clothes, and that he had put his waistcoat the wrong side out.</p>
<p>On her cross-examination she said, she had often talked over the matter with Mrs. Dyson, who said she could swear to three or four of the persons who were at her house. Witness is next door neighbour to Joseph Sykes.</p>
<p>This finished the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p>The Prisoners being called upon for their defence left it to their Counsel.</p>
<p>The examination of Winpenny was then read by the permission of the Judge, on the part of the prisoners. The account given by him of the transactions of this night, varied very much from that given in Court; it was silent as to his being induced to go in consequence of intimidation, and of being frightened into it.</p>
<p>Kemp’s examination was also read, but there was no material variation in it, from the evidence he gave in Court. Kemp being called up again by the prisoners’ Counsel, stated that he remained with the party until the last. After the party had been to Dyson’s they proceeded to the house of Sykes (one of the prisoners); witness did not see what passed, but the crowd said that neither Sykes nor his gun were in the house.</p>
<p>The four following witnesses were examined, to contradict various parts of the evidence of the wife of Clement Dyson.</p>
<p><em>Mr. J. Robinson</em> lives at Honley; knows the wife of Clement Dyson, who is tenant to the witness; she was at his house on Wednesday, the 11th of June—his wife said unto her in his hearing, “You have had these people at your house I understand ;” she said they had. “Don’t you know any of them?” rejoined his wife. Mrs. Dyson replied, “No, I do not know one of them—they were all strangers to me.” Witness said the object of Mrs. Dyson was to ask if he had sent Sykes for a gun, which he had borrowed: he replied he had. He has known Sykes twenty years, who occasionally has been in his employment, and he always considered him as a very honest man. Witness also spoke favourably of Donkersley’s character.</p>
<p><em>Mr. George Holron</em> is a clothier; lives at Honley; deposed to a conversation with Dyson’s wife, about Charles Charlesworth: she told the witness that he (Charlesworth) bad taken up her son, for taking a hang lock from a gate; and that she had been that morning and told him that he was the man to whom she had given the gun upon the door steps, and that it was nobody else. Witness saic, did not say that it was him, but that she had told him so. At another time she told the witness, that she thought she knew Sykes, Donkersley, and Shaw; and upon his asking her why she said before that she knew none of them, she replied, it was because she did not wish to have ill-will among her neighbours. He knows Sykes, Donkersley, and the two Oldhams, they have very good characters.</p>
<p><em>Richard Littlewood</em> lives at Honley; conversed with Mrs. Dyson, the day after the robbery at their house; she said that she did not know any person that was there. He saw her again in the course of that week; she repeated, that she did not know any of them. Has known Sykes from a boy, and never heard any thing bad of him.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scarlett. Witness was not up that night (the 8th of June): did not hear of any thing until eight o’clock on the following morning: was not at all alarmed. He heard afterwards that there had been disturbances. Mrs. Dyson did not mention any thing of a man with his waistcoat inside out.</p>
<p><em>George Boothroyd</em> is a clothier and lives at Honley; had a conversation with Mrs. Dyson about the robbery, on the Monday morning after it had taken place, between seven and eight o’clock; heard her say there had been some men at their house for a gun; and she said, the prisoner Sykes being present, she did not know one of them. Has known Sykes many years, never knew any thing bad of him.</p>
<p>Jonas Rowbottom, George Halliwell, William Mellor, Matthew Falkener, and James Winpenny, spoke to the characters of the different prisoners.</p>
<p>Mr. Scarlett proposed that Mr. Allen, one of the committing Magistrates, should be sworn to explain the examination of the witnesses, Winpenny and Kemp.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Wood said he could not receive evidence to that effect. The examinations must speak for themselves.</p>
<p>His Lordship, in charging the Jury said, it was clear that very great outrages had occurred in the district where this offence was stated to have been committed: that there had been an assemblage at men armed with guns and other offensive weapons, was also clear, but for what purpose did not appear from the evidence, though there could be no doubt that it was for a purpose altogether illegal; it was equally clear that it was the duty of the Magistrates to suppress those outrages, and to endeavour to apprehend the persons engaged in them, and that this was an investigation and enquiry which it was highly proper for government to institute, It was, however, the duty of the Court and of the Jury to confine their attention to the case before then:; nor should they suffer their minds to be prejudiced by any thing that had taken place, or that they might have heard out of Court. The offence must be brought home to the prisoners by legitimate evidence or they must be acquitted. The crime with which they stood charged was that of burglariously breaking into and stealing in a dwelling-house in the night time; and to render a person guilty of this offence, it was not necessary that he should be the person who actually entered the house or who received the goods; it was sufficient if he was present, or near enough to aid, comfort, and afford assistance to the persons engaged in the offence. No questions of law could arise in the case. If the prisoners were present at the time, and with the person who committed the robbery (being in the night time) they would be guilty of the offence imputed to them by the indictment. He should proceed to state the evidence which had been given by the Crown and for the prisoners. The testimony of Hannah Dyson, his Lordship observed, had been materially impeached by the witnesses for the prisoner. Her evidence was given in a manner which could not have escaped the notice of the Jury. It was a long time before she would give answer any to the questions put to her by the Counsel for the prisoners—she at first denied having had any conversation with Mr. Robinson upon the subject— then said she could not recollect—and at last admitted that she had held such a conversation—that he did ask a question, and that she answered that she did not know any of the men. She also denied having had any conversation with Littlewood and with George Boothroyd, in which also she was flatly contradicted. It was also a singular circumstance that she should take upon her to speak with so much certainty to Joseph Sykes having had his waistcoat on the wrong side, and yet should have taken so little notice as not to know what sort of a coat he had on, or whether he had any coat or not. She also represented the men who were at her door as ranged in ranks in regular order, but Winpenny expressly stated that they all crowded together. His Lordship, in commenting on the threatening language used by Mrs. Dyson towards Charles Charlesworth, said “what kind of a woman must she be to say, she could charge him with receiving the gun from her, when she stated on her oath, that she did not know to whom she gave it, it, <em>(sic)</em> and this because he had given her offence in taking up her son. She must be a bad women to use such a threat.” With respect to the two witnesses for the Crown, Wimpenny and Kemp, they stood in the situation of accomplices, and as such, though competent witnesses were not entitled to credit unless materially confirmed—a confirmation which they could not receive from the evidence of the first witness, which itself required to be confirmed. In addition to this drawback arising from their situation as accomplices, the testimony of Winpenny was inconsistent with a prior account he had given upon oath of the particulars of his conduct with respect to the transactions of this night. In his testimony to-day, he had represented himself as engaging unwillingly in the burglary—as being threatened and frightened into it. In his examination before the magistrates there is not a word of all this; on the contrary it appears that he engaged voluntarily in it—that he was a member of the Society—that he contributed money to its support, and that he had previously agreed to go to the scene of depredation. On the evidence of Kemp, his Lordship said it was not inconsistent with his former examination. He did not mention Sykes as being present, and it would rather follow from his evidence that he was not supposed to be there by the party, because when they went to Sykes’s house, it was said that neither he or his gun was in the house; and they would hardly have expected to find him there if he was with them at the time. After going through the whole of the evidence, his Lordship concluded his charge in nearly the following terms:—This- gentlemen, is the whole of the evidence on both sides; I have before stated the law upon the subject, and if you shall be satisfied from the evidence, that the prisoners, all of them, or any of them, were present when the door of Dyson’s house was broken open as stated by the first witness, all of them, or such of them as were so present, will be guilty of the charge imputed to them by the present indictment. The question for your consideration then is, were the prisoners present when the robbery took place? The main witness in support of the charge, is Mrs. Dyson, you have heard the evidence she has given. and the manner in which she has given it, and the degree in which it has been contradicted. The evidence of the other two witnesses you will consider with reference to their situation as accomplices, and the inconsistency which I have stated in the evidence of the former with his previous depositions. These are the observations I have thought it right to make; to which I will add that the prisoners have had good characters given them. If, taking the whole of the case and the evidence into your consideration, you think that the charge is made out against the prisoners, and that the facts are established to your satisfaction, you will find the prisoners guilty. If the evidence should leave it as a matter of doubt, you will then suffer character to have its weight to turn the scale in their favour, and in that case you will acquit them.</p>
<p>The Jury turned round in their box for a few moments, and then pronounced all the prisoners NOT GUILTY.</p>

<p>For the Saturday trial, of Lockwood and others for malicious shooting, BAron Wood appears to have done what he could in casting doubt as to whether those charged could be identified without significant doubt.</p>

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817</p>
<p>SATURDAY JULY 26</p>
<p>TRIAL OF LOCKWOOD and OTHERS,<br />
<em>for Malicious Shooting.</em></p>
<p>BENJAMIN LOCKWOOD, GEO. WOFFENDEN, JOHN WILSON and JOSEF JYSOP, were charged together with JOSEPH JYSOP and BENJAMIN DYSON, (not in custody) with aiding and abetting a certain person unknown, in firing a loaded gun or pistol with an intent to kill, maim, disable, or do some grievous bodily harm to David Alexander, on the night of the 8th of June last.</p>
<p>The following Gentlemen were sworn of the Jury: Thomas Barker. George Alder, George Stelling, John Nicholson, Willian Ronsley, George Addison, John Dinsley, John Carling, James Featherstone, Christopher Robinson, Joseph Smith, and Anthony Kitchen.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prosecution— Messrs. TOPPING, RAINE, SCARLETT, and RICHARDSON.— Solicitor, Mr. LE BLANC.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prisoners— Messrs. WILLIAMS and STARKIE.— Solicitor, Mr. ALEXANDER.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson opened the indictment.</p>
<p>Mr. TOPPING addressed the Jury.—He said, whatever night be the issue of that trial, it was an investigation which it was the imperious duty of the government to institute: he did not enter into any general history of the discontents in this part of the West-Riding, nor did he assign any object for the armed assemblage the proceedings of which formed the subject of the present indictments. The following witnesses were called on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<p><em>Captain John Armitage</em> is the commander of the Huddersfield yeomanry Cavalry; was at Huddersfield on the 8th of June; he was called up late at night, and had some information communicated to him, which induced him to go, accompanied by six privates of his corps and the constable (Whitehead) to a place called Engine Bridge ( also called Folly-hall Bridge.) David Alexander and Shires were in the advance, and rode about fifty yards before the rest of the party, when they arrived near the bridge, witness had almost lost sight of Alexander, and immediately he heard some of the party say, they have halted. Witness then rode within a few yards of the advance, and found they were halted. Witness, on account of the darkness of the night, could not exactly say how far they were from the bridge; not more than a few yards. He heard Alexander say here they are; his attention was directed forwards, and he saw a party of persons assembled on the bridge; he could not distinguish that they had arms, except from the firing. Witness called out the constable from the rear, and directed him to go and speak to them; he came up; and as soon as he approached them, he saw a gun flash in the pani. He (the witness) heard a few words said by Whitehead before he saw this, but could not distinguish them, and he could not be quite positive. The flash proceeded from the party on the bridge; no report followed the flash. The next moment, several other guns were fired from the party assembled on the bridge; could see from the light made by the firing, that the guns were directed towards his party; twenty guns at least were fired; the firing was irregular; three or four appeared to be fired rather in a volley; on the whole, he should say the firing was irregular. We remained there (continued the witness) until ten shots were fired. He looked forward to see, by the light of the firing, what numbers were assembled; the party were rather on the fall of the bridge on the other side: could not see immediately over the heads of the men who were nearest him, so as to discover whether the space immediately behind them was occupied; but forty or fifty yards beyond the bridge, he saw a moving mass of people, but could not ascertain the number; if the whole space to the bridge was occupied, as he thought it was, the number must have been very considerable:— under these circumstances, he thought it improper to risk the lives of his small party, and they retired upon a larger force he had in the town of Huddersfield; but on his return with a more considerable force, the party had entirely dispersed. Mr. Alexander was mounted on a grey horse. Engine Bridge is about a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield.</p>
<p><em>George Whitehead</em> is the deputy constable of Huddersfield; went with Captain Armitage and six privates on the night of the 8th of June last, to Engine Bridge; got there between twelve and one; when they arrived near the bridge, Captain Armitage ordered the party to halt, and desired the witness to go to the front and enquire what they wanted? by <em>they</em>, he understood the mob, who were assembled on the bridge. Witness could see a number of persons assembled on the bridge; he went within about ten yards from them: one of the persons presented his piece at him: by the flash of the pan he could see that it was a firelock. One of the party on the bridge called out, “Who comes there?” Witness answered “What are you doing there?” No answer was made by the mob, but a firing commenced from them immediately, without anything more being said. It came from the centre of the bridge; it was so dark, that he could not state what the direction of the firing was. Witness could not speak to any of the other pieces; five shots were fired before he turned his horse’s head round to go back; all the firing was from the bridge. This witness was moving down in a straight line to the bridge, until he halted, when he was opposite to it at the foot. After he had commenced a retreat, other shots were fired. David Alexander was in the rear of the witness, and within a yard of his horse; he was coming in the same direction, until he halted; and the rest of the party were a little behind; there were upwards of <em>four hundred</em> persons assembled. The house of George Dawson was about 10 or 15 yards from the bridge; witness was within 10 yards of it; Dawson’s house was behind him to the right, and descended from the road by a few steps; witness was nearly in a line with Dawson’s house. The next morning he examined a house on the roadside, near the bridge, which appeared to him to have been struck by a bullet, part of the stone and lime having been driven off; it was the house adjoining Dawson’s but nearer the bridge: the mark of the ball was nearly in the direction of it. Alexander was on his right hand, within about six or seven yards of the house.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined by Mr. Williams. He said he had made diligent search after the persons supposed to be assembled on the bridge, and he ascertained that from forty to fifty persons had absconded, for some of whom he was making search, and against whom he had grounds of suspicion. Witness might be ten yards from the bridge when the first firing took place; no obstruction between him and the bridge; he observed stone walls on each side the road as he advanced to the bridge; the width of the road was less than eight yards; there are some houses which form part of eight yards; there are some houses which form part of the line to the bridge. Witness rode a bay horse. Alexander’s horse was a grey, which he supposed would be better to see in the dark than his horse, and that nothing was so likely to be seen by the party on the bridge. It was impossible to observe in what direction the firing was, or in what position the guns were pointed. Witness was the prosecutor in another indictment against the prisoners: was before the Grand Jury twice, once on a bill for shooting at himself, which was thrown out.</p>
<p>Witness was re-examined by Mr. Scarlett. Did not know whether the cavalry had their swords drawn, but they had their pistols out; witness could not say whether the persons on the bridge might have seen his party by the flash of the gun. The firing was after the conversation he had stated. The stone walls are only of the height of four or five feet, and are on lower ground than the road. Alexander’s horse was as likely as anything to mark where his party was.</p>
<p><em>David Alexander</em> is one of the Yeomanry Cavalry, was such on the 8th of June last, and was one of the party who went to Engine Bridge; had a pistol in his hand; rode a grey horse; was a little in advance of his party; and when he got within a few yards of the bridge he saw a number of men there, which induced him to halt—there appeared to be between sixty and seventy; none of them, he thought, were dressed in light-coloured clothes. Capt. Armitage ordered the constable to advance. Witness saw a piece presented, which flashed in the pan. They (the persons on the bridge) said, “Who comes there?” This was asked before the constable spoke; who said, “What do you want there?” The next thing that he saw was a flash; he could not tell whether it came from a gun or pistol. Another piece went off; it came from the end of the bridge where the mob were standing. Several more pieces were fired: his horse reeled backwards about the time the third shot was fired. After several shots had been fired, his party retreated. Witness went out again, after they got to Huddersfield; but on their arrival at Engine Bridge, the mob had dispersed.— Witness, on his return to Huddersfield the second time, examined his horse, and found that it was wounded in the forehead with a ball, which was extracted: it was a lead pistol ball, which witness produced, and was sworn to by the Court and Jury. He could not tell what it had been fired from. Witness, on the following day, examined the houses near the bridge, one of which had the appearance of being struck by a ball, a small piece of stone and lime having been knocked out: could see no appearance of the lead. This mark was two yards or eight feet above the level of the road: would be about the same height as his head when he was on horseback. At the time he observed his horse to reel his head was towards the bridge. When he examined his horse he found the blood running down his forehead: first knew that his horse was wounded after he got back the first time; saw the wound, and the ball which was taken out of its head. On his party retiring from Engine Bridge, there were some shots fired after them. The uniform is blue, turned up with buff.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined by Mr. STARKIE. He said he thought it was impossible for a stone to have produced the mark on the house near the bridge; a large stone would have made a greater hole, and a small stone could not have been thrown with sufficient force: the mark was also round. Witness was not the first to discover that his horse was wounded; it was pointed out to him. There was other firing that night, but it was at the distance of one mile and a half. Witness was not the first to discharge his pistol; did not fire it until the third shot: is sure that he did not fire first. He fired his pistol when he was at the distance of about twenty yards. His horse could not have been wounded from his own shot; he fired his pistol about the same time that he felt his horse to reel. His horse had been accustomed to stand fire. but had not been in action before. Witness was fired at between the bridge and Huddersfield.</p>
<p>In answer to a question from the Judge, he said he had been fired at before he went to Engine Bridge, between the bridge and Huddersfield. About a quarter past eleven o’clock he was going for his horse; he put the bridle on after that; is sure the horse was not wounded when he left Huddersfield.</p>
<p><em>Nathan Taylor</em> lives at Well Green, a quarter of a mile from Huddersfield: is a married man and a householder. On Sunday, the 8th of June, he went to bed about ten o’clock, and was called up again about one o’clock by some men who were calling and making a noise at the door: they said if he did not get up immediately, they would break it open. Witness then got up and opened the door, and found two men standing there; they had each of them a gun; they insisted on the witness immediately dressing himself; they came into the inside of the house and told him he was to go with them; he asked them several times “Where to,” but they would not tell him. His wife then asked them, and they said they were going to take him to Huddersfield; the witness did not ask for what purpose; he dressed himself, but did not go voluntarily; he went very much against his will; he accompanied these two men. Before they left the house, there was a call from Well Green; witness believes Benjamin Lockwood was one of the two persons. He went with them three-quarters of a mile, to a place called Knowl Hill; when he got to Knowl Lane, he found three or four persons in a field which lies between Yew Green and Engine Bridge. This field was about a quarter of a mile from the bridge, and lies near the road, on the left hand, between Lockwood and Huddersfield, and about a quarter of a mile from Engine Bridge; when he got there, between twelve and one o’clock, he went up to the men; one of them had a gun; he did not see any other guns; saw two scythes under a wall, about 12 yards from the men; they were not in the possession of any of them. William Crowther and witness made their escape, and he knows no more about the business.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined by Mr. STARKIE:— He said he could not safely swear that the prisoner, Lockwood, was one of the persons who came to his house, as it was dark.</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. TOPPING. - Walked with the two persons three quarters of a mile to Knowl Field. Being asked whether, on his examination, he had not spoken more positively, he said he had been told that Lockwood had confessed. In his evidence given today, he had said he <em>believed</em> that Lockwood was one of the men; he would not swear that he was one of them. “I think it is him; I cannot swear it is him.” Lockwood was a cropper at Woodhouse; lives a quarter of a mile from the witness; has known him personally about a year; has seen Lockwood up and down in Woodhouse, and frequently at the tenters.— Witness is a shoemaker.</p>
<p><em>George Armytage</em> examined by Mr. SCARLETT.— Is a shoemaker: knows Engine Bridge. On the 8th of June, witness had been to Lockwood “<em>a-courting</em>,” and was returning to Huddersfield between twelve and one o’clock. When he came near Engine Bridge, he was stopped by two men who presented a gun at him; a young man (Charles Hearnshaw) was with him; two guns were presented at them; the men said, “come over into the field”; the other chap said, “what to do?” They answered that they wanted to see how many they could muster that night. Hearnshaw said to the witness, “Must we, Armytage?” The men then replied, “if you do not come over, we will shoot you”; they then forced witness and his companion over the wall and drove them up the field; it was then a quarter past twelve o’clock. They found a crowd of people; there were two handkerchiefs upon the wall, which appeared to have something in them; the people made answer and said, “you that have arms, come close to the wall”; saw some persons with arms; some had guns and some had pistols; cannot say how many, but he saw eight or nine guns and pistols; some of the people went to the wall; and he saw a man put his hand into a handkerchief and take out a square lump, which he gave to a man, who, when he came away, said, “He had got twelve rounds.”</p>
<p>[This examination was interrupted by the Counsel for the prisoners, who contended that they could not enter into evidence of what was done at this place until they had proved the prisoners were there. The narrative was then suspended by examining the witness as to this fact, who said that he saw John Wilson, George Woffenden, Benjamin Lockwood, and the other prisoner, Jysop, whose name he did not then know, on the field or the bridge.] Witness proceeded, and repeated, that one man got a square lump, and said he had got twelve rounds. Did not see what was in the handkerchiefs; there was a lump as large as his hat in each of them; those who had arms went towards the wall: knows Joseph Croft. He was at the bridge:— when they had done in the field, some of them said they must go down to the other people, and they went down the hill to the bridge. Witness and Earnshaw wished to go away but were prevented, and they went to the bridge to pass over, but were stopped by two men who stood at the end of the bridge with scythes and guarded it to keep any person from going over. Jysop was one of the men who had scythes at the foot of the bridge. Joseph Croft appeared to have the command; he told them to kneel down, and the men who had arms were ranged on each side of the road, and they knelt on their right knee, opposite each other; this was upon the bridge, and their faces were turned towards Huddersfield. George Woffenden and Benjamin Lockwood had guns; John Wilson had something in his hand, but at first, he did not see what it was. When the men were kneeling, the cavalry came up; he heard the sound of the horses’ feet. Croft called out, “Who comes there?” and then cried, fire.— Witness was not upon the bridge at that time; he heard the people say there were five of the cavalry; witness was then running away towards Lockwood; one single gun went off first, and then there were a great many fired. Woffenden and Wilson had each of them guns and were upon the bridge; Jysop had a scythe upon the bridge; he was there before the firing commenced; did not see Wilson have a pistol until the people were dispersing, about 25 yards from the bridge when a gun went off at the top of Taylor Hill. One of the party said, have you nothing to answer it with? on which, Wilson fired his pistol off; this was about five minutes after they had left the bridge. Witness said he returned to Lockwood, intending to go again to his sweetheart, but she would not open the door.— Witness lives at Huddersfield, but he did not like to go there that night.</p>
<p>Witness was cross-examined at great length by Mr. WILLIAMS; he said he was a shoemaker; knows Knowl-Hill, which is the field he has been mentioning: when he saw these four men, he did not see them in that field; saw John Wilson in the field, three of them he did not see that night until he went to the bridge; he was guarded down to it by a body of men and went against his will— he was going to Huddersfield, and when he got to the crown of the bridge, two men prevented him from going over; they made a guard upon it by two scythes. For anything that the witness knows, the four persons of whom he had spoken might have been compelled to join the people on the bridge, as well as the witness and his companion Earnshaw, who was also detained against his will. Earnshaw and himself have been together a good deal since that time, were in custody five weeks were a week in the Castle, witness has not had handcuffs on; both he and Earnshaw came out of the Castle that morning— he has had no conversation with Earnshaw on the subject— does not know whether the cavalry or the party on the bridge fired first, the single piece was first fired. <em>Witness never said to anyone that he knew none of the people in the field</em>, and never heard a word of the meeting until he was stopped upon the bridge: he remembers the 13th regiment of dragoons coming to Huddersfield, he did not go to look at them,but was there, at the corner of the market place. Witness does not know whether he saw Wm. Stanley on that occasion; but he did not say to him that day, “that he (the witness) was not there (ar Engine Bridge);” said something about the grass in his father’s field being trodden down—does not recollect any person saying to him “thou must have been there Goerge,” nor does he recollect saying “no” or “I was not there.” After the question had been repeated several times he said he could not say whether he had said so or not. Being asked if he had not talked at Huddersfield about his father’s field being trodden down , he said he could not answer that.Being asked if he did not say, “By G-d, I was not there— said he could not recollect saying such a word.— When much pressed he said he did not say, by G-d, and does not recollect saying the rest of the sentence: He however would not positively swear that he did not say it; he knows that there is a person named Blaydes at Huddersfield, but does not know him, nor that he said these words in his presence; if he did, they have slipped his memory; neither does he ever recollect saying them. Witness knows James Drake; he did tell him that he had been there, but he did not say he knew any man that was there, for he was afraid of being shot. He gave the information at last to the Magistrates because he always meant to tell of the people.</p>
<p><em>Capt. Armitage</em> was again called and stated, that he was quite sure the first firing was from the party on the bridge.</p>
<p>This finished the evidence on the part of the Crown.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Wood said this was the time for the prisoners to make their defence.</p>
<p>The prisoners said they left their defence to their counsel.</p>
<p>The following witnesses were then called on their behalf:–</p>
<p>The Prisoners said they left their defence to their Council. The following witnesses were then called on their behalf:—</p>
<p><em>Mr. Wm. Stanley</em> lives at Huddersfield, is a shoe-maker; remembers the dragoons coming into Huddersfield, it rained at the time, and he retired into a passage for shelter; it was the day after the disturbances; Blaydes, and a publican of the name of Dunn, were there, and three other persons he did not know. The passage is near the market-place; he knows Geo. Armytage, (the last witness for the prosecution,) very well, and has known him from a child; whilst he was standing, Armytage came into the passage—there was some conversation about the disturbances the preceding day, and about the dragoons coming into the town; when Armytage said, “his father’s field was trodden down, and there was hardly a blade of grass standing;” he said there were many hundreds upon it. Witness said to him, “George, did thou see them?” Armytage replied, “No I did not see them.” and here the conversation ended with Armytage; and the witness then talked with the other persons.</p>
<p><em>James Drake</em> stated that he was a cloth dresser at Huddersfield; had some conversation with George Armytage, on the Froday following the disturbances, about three o’clock in the afternoon, in Mr. Downing’s stables; there was another young man present at the same time, who lives with Mr. Downing, of the name of Reynolds; they were talking about what had happened at Engine Bridge, when George Armytage said, <em>“he did not know one person that was there.”</em></p>
<p>Witness on his cross-examination said that he was a cloth-dresser, and lived at Huddersfield, was not intimate with Armytage; he told him he had been courting a young woman, and on coming back was forced into a field, and told him what he had seen; he said he turned back as soon as he could, and when he had got a distance from them, he heard a few pieces go off. Armytage told him this as a secret, and he was not to mention it to any one; he did not tell the witness his reason for keeping it a secret; he did not say it was for fear of being shot, or that he was afraid of being shot. Witness said he knew his reason, which was, that he was afraid of being taken up. Witness communicated this conversation to his father on the following day. Mr. Alexander, the attorney for the prisoner, sent for him the last Friday but one, and he then told him of it: he also told it to many persons besides his father. After Armytage was taken into custody, he knew he was to be a witness; knows John Wilson, has known him five or six years; supposes Wilson’s father, or some other person, had heard what he could say, and had communicated it to Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p>Witness, on his re-examination, said he did not promise to keep it a secret, and that Armytage did not seem to be under any apprehension, and that he was quite hardened.</p>
<p><em>John Blaydes</em> is a tailor, at Huddersfield; he lives at the bottom end of the town; saw Armytage in the market-place; was in the passage, remembers George Armytage coming in, 8 or 10 persons were taking shelter in it. The persons there were talking about the disturbances, witness took no part in the conversation; he heard Armytage say that he had been at his father’s field, (which he supposes to be at Engine Bridge) he said they had made such work among the grass as was shameful to be seen; he said, he believed there had been between three or four hundred people in the field; witness said, upon hearing this, W. Stanley made a remark and asked him if he had been there, he said “no he would be d———d if he had been there;” he said nothing more that he knew of.</p>
<p>On being cross-examined, witness said he heard of Armytage being taken up, but does not recollect the time when he first heard of it; is sure that Wm. Stanley said, thou hast been there thyself George, and that his answer was that he had not been there.</p>
<p><em>Mr. James Woodhouse</em> has known Benjamin Lockwood five years, his character was very good, he was 19 years of age, and was apprentice with the witness.</p>
<p><em>Eli Dyson</em> lives at Well-Green, has known George Woffenden ten years and upwards; his general character has been very good; he was a sober young man, avoided had company, attended religious worship, paying due respect to his mother; his father being dead from his infancy. Being asked by the Counsel if his conduct had been good towards all others of his Majesty’s subjects? he answered, it had— his general conduct had been good.</p>
<p><em>Mr. John Thornton</em> had known George Woffenden ever since he was born, and during the whole time he always considered him as a good, honest, sober lad, very peaceable, and was never found in a fray before. Has served witness and his brother five or six years.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Wm. Milnes</em> has also known the prisoner Woffenden ever since he was born, and he really deserves the character given him; he never knew him in an affray before.</p>
<p><em>Edward Dixon</em> has known John Wilson ever since he was born, his character is good, has been dutiful from his childhood, and is a peacable, well-behaved young man.</p>
<p><em>Mr. John Blaydes</em> has known Wilson since he was a child, has heard the character given him by the last witness, which he deserves and his general character was very good all through Huddersfield.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron WOOD proceeded to charge the Jury. He said this was an indictment against the prisoners charging them with aiding and abetting a person unknown in discharging a gun, or other fire-arms, at David Alexander, with intent to kill, maim, disable, or do some other grievous bodily harm to the said David Alexander. His Lordship said, it had been clearly proved that there had been some very grievous outrages committed on this occasion: that a great number of persons armed had collected together, at the place spoken to by the witnesses, for a purpose which had not been stated in evidence but which could not be otherwise than illegal; and he thought it was the duty of the government to institute a legal inquiry into these transactions. His Lordship also said, that he agreed in the law, as laid down by the Counsel for the prosecution, that it was not necessary to prove either that the prisoners were any of them the <em>(sic)</em> had that fired the gun, or that the person who fired it had an intention to shoot the individual named in the indictment. It was sufficient to establish the charge, if the prisoners were proved to be unlawfully assembled with the person that fired the gun; and, by that presence, were aiding and assisting the person so firing. And if it was fired with the intention of killing, or of doing any grievous bodily harm to any of his Majesty’s subjects, it might be considered as being the intention to kill or disable the person named in the indictmnent. If a person wilfully discharged a gun among a body people, without singling out any one individual may be considered and laid as fired with an intent to kill, maim, or disable all or any of them. But deciding upon the case before the Jury, they would consider whether the prisoners were present on that occasion: and that was the main question the Jury would have to try; because if they were there voluntarily they must be considered as concurring in all the acts that were done at that assemblage. His Lordship then proceeded to detail the evidence, as given in the preceding statement; having concluded, he said, the tumultuous assemblage and the firing, were sufficiently proved; but there were only two witnesses who at all brought the charge home to any of the prisoners: the first of these, Taylor, spoke to the person of Benjamin Lockwood; but on his evidence it would be impossible for the Jury safely to rely with respect to this prisoner, because the witness would not take upon him to say positively that he was one of the persons who called upon him, and though the Counsel for the prosecution endeavoured to show, by cross-examination, that he must have well known the prisoner, still, if the Jury should be convinced that he did not speak the truth, when he said, he was not sure that he was the person— whose reliance could they place upon his saying, that he believed he was the person? If his testimony was false in the former case, it would be unworthy of credit in the latter. The whole of the case then against the prisoners rested upon the unsupported testimony of witness George Armytage, whose credit had been materially shaken by the evidence of respectable witnesses on the part of the prisoners. This witness had repeatedly denied having made certain declarations respecting this transaction, which he was clearly proved to have made, and of which he could not be ignorant: and this was the only evidence of the prisoners having been at Engine Bridge, where this meeting was held. It would be for the Jury to say whether they could convict the prisoners upon it. There was another circumstance deserving of the serious consideration of the Jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness: he had been in the custody of the prosecutors; he was then at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present and to have seen all the circumstances that he had asserted in evidence, and yet he is not produced. The Jury would draw their own inference from this strong fact. His Lordship thought it was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness. His Lordship further stated that if, in considering the evidence, the Jury thought it a matter of reasonable doubt, the good character given the prisoners should incline the scale in their favour. It was a case which deserved their serious consideration; and he had no doubt that their verdict would be such as the justice of the case required.</p>
<p>The Jury retired for about a quarter of an hour and, on their return into Court, pronounced all the prisoners— NOT GUILTY.</p>
<p><em>The Judge</em>— “Prisoners at the bar, Take care of yourselves for the future. Youi have now had a very narrow estape, and if you persist in such practices as these, you may depend upon it you will bring yourselves to an untimely end. Have a care of your future Conduct.”</p>

<p>Given the failure of both prosecution cases, an editorial comment was very much called for, highlighting the State’s zeal in mounting a prosecution, but arguing that it was not by any means demonstrating a process of “fair” justice.</p>
<p>Remark was also made of a witness to the events at Folly Hall bridge, who was available at Yrok, bit was not presented: a certain Mr. Charles Hearnshaw:</p>

<p>Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817</p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="the-mercury">THE MERCURY.</h3>
<p>The trials of the <em>State prisoners</em>, as they have been pompously called, closed at York last Saturday; and the four-and-twenty persons against whom the Government solicitor was instructed to institute prosecutions, ten have been pronounced not guilty; against eleven others no bills were found; and one has been liberated on bail; leaving only two in the whole number in Confinement, and those two unfortunate men have been detained, without trial, by a Secretary of State’s warrant, under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Thus ends the Yorkshire plot!</p>
<p>The failure of these prosecutions has not been owing to any want of zeal, or deficiency of means, on the part of the Government. Some time before the trials came on, the Solicitor for the Crown was sent down into the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, to collect evidence against the prisoners;— in support of this evidence, a large portion of the weight and talent of the bar, on the northern circuit, was ranged on the side of the prosecution— and that nothing might be wanting to give importance to these proceedings, Mr. GURNEY was sent down from London, at the expense of Government, to take reports of the trials, for the perusal, we presume, of his Majesty’s Ministers. Against all this weight of power and influence, seconded by the public purse, a few obscure men and boys, principally in the very lowest ranks in society, had to defend themselves. The odds were terrific; but with the zeal and intelligence of their professional advisers and advocates, and the presiding presence of a righteous Judge, who knows no distinction between the lofty and the humble, in the administration of justice, the trial by Jury obtained another distinguished triumph, and the prisoners, after a period of deep anxiety, were restored to their liberty and to their friends.</p>
<p>While we speak of the <em>zeal</em> manifested by the persons officially engaged in the trials of the prisoners, we cannot but regret that the Judge should have had occasion complain, in the presence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Haigh, the committing magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the magistrates required, till had made particular inquiry for them. The upright mind of Baron Wood, it was evident, felt wounded by this proceeding, and any thing like reluctance to give to the accused all the advantages any discrepancy between the original examination of a witness and his evidence before the Court, will always be viewed with suspicion by a people jealous of their privileges, and anxious in the highest degree to preserve the stream of public justice free from contamination. The apology made for this suspicious omission by Mr. Le Blanc, the solicitor for the Crown, must be felt by every lover of justice to be extremely unsatisfactory. Some of the examinations, he says, were not taken on oath: but that surely is no reason why the others should be withheld!—and why, we should be glad to know, were examinations involving the liberty and lives of many of our countrymen not taken in the usual and authorised way? Mr. Allison, the clerk to the Huddersfield magistrates, and the professional coadjutor of the Crown solicitor in these prosecutions, might have instructed Mr. Allen’s inexperience. Though his modesty may not allow it, the people of Huddersfield, and the professional gentlemen of the county of York, well know that there are few gentlemen in their profession better acquainted with the duties of a magistrate’s law-clerk, or who has had more experience in criminal matters, than Mr. Allison. If our memory does not fail us, this gentleman acted as law-clerk to Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Radcliffe, during the whole of the disturbances in 1812, when no fewer than 64 persons were committed to York-castle, and when 17 of that number were capitally convicted. Inexperience, therefore, is out of the question; but supposing this to have been the case, the public will naturally inquire, whether Mr. Le Blanc is also inexperienced? and why he who had the chief direction of the prosecution did not order the depositions to be laid before the Judge? These documents were, however tardily, at length produced, and the penetrating eye of Baron Wood soon discovered that Samuel Winpenny had sworn one thing before the magistrates, and another before the Court; and this contradiction on a point of essential importance was very properly deemed by his Lordship fatal to the witness’s testimony.</p>
<p>As to the conduct of the Government, in instituting these prosecutions, if we had not substantial reason for believing that the crimes imputed to the prisoners were instigated by a spy agency, which first entraps and then betrays, we should have held the prosecutions to be extremely laudable. That nothing appeared on the trials to couple Mr. Oliver’s name with these lawless transactions is true, and for the best possible reason— it was the policy and the interest of both parties to keep that pestiferous agent out of sight. The prosecutors would not, of course, introduce him to the notice of the Jury; and the counsel for the prisoners, while it was their duty to maintain that their clients were free from guilt, necessarily avoided the slightest mention of any union between the accused and the reputed instigator of the crimes with which they stood charged. The situation of both parties will, therefore, satisfactorily account for the perfect silence that prevailed respecting Mr. Oliver; but had it been necessary to show, by evidence, that this Spy had been in communication with the leaders of the sedition, and that he had “aided, counselled, and comforted” them, that evidence was at hand.</p>
<p>We readily admit that the offences clearly proved to have been committed in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th of June, called for legal investigation: but, while we deprecate popular tumult and violence, in every shape, and call for punishment upon the lawless, we shall always, in the benign spirit of the English law, claim for the accused candour and fair-dealing on the part of the public prosecutor. <em>Justice</em>, rather than <em>Conviction</em>, ought to be the object of the Government, and of all the persons acting under their directions and authority.</p>
<p>We have been led into these observations by a circumstance of a very extraordinary nature that has come to our knowledge, and which bears a striking affinity the case of McKinle, so recently before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh: but before we proceed to state the facts to which we allude, it may be proper, for the perfect understanding of the subject, to quote the words of Baron Wood, in his charge to the Jury, on the trial of Benjamin Lockwood and others, for maliciously, shooting at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield yeomanry cavalry, on the night the 8th of June. After adverting to the testimony George Armytage, one of the witnesses for the Crown, who had sworn that he and a person of the name of Earnshaw, or Hearnshaw, had been forced to join the rioters at Folly-hall-bridge, his Lordship said—— “There is another circumstance deserving the serious consideration of the jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness. He has been in the custody of the prosecutors; he is now at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present, and to have seen all the circumstances that Armytage has asserted in evidence; and yet he is not produced! The Jury will draw their own inferences from this strong fact. It was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness.”</p>
</div>
<p><em>The McKinley case, relating to the administering of oaths, ended with a “Not proven” verdict from the jury, not least because at least two key witness testimonies were rejected: one for being paid for, the other becuase it was based on what had been read in the newspapers.</em></p>

<p>Morning Herald (London) - Thursday 24 July 1817</p>
<p>HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY, JULY 19</p>
<p>THE KING V. ANDREW McKINLEY, FOR ADMINISTERING UNLAWFUL OATHS.</p>
<p>The Court having, yesterday, determined on the relevancy of the Indictment, it met again this monrng <em>(sic)</em>, and proceeded to the trial of the prisoner, when the interlocutor for the relevancy of the Indictment being read,</p>
<p>The ADVOCATE rose and addressed the Court, and stated, that, from the decision of previous day, the persons accused of the crime libelled had placed their lives in the full effect of the penalty of the law; but he thought he should be following only the beneficent views of the Government if he restricted the punishment to an arbitrary one. He then entered into a defence of his conduct on this occasion, and accused the Counsel on the opposite side of charging him with a desire to take away the life of the prisoner. This he denied, and averred that be only sought what was maintained in every Act of Parliament passed for the safety of the country. He vindicated, at the same time, the necessity for passing the Acts which at different times had been enacted for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act; and concluded by saying, that having never acted from any selfish motive, he despised the endeavours which had been made to lower him in the esteem of the Parliament or the public.</p>
<p>Mr. GRANT on the part of the panel, and made some spirited remarks on the speech of the Lord Advocate, particularly on the assertion formerly made of the Bar having entered into a combination to defend the prisoner.</p>
<p>After a few words from the LORD ADVOCATE in reply, the interlocutor, restricting the punishment to an arbitrary one, was read, and a most respectable Jury sworn. The first witness called was,</p>
<p>Robert Hamilton, Esq. Sheriff Depute of Lanarkshire. He proved the declarations of the pannel taken before, him. The declarations were then read. The first stated that he had been 14 years a private in the volunteers, and always did his duty; that he never heard of any association for overturning the Government by force, and that he never was at any meeting held for this purpose; that the meetings he was present at were only for the purpose of attending to the amelioration of the poor-rates. The 2d, that he was present at different meetings, the object of which he could not very well describe, but that they were principally concerning the poor rates; that he did not wish to disclose the names of the persons in whose houses the meetings took place, for fear of their losing their licenses. The 3d, that the object of all the meetings was merely the amelioration of the poor rates; and that the meetings were all public, and that every person wishing to aid in carrying this into effect were welcome to attend them, and that during his attendance nothing political was ever brought forward. 4th. After being admonished by the Sheriff to be aware of disclosing any thing against himself, he stated that he was afraid he bad been led away; that he understood that a club existed in Glasgow, consisting of gentlemen who would assist them in their plans; that an oath of secrecy was signed by those who became members of the society.</p>
<p>John Campbell, a prisoner in the Castle of Edinburgh, was then called, when Mr. JEFFRAY ohjected to his giving his evidence, as the prisoner’s agent was denied all comaumication with him, and in effect that the prisoner had been denied all the benefit which he had a right to from this communication; the Governor of the Castle, in answer to the demand by the Counsel for the prisoner, having stated that he had not the power of allowing any person to see the person named. Mr. Jeffrey also stated, that the idendity of this witness could not be proved, as both the civil and military power had retnsed all intercourse with him. He contended that the prisoner had every right to refuse the testimony of this witness, as he never had an opportunity of ascertaining whether the John Campbell in the list delivered him was the John Campbell who could appear against him. Mr. Jeffray contended, at great length, on the right which the prisoner had, by his Counsel or agent, to converse with the witnesses cited against him, and in consequence of this being refused by the Public Prosecutor, as well as the Governor of the Castle, in whose custody those witnesses were; and concluded by hoping the Court would not allow the witness to he called.</p>
<p>Mr. H DRUMMOND contended, that Mr. Jeffray’s objection as to the identity of the witness was futile, as he could not prove there were any more John Campbells in the Castle of Edinburgh. He contended, that the duty of the prisoner’s Counsel, if they had any objection to make with respect to their deprivation of access to the witnesses confined in the Castle, they ought to have brought it in a previous stage of the business, as it was not a new thing for witnesses to be confined by order of the Court of Justiciary in the Castle of Edinburgh, to prevent them from being tampered with.</p>
<p>The LORD ADVOCATE said, when the persons alluded to were first imprisoned, he had distiuctly stated, that he desired that the names of persons who wished to sse them, or whom they might wish to see, should be handed to him, when he would either give his consent to their admission or refuse it, leaving these persons to apply to the Court if they found themselves aggrieved.</p>
<p>Mr. JEFFRAY contended, that he had every right to bring fotwurd any objection which appeared to him of importance, to prevent the testimony of any witness which he might think detrimental to his client. He therefore said, that he had a right to do this at any stage of the trial he pleased. He again contended, on the impossibility of the prisoner in identifying the witness, and therefore that he could or ought not to be admitted to give evidence. He stated also, that that the Lord Advocate had given a peremptory refusal to the admiision of the prisoner’s Counsel or Agent to the persons confined without an order from the Crown Agent. He contended further, that the Lord Advocate had no power to prevent access to the persons whom the pannel had a right to see and converse with; and that he had suffered gteatly, or was likely to suffer very much, by the privilege he had a full and complete right to being denied him.</p>
<p>Mr. CLERK followed’ on the same side at considerable length. His arguments turned chiefly on the impossibility of the pannel identifying the person of the witness, and therefore he considered him as altogether incompetent to be examined.</p>
<p>The Court having taken the objection into consideration, they agreed that proof should be given of the refusal of the Lord Advocate to grant admission to the witnesses confined in the Castle, which was objected to by the Lord Advocate, without a distinct charge to this effect should be entered on the record. This being done, the Lord Advocate read a written statement, exactly the same as he had before verbally stated. A letter was then read from the Crown Agent, in answer to an application for admission to the witnesses, denying such admission in the most positive terms. Repeated applications, it appeared, were afterwards made, but received the same answer.</p>
<p>The Court having resumed consideration of the objection, Lord GILLIES observed, that he thought the designation of the witness sufficiently stated in the list of witnesses; but he thought at the same time, that the refusal of the Lord Advocate and Crown Agent, for any intercourse between the prisoner and the witnesses in the Castle, without any reason assigned, was detrimental to the case of the prisoner At the same time, he thought the prisoner’s Counsel had been guilty of neglect, in not advising him at the proper time to apply to the Court for admission to the Castle, who would certainly have granted the permission required.</p>
<p>Lord PITMILLY and Lord RESTON delivered their opinions to nearly the same effect; and concluded by stating, this was not the time for starting such an objection.</p>
<p>The LORD JUSTICE CLERK was of the same opinion. The objection was of course repelled; when the witness was called in and sworn.</p>
<p>John Campbell—On the usual interrogatory being put to him, it he had received any tee or reward for the evidence he was to give, he answered, that <em>he had</em>.</p>
<p>The LORD JUSTICE CLERK then cautioned witness respecting the evidence he was to give, and he being perfectly freed from any trial connected with his share in the transactions, which produced this trial.</p>
<p>The Witness then addressed the Court, and stated his sense of the obligation of an oath; that he knew he must answer to GOD for what he said before this Court, and offered to lay before the Court the names of those persons, who had come forward to offer this reward.</p>
<p>He was then asked by the LORD JUSTICE CLERK, what were the grounds for his giving the answer to the question above mentioned?— Ans. He was apprehended along with the prisoner on the 22d of February. last, without cause assigned, or without a warrant; was called upon on the Thursday or Wednesday following, and was examined before the Sheriff Depute of Lanarkshire, and asked if he knew what he was brought before him for? told the Sheriff he did not. The Sheriff insisted that he did, and that it would be wisdom in him to make his breast clean.— After some similar conversation, the Sheriff left him alone with Mr. Salmon (the Procurator Fiscal), when Mr. Salmon came up to him and said, “John, perhaps you do not know that I know so much about this affair?” and added, “I know more about it than you think I do; you do not know that I have the oath you took at Leggatt’s on the 1st of Januaary.” He then shewed him a scroll of an oath, saying, “You see, John, I have got it.” He then added, “You and other persons (whom he named), took that oath at Leggatt’s on the 1st of January.” Witness then told him that he had not taken that oath. Witness had expressed his wish not to enter into any description of the ill usage, threats, and stratagems, practised upon him by the Sheriff of Lanarkshtre to induce him to become a witness by torturing him with the same questions, couched in different tetros, which the Court agreeing to, he proceeded to state that after several examinations, and being closeted with Mr Salmon, one of these times, he cannot say at what date, Mr. Salmon (after using many entreaties, and these having failed) began railing against the prisoners as villains who had betrayed the witness: he said that it only his regard for witness that made him wish him to become an evidence—said then to him “I assure you I have six men who will swear you took that oath, and you are as sure to be hanged as you are in life.”— Witness told him that if he got six men to swear he took that oath, they would perjure themselves. He replied, that it might be possible to get two or three persons to perjure themselves, but he did not think it was possible to get six to do so. After he said to witness “you will ruin yourself if you take this way, but if you take the other way you may do yourself much good.” After much conversation he stated that saw nothing he had to apprehend from the one way, and no good that was to come from the other. Mr. Salmon said that the Lord Advocate was in Glasgow, and that he would come under any obligation he (witness) chose if he would be a witness. Shortly after this he was taken back to the Sheriff’s room, when Mr. Drummond, Advocate Depute, came in, when he examined him, but the subject of the obligation was not then mentioned, and he was a few days afterwards sent to Edinburgh Castle. Some time after he came to the Castle he was visited by Mr Drummond, who stated to him that McKinley was served with his indictment, and that his name was in the list of witnesses. and now was the time for him to determine whether to become a witness or not; this he refused, saying, that if he did so he need not return to Glasgow. His reply was, that he might go to another town and change his name. Witness said he would change his name on no account; that it would be much the same if he lived in any other manufacturing town as in Glasgow. Mr. Drummond then stated that he had been thinking of a plan to writing to Lord Sidmouth to get him into the Excise; and that if witness chose he would write to Lord Sidmouth, and would shew him the answer he received. Witness answered, he did not choose the office of an exciseman, and remarked at the same time, that it was perhaps the only office under Government that he was capable for; but as it was an office which was generally attended with risk and ill-will, he did not choose to accept it, as he had already suffered considerably in that way as a peace officer. No person was present at this conversation, but Mr. Drummond had been with him several times in the Castle. Mr. Drummond asked, on one of these what witness wanted to have? when he remained silent, Mr. Drummond then stated, that if he would give every information, and if that information pleased the Lord Advocate, he would neither be called on as a witness, nor be tried. He then stated that it was a very uncertain matter; that he did not know what information they wanted, or whether they were not already in possession of all the information he was able to give; and that if his information did not please the Lord Advocate, he would be open to every attack they might choose to make upon him, Mr. Drummond then replied, “I do not know what to do with you; you see I am inclined to favour you as much as in my power; I shall give you a day or two think of it. Do you wish I should call back again?” After some hesitation, witness replied, he might do as he pleased. Mr. Drummond then left him; he called again a few days afterwards, when he said, “Now, Campbell, this is the last time; you must be determined now.” He then asked it he written to Lord Sidmouth, and was answered no, as witness had rejected the offer. He was then asked if he had made up his mind; when he an that he had upon conditions, which were that he should receive a passport to go to the Continent; when he was told by Mr. Drummond that he supposed there was nobody could stop him. He answered, that being a mechanic he did not believe the laws of the country would allow him to quit it. Mr. D. replied with a smile, is that all? There is no question but you will get that, and means to carry eon there. Witness then said, that on these conditions he was willing to become a witness, if his wife was included. Mr. D. replied, let us understand each other properly, for I should not wish to have any misunderstanding between us at the latter end. He then told him he believed witness had received a letter from his father, when, after some conversation, the situation of his wife was spoken of, when he stated to Mr. Drummond that his wife was in delicate health, and had nothing but what she earned; and he was apprehensive that, if it was known that he was to be a witness, the public might manifest their displeasure by ill will to her. Mr. Drummond then desired him to write to her, and to mark a <em>one pound note</em> on the letter, which he would enclose. He desired him to inform his wife that he was to be a witness, and to tell his wife to leave Glasgow and to go to witness’s father’s to stay for the present. The letter, however, was not sent, as the Lord Advocate ojected to its being sent to the person to whose care it was directed, but to direct it to Mr. Salmon. The letter, however, was not sent, but Mr. Drummond directed the money to be given to his wife in Glasgow. An examination afterwards took place in the presence of the Sheriff, Sheriff Substitute, Solicitor General, and Mr. Drummoud; the terms formerly agreed upoo, viz. that he should receive a passport for himself and wife to go to Prussia, and means afforded to convey them thither, were discussed. His reason for making these terms was, that he did not consider either himself or his wife safe in this country, should he appear as an evidence in this business. The Sheriff (Sir W. Rae) retused agree to them, and stated, as his reason For doing so, that being an officer of the Crown, it was his duty to see Justice done; and he assured the witness, that if he was to sign any such agreement, he would not be answerable for it for a good deal; for if, when he was brought to his oath as a witness, having any such agreement signed, and were to swear that he had received no reward, or promise of reward, he would perjure himself. Witness answered, “No; if it was considered the means of his preservation:” in which he was supported by Mr. Drummond; but the Sheriff persisted in his refusal to sign any such agreement; on which Mr. Drummond proposed, that the British colonies should be substituted for any other kingdom; but the Sheriff refused also to agree to this, adding, that he was willing to agree that every means necessary for the preservation of witness and his wife should be taken, but he would agree to nothing further. A pause in the conversation here took place; when, after a little, Mr. Drummond said to witness, “Now, Campbell, you know whether you can be a witness on these terms or not.” Mr. Drummond , after another pause, said, “Now, Campbell, do youbelieve we are able to do for you what you expect without its being put down on paper?” Witness answered, he knew they were able if they were willing. Mr. Drummond replied, “Could you rely upon us for that?” Witness answered, “May I?” Mr. Drummond answered, “You may.” To which witness repiied, “Then I shall rely upon you as gentlemen.” Shortly after this, witness was allowed to write his declaration himself, with the exception of one part relating to a Mr. Kerr. Some days after this the Sheriff and clerk came up to sign the declaration, when the Sheriff said to him, “Campbell, when you get rid of this business, go home to your loom, and leave them to rule the nation as they please.” To which witness replied, that if he thought he was to go back to his loom, he would rather be served with an indictment after all he had written; to which the Sheriff answered, he had nothing to do with that, it remained between witness and others. Mr. Drummond visited witness after this declaration, when he ordered the gaoler to procure plenty of books for witness to read, which he got to the amount of about one hundred volnmes. Shortly after witness wrote to Mr. Drummond for some clothes and money. Witness received a pair of shoes; but with regard to money, he was answered, he would get none till after the first trial, when he would get money; this was about three weeks ago. He wtote another letter to Mr. Drummond, stating a part of what had been put down in his declaration, as a gentle demand answers were conveyed to him by the gaoler, who told him he had them from Mr. Drummed.</p>
<p>The Court rejected this witness, as it appeared he came forward to give his evidence under the impression that he was to receive a certain remuneration, or had made an agreement to that effect.</p>
<p>Four witnesses, all prisoners in the Castle of Edinburgh, were then called in succession; they all admitted that they had attended different meetings at Glasgow, but that no oath of secresy was administered. The meetings were to consider of commencing reform societies; and as it had been hinted in the London <em>Courier</em>, that upon the meeting of Parliament the Habeas Corpus Act would be suspended, and that a very small crime might subject a person to its operation, it was necessary to provide against any member hurting his neighbour by any unguarded expression. An obligation or promise of secresy by shake of the hand was agreed upon, and confidence then took place, that no information from any other society should he used, to hurt any individual of these societies. All denied that any oath, such as stated in the indictment, was, administered; and one witness, Finlayson, declared that he would not have recollected one word of the oath of obligation had he not seen it in a newspaper, in a speech in Parliement.</p>
<p>The Court not allow this witness to be further examined on that point, as it was evident his information was derived merely from newspaper report, not from any thing within his own knowledge.</p>
<p>After examining these witnesses, the LORD ADVOCATE rose and addressed the Court, stating, that in consequence of the disappointment he had experienced in the turn which the evidence he bad adduced had taken, he found he could not receive the verdict which his former impressions had led him to expect. He therefore would not take up the valuable time of Judges and Jury in going further into a discussion which could neither be beneficial to the country nor to the panne; he therefore left it to the Jury to return a verdict of—<em>Not Proven</em> or <em>Not Guilty</em>, as they deemed mpst proper.</p>
<p>Mr. JEFFRAY paid a high compliment to the Lord Advocate and the other Counsel for the Crown, for their humane eonduct on this occasion, and stated that he had not seen an occasion on which the conduct of the Court had been directed to the maintenance of the Constitution, and the liberty of the subject, with more propriety.</p>
<p>The Jury, after consulting a few minutes in the box, returned a verdict of <em>Not Proven</em>.</p>
<p>The LORD JUSTICE CLERK then addressed the prisoner nearly as follows:—</p>
<p>“Andrcw Mackinley, in consequence of what has passed this day, a Jury of your country has returned a verdict of not proven; you have been duly tried upon the most patient investigation, and the public prosecutor has not, upon this occasion, produced evidence to find you guilty of the charges in the indictment. The evidence has-been unsatisfactory; but looking to your own declaration, and the minute given in by your Counsel, the verdict of not proven is a proper verdict. This verdict leaves, however, a mark upon your characer which nothing but a life of rectitude will wipe off. You have had a full, fair, and impartial trial. It must shew you the safeguard of a British Jury, and mot leave upon your mind a conviction of the security and happiness of the people of this country—it shows that the laws extend to their protection. You now return to society. Have no more secret meetings, either by bonds, oaths, or engagements. Abstain from such practices, and no such charge can come against you again. Hold out for the future to your fellow countrymen, that the laws afford protection to the persons of the subjects, and charge them to band down our happy Constitution unimpaite4 to the latest posterity. By your future life, justify the verdict of the Jury. If you have been misled by wicked men, be determined to live for the future in the paths of honesty, sobtiety, and virtue.”</p>
<p>Before leaving the Bar, the prisoner addressed the Court as follows:—</p>
<p>“My Lords, I am not in a capacity to stand, from my weak state of body, to return you my thanks in a long speech, but I thank your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, tor your unwearied attention in this long and arduous case; also the Lord Advocate, for his kindness to me during the time of my confinement, in admitting my friends to visit me withomit restraint. To my Counsel my feelings will not allow me to express myself.”</p>
<p>The prisoner then bowed to the Court and retired.</p>
<p>The trial lasted from nine in the morning till ten at night.</p>

<p>Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817</p>
<p>Upon this text of Mr. Baron Wood, the following declaration of Charles Hearnshaw, the witness referred to, furnishes the alarming comment: we publish the document, <em>verbatim</em>, as it has been sent to us, [with the exception of one word used sportively by the Grand Jury], chusing rather to retain even the grammatical inaccuracies, than to make any alterations in the paper itself:—</p>
<p>DECLARATION OF CHARLES HEARNSHAW</p>
<p>Transmitted for Publication from Huddersfield, on Thursday, the 31st of July, 1817:—</p>
<p>“I was examined, the 21st of June, by Mr. B. Allen, Magistrate, concerning the Folly-hall fight:— He asked if I could tell him who fir’d first? I told him the cavalry fir’d first, at the Folly Hall Bridge, on the 8th of June. Mr. Allen told me I was mistaken, it was a gun in Manchester-street that I heard. I told him it was not a gun  Manchester-street, it was the gentlemen cavalry: I was certain of it: but they would not put that in my examination. When I was going to be examined by the grand jury, at York, Mr. Thomas Atkinson came to me, and asked me, if would do him a favour? I asked him what it was? He said, he could wish me to say the mob fir’d first and bought a shilling’s worth of oranges; and he told me if did not say the mob fired first, I should have four or five evidences against me, namely, Mr. T. Atkinson, Mr. David Alexander, Mr. Allen the magistrate, and George Whitehead the constable. I told the grand jury the truth; I told them the cavalry fired first, and I told them the ball wiz’d close by my head.—They asked me if I was not afraid: I told them I was not. I told them, then, there was about eight or nine of the mob fired, and immediately the cavalry galloped off. The Grand Jury said, they was——, and laugh’d. Saturday, the 26th, a gentleman from London sent for me, Mr. Liblong, Solicitor for the Crown, I think they call’d him, and he asked me what I meant to say when I got into the Court? Itold him I meant to speak the truth; I told him I meant to say that the cavalry fir’d first. He told me I was a damned lieing rascal, and said I had had conversation with Buckley, and he had persuaded me to say so. He asked me if I could not as well say the mob fir’d first, say the cavalry fir’d first. Mr. Atkinson likewise told me Buckley had been talking to me, and had persuaded me to say the cavalry fir’d first; and, because I would not say as they wanted, I was never brought up to give my evidence in the Court; and when I made application to Mr. Allinson, the attorney, for something to carry me home, he said he had orders to give me nothing; and Matthew Bradley, clerk to Mr. Allen, said I should be pillor’d, before the 3 months’ end, if I did not mind what I was about. And this is the real truth; I am ready to attest it before any man in England.<br />
CHARLES HEARNSHAW.”</p>
<p>We have no hesitation in making the above declaration public. Of CHARLES HEARNSHAW we know nothing. We never saw the declarant in our life, nor ever held any communication with him till the information, contained in the above paper, was transmitted to us for insertion. All we know of the matter is, that it appears, from the Crown Calendar, that the magistrates, in making out the commitments, acted principally upon his information; and if it were proper that a number of our countrymen should be sent to the county gaol, and put upon their trials for their lives, on the testimony of this witness, there can be no impropriety in giving his own account of the nature of that testimony. If the assertions of this witness for the Crown are to be relied upon, he was first tampered with, then insulted, and lastly, withheld from the witness-box, because he did not choose to fashion his evidence according to the dictation of the prosecutors!</p>

<p>A brief editorial review of the trial, and the return of those accused to Huddersfield, was also provided, along with further comment:</p>

<p>Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817</p>
<p>LEEDS Saturday , Aug. 2</p>
<p>They write from Huddersfield that the reign of terror is at an end, and that in addition to the prisoners liberated from York, the eighteen men said to have been confined in a temporary prison at that place, either as rioters or witnesses, have all been liberated. On Sunday, the men and boys, amounting to twenty-two in number, who had been acquitted at York, or discharged for want of sufficient evidence to put them on their trial, were met on their approach to Huddersfield by an immense number of men, women, and children, who hailed their safe return. The scenes which were exhibited between the men and their families and the boys and their parents, at this happy meeting, we shall not pretend to describe. Whatever might be the disposition of any of the accused before they went to York, it was evident that they had availed themselves of the advice of the “righteous judge,” as they style Baron Wood, for even in this moment of exultation, there was not the least indication of tumult and excess. As to the prisoners, we are bound by the laws of our country to consider them innocent of the crimes laid to their charge, but that there has been very unjustifiable excesses in the neighbourhood must not be denied, and we hope that the persons engaged in them, will, from this moment, discard from their minds any rankling feelings of revenge or resentment for the events of past years, and conduct themselves peaceably and as becomes good subjects in time to come. If severity produced or aggravated animosity and heart-burnings which every good man must deplore, let clemency extinguish these dispositions, and cast the mantle of oblivion over scenes that ought long since to have been forgotten. Not that we would advise any portion of our countrymen to sink into a state of apathy and indifference to their rights and privileges as Englishmen. They are their birth-right, and we hope they will always be ready to assert and maintain them. All we wish is, that they should, in every question connected with public affairs, act publicly, for no truth can be more clear than that where secrecy begins safety ends. We are persuaded that no circumstance could have occurred of a more tranquillizing nature than the acquittals at York. From this time we hope to date a cordial and friendly disposition between the different classes of society in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield. The people will, there is little doubt, become obedient to the laws, and we hope the Magistrates will meet this disposition by ruling in wisdom and moderation. The local military force can only act under their authority, and we hope they will make it their concern to repress, rather than to encourage, any disposition in the Yeomanry force to consider their countrymen as their foes. Military men ought not to be ardent politicians, it is their duty rather to watch over the peace of society, than to interfere with the political creed of their neighbours.</p>
<p>In the progress of the trials at York, it became clear that violent outrages had been committed, or rather had been meditated, in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th of June; but it was at the same time perfectly manifest, that this local sedition had been greatly exaggerated, and that all the sinister attmempts to give to the riotous proceedings at Folly-Hall Bridge, and the collection of arms in the village of Honley, the character of an insurrection, calculated to endanger the safety of the state, was a gross attempot to practise on the public credulity. The infamous picture of the disturbances drawn by a paper in this place, and copied into the London Treasury Journals, on the eve of the assizes, had, to be sure, the semblance of a likeness, but it was a hideous caricature, and the story about an intended “massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage, to a fearful extent,” proved to be the creature of a distempered imagination, unsupported on the trials by a single tittle of evidence. If the writer of that inflammatory article has not interred all sense of shame in the gulph of his party prejudices, his face must be suffused with blushes, when he compares his paper of the 14th of July, with the report of the trials contained in the same paper of the 28th. Well might Baron Wood, after such a flagrant attempt had been made to mislead the public, caution the jury against suffering their minds to be prejudiced by anything they had heard out of Court. It was agreed on all hands, that the rioters were little more than an unorganized rabble; and it was stated by Mr. Alexander, the person whose horse was shot, that the insurgent army, assembled at Folly Hall Bridge, amounted only to between 60 and 70 men. Mr. Whitehead, the constable, who looked, it should seem, through a glass of <em>multiplying</em> powers, stated the numbers to be upwards of 400.</p>
<p>The Assizes at York will terminate this evening.</p>
<p>We are informed that the Derby calendar contains a great number of criminals, and among them 23 for high treason. The Judge (Mr. J. Holroyd) in his charge to the Grand Jury, commented with great precision and perspicuity upon the Treason Act, 25th of Edward III., the 36th of the King, and the 57th, which made the two former applicable to the Prince Regent. True bills are returned against the other prisoners, of whom six have been convicted. Nothing remarkable has occurred in the case of any of them.</p>

<p><em>This is an abridged form of the article that appeared in the Leeds Mercury - Saturday 02 August 1817.</em></p>
<h3 class="rubric" id="trials-of-the-rioters">TRIALS OF THE RIOTERS.</h3>
<p>In reference to the Trials the Yorkshire Rioters, published in our last paper, the Leeds’ Mercury contains, among other matter, the following remarks:—</p>
<p>“The trials of the State prisoners, as they have been pompously called, closed at York last Saturday; and the four-and-twenty persons against whom the Government solicitor was instructed to institute prosecutions, ten have been pronounced not guilty; against eleven others no bills were found; and one has been liberated on bail; leaving only two in the whole number in Confinement, and those two unfortunate men have been detained, without trial, by a Secretary of State’s warrant, under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Thus ends the Yorkshire plot!</p>
<p>“The failure of these prosecutions has not been owing to any want of zeal, or deficiency of means, on the part of the Government.</p>
<p>“While we speak of the <em>zeal</em> manifested by the persons officially engaged in the trials of the prisoners, we cannot but regret that the Judge should have had occasion complain, in the presence of Mr. Allen and Mr. Haigh, the committing magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the magistrates required, till had made particular inquiry for them. The upright mind of Baron Wood, it was evident, felt wounded by this proceeding, and any thing like reluctance to give to the accused all the advantages any discrepancy between the original examination of a witness and his evidence before the Court, will always be viewed with suspicion by a people jealous of their privileges, and anxious in the highest degree to preserve the stream of public justice free from contamination. The apology made for this suspicious omission by Mr. Le Blanc, the solicitor for the Crown, must be felt by every lover of justice to be extremely unsatisfactory. Some of the examinations, he says, were not taken on oath: but that surely is no reason why the others should be withheld!—and why, we should be glad to know, were examinations involving the liberty and lives of many of our countrymen not taken in the usual and authorised way? Mr. Allison, the clerk to the Huddersfield magistrates, and the professional coadjutor of the Crown solicitor in these prosecutions, might have instructed Mr. Allen’s inexperience. Though his modesty may not allow it, the people of Huddersfield, and the professional gentlemen of the county of York, well know that there are few gentlemen in their profession better acquainted with the duties of a magistrate’s law-clerk, or who has had more experience in criminal matters, than Mr. Allison. If our memory does not fail us, this gentleman acted as law-clerk to Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Radcliffe, during the whole of the disturbances in 1812, when no fewer than 64 persons were committed to York-castle, and when 17 of that number were capitally convicted. Inexperience, therefore, is out of the question; but supposing this to have been the case, the public will naturally inquire, whether Mr. Le Blanc is also inexperienced? and why he who had the chief direction of the prosecution did not order the depositions to be laid before the Judge? These documents were, however tardily, at length produced, and the penetrating eye of Baron Wood soon discovered that Samuel Winpenny had sworn one thing before the magistrates, and another before the Court; and this contradiction on a point of essential importance was very properly deemed by his Lordship fatal to the Witness’s testimony.</p>
<p>“We have been led into these observations by a circumstance of a very extraordinary nature that has come to our knowledge, and which bears a striking affinity the case of McKinle, so recently before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh: but before we proceed to state the facts to which we allude, it may be proper, for the perfect understanding of the subject, to quote the words of Baron Wood, in his charge to the Jury, on the trial of Benjamin Lockwood and others, for maliciously, shooting at Mr. David Alexander, one of the Huddersfield yeomanry cavalry, on the night the 8th of June.  After adverting to the testimony George Armytage, one of the witnesses for the Crown, who had sworn that he and a person of the name of Earnshaw, or Hearnshaw, had been forced to join the rioters at Folly-hall-bridge, his Lordship said—— “There is another circumstance deserving the serious consideration of the jury— the non-production of Hearnshaw as a witness. He has been in the custody of the prosecutors; he is now at York; he was stated by the witness to have been present, and to have seen all the circumstances that Armytage has asserted in evidence; and yet he is not produced! The Jury will draw their own inferences from this strong fact. It was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness.”</p>
<p>“Upon this text of Mr. Baron Wood, the following declaration of Charles Hearnshaw, the witness referred to, furnishes the alarming comment: we publish the document, <em>verbatim</em>, as it has been sent to us, [with the exception of one word used sportively by the Grand Jury], chusing rather to retain even the grammatical inaccuracies, than to make any alterations in the paper itself:—</p>

<p>“<em>To the Editor of the, Leeds Intelligencer.</em></p>
<p>Sir, —From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the <em>Leeds  Mercury</em>, of Saturday, August 2nd, I think myself called upon to DENY, MOST POSITIVELY, that any Conversation passed, in my Presence, of the Nature alluded to in the Declaration signed “CHARLES HEARNSHAW.” Your Insertion of this, in your <em>Intelligencer</em>, will much oblige. Sir, Your obedient Servant, B. HAIGH ALLEN.<br />
“Greenhead, 2nd August, 1817.”</p>
<p>“We were so much occupied with the details of the late important trials of the Huddersfield rioters, that we had not room, in our last, for remarks. They furnish, however, independently of the villainious attempts which have in consequence been made to attach the vilest imputation’s upon the Magistracy and others who were active in bringing the insurgents to trial, abundant matter for serious reflection, and for the exercise of the strictest vigilance, in guarding against the future designs of the disaffected in that and other quarters. What we are about to state is of the deepest importance; and though it is difficult to restrain the boiling indignation occasioned by the ceaseless perversions of an unprincipled and seditious press, we shall endeavour to treat the subject with that temper and moderation which its solemn importance demands. From motives of the purest delicacy, and of respect for the upright and learned Judge who presided at these trials, we intended to have carefully abstained from all notice of fatal misunderstanding, under which he laboured respecting the <em>examinations</em> of some of the witnesses, taken in the earlier stages of the proceedings, by the Committing Magistrates. And the <em>friends</em> of the prisoners, we should have imagined, resting satisfied with the verdict of their acquittal, would have been more anxious to enjoy that <em>triumph</em> in silent satisfaction, than to recur for the insolent purpose of insulting the Magistracy and the Government, to that slippery ground from which the prisoners made, in the words of the Judge, so “<em>narrow an escape</em>” with whole necks. As they have, however, affected, in the midst of their real joy, “regret that the Judge had occasion to complain, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates, that the depositions of the witnesses had not been returned to him, as the duty of the Magistrates required, till he had made particular inquiry for them,”—we feel ourselves bound to complete the history of that unfortunate misunderstanding, <em>part of which</em>, and the most important part, has been <em>wilfully suppressed</em>, by the individuals who have been so imprudent as to bring all before the public. The Judge then, not only <em>complained</em>, in the presence of the Committing Magistrates; he distinctly imputed to them, not only in their own presence, but in that of the Jury, and in open Court, IMPROPER MOTIVES, and an ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE THE JUDGE! We know not what were the feelings of the active and honourable Magistrates at that moment. Those of our Reporter trembled for them, and for the character of the Magisterial jurisprudence of the country. But his fears were instantly dissipated by the open and prompt conduct of the Magistrates. The parties who have brought this circumstance before the public well know (for they were present in Court during the time) that the Committing Magistrates immediately offered to give explanations ON OATH, which would have satisfactorily accounted not only for any apparent irregularity in the production of the examinations, but would have also accounted for the seeming “discrepancy” between the examinations and the evidence. One of the Magistrates Mr. Allen, was actually sworn, and was about to reply to some interrogatories of the Counsel,—when— <em>The Judge PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO HEAR HIM!</em> In laying this important fact before the public we repeat that we have not the intention of imputing the slightest blame to the learned Judge, who, we firmly believe, being under a misunderstanding, did that, and that only, which his conscience, and a high sense of his duty, dictated. Though it is our opinion, therefore, that his refusal to hear the Magistrates had a fatal effect upon the prosecution, we submitted in respectful silence to the verdict, rather than the conscientious conduct of a Judge and Jury should be called in question. With an indecent and imprudent eagerness, however, the occurrence has been dragged, in partial and distorted shape, before the public, by those who ought to been for ever silent on the circumstances of the late trials, from which their friends made so narrow an escape; and we can have no hesitation in saying that <em>their</em> motives, in concealing the fact that the offer of the Magistrates to explain was rejected, are base and designing and wicked, as has been their whole conduct, first in inciting the deluded classes of the people to outrage, and afterwards in labouring incessantly to forward their projects by active assistance; by denying the existence of those projects while denial was possible and by palliating them when they could no longer be concealed.</p>
<p>“Thus far from our own knowledge. We have authority, upon which we can rely, for stating further that the Judge (too late, unfortunately, for public justice) was, after the trial, satisfied that he had been mistaken and SENT AN APOLOGY TO MR. ALLEN, <em>one of the Committing Magistrates</em>, for the expressions he had used. The mistake was perhaps natural, and was at all events on the side of mercy, as was another error into which he fell with respect to the testimony, on a material point, of the witness Winpenny. In spite of the assurances of the Counsel for the prosecution, his Lordship persisted in this mistake, till Mr. Gurney handed him an extract of the evidence, <em>verbatim</em>, from his notes.</p>
<p>“The infamous trumped up paper, published in the last Mercury, and entitled the “<em>Declaration of Charles Hearnshaw</em>” in which Mr. Allen, Mr. Thomas Atkinson, and Mr. Le Blanc, are most foully and libellously charged with having endeavoured to bribe or threaten Hearnshaw to give false evidence, and with having actually falsified his deposition, we pronounce at once to be entirely destitute of truth. So far as Mr. Allen is concerned, we already present the Public (see his letter above) with that Gentleman’s unqualified contradiction. And, if the other parties libelled do not in the mean time determine on vindicating their names in another place, we shall be prepared with the proofs of their honour also in our next. We happened to learn, on the very day of the trial, the real reason that Hearnshaw was not called to give his evidence. It was ascertained that he had been closetted, for a considerable time, with one of the gentlemen employed for the prisoners; and his <em>Declaration</em> proves not only how aptly he had imbibed his lesson, but how accurately the Counsel for the Crown had calculated the effect of the conference, when they declined to place him in the witness box.—This fellow’s Declaration, by-the-bye, except that he <em>now</em> maintains the cavalry fired first, and not the insurgents, goes only to prove the main facts of the outrage, and that he himself was present, thus <em>confirming</em>, the Reader will not fail to observe, <em>the evidence of George Armitage</em>. That the insurgents fired first, is indisputably established, by the unquestionable and positive testimony of Capt. Armytage and Mr. Alexander, as well as by that of Mr. Whitehead the Constable, and of George Armitage. IF the Leeds Mercury, therefore, in his eagerness to fabricate falsehood, and to give currency to every falsehood which is generated in the lowest dregs of his party, had not been blinded to all perception of truth, as well as dead to all sense of shame, he might have discovered, at a glance, before he so grossly committed himself, and so flagrantly abused the liberty of the press, by publishing so atrocious a libel, that Hearnshaw’s story contains internal evidence of utter falsehood,— the principal drift of it being, (next to that of libelling the parties named in it,) to make it appear that the first shot was fired by the <em>cavalry</em>, though the contrary has been irrefrageably established.</p>

<p>The <em>Leeds Intelligencer</em> excerpt was taken from the issue dated <em>Monday 04 August</em>, which then continued in that original publication as follows:</p>

<p>…though the contrary has been irrefrageably established.</p>
<p>But the Mercury is so solemnly absurd, and he so flatly and ludicrously contradicts himself at every turn, and he is so condescendingly gracious to the insurgents, or, as he terms them, “the people”, that we cannot refrain from laying before the Public a few extracts.</p>
<p>Still asserting, though every thing we advanced respecting Huddersfield has been proved in evidence, that we have exaggerated the facts, the Mercury, says, “If the writer of that inflammatory article (see our paper of July 14,) has not interred all sense of shame in the gulph of his party prejudices, his face must be suffused with blushes, when he compares his paper of the 14th of July, with the report of the trials contained in the same paper of the 28th.” Well done! Mr. Mercury! In the first place, this is a tolerably candid submission of the fair, impartial, and faithfil manner, in which our Report of the Trials, was given—a good deal more, as we have shewn above, can be said of the Report, which is given, “with your usual accuracy,” by you.— And, secondly, after having, at your suggestion, taken the trouble to compare <em>all</em> of the statements we have made respecting Huddersfield, with our report of the trials, we find them not only confirmed, but also much more than confirmed by the evidence. This is true, even down to so minute  a circumstance on the mark of the bullet on the deserted house, which the Times[?] endeavoured, at the distance of 200 miles, to ??? by the mere force of his wit, tho’ the ?? of that <em>wit</em>, by the way, has not been a ?? ?? attempted at our expense.</p>
<p>We cannot say, however, that the statement of the Mercury, in ??? is ?? that <em>Taylor</em>, ?? the ?? [of?|at?] the ??, and ?? them, “?time from thenceforth[?] the poor would be rich, and the rich would be poor” was at all alluded to in the evidence. But we do not at all dispute the accuracy of the <em>Mercury</em> in this particular. We have no doubt he had it from the singular <em>authority</em>—perhaps from <em>Taylor himself</em>, or from ?? of his associates as likely to be in communication with the <em>Mercury</em>,—or, for any thing we know to the contrary, some one of the numerous editors of the Mercury may have <em>actually heard it spoken with his own ears!</em> The speech was quoted, as if verbatim; and there is nothing more probable than that the Reporter ?? it down with his “usual accuracy” as the ??! Be this as it may, we are far from calling in question his veracity on a subject on which he is so likely to be <em>well informed!</em>.</p>
<p>But, while he is calling us <em>libre</em>[?],and <em>alarmists</em> and <em>incendiaries</em>, we cannot but feel obliged to him for the ?? (unintentional and blundering as it is) in which he then confirms all we have ever advanced.</p>
<p>In addition to his ?? former admissions, we find in his last pages, for example, many such passages as this:</p>
<p>“We readily admit that the offences clearly proved to have been committed in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, on the night of the 8th of June, called for legal investigation!</p>
<p>Again— “In the progress of the trials at York, it became clear, that violent outrages had been committed, or rather had been meditated, on the night of the 8th of June!”</p>
<p>And again—“The people will, <em>there is little doubt</em>, become obedient to the laws, and we hope the Magistrates will meet this disposition by ruling in wisdom and moderation!”</p>
<p>In ?? breath with these admissions, we are told, “they write from Huddersfield that the <em>reign of terror is at an end</em>, for that the other persons confined either as rioters or as witnesses, at that place, are also liberated.” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[TH:</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">an</span> <span class="pre">exact</span> <span class="pre">quote?]</span></code></p>
<p>Further,— “That there has been <em>very unjustifiable excesses</em> in that neighbourhood, <em>must not be denied</em>, and we hope that the persons engaged in them will, from this moment, discard from their minds any rankling feelings of revenge, or resentment, for the events of past years. If severity produced or aggravated heart-burnings and animosity which every good man must deplore, let clemency extinguish these dispositions, and cast the mantle of oblivion <em>over scenes that ought long since to have been forgotten</em>!”</p>
<p>What a mixture of reluctant acknowledgements, with studied insult to the Magistracy; half-concealed commendation of the rioters, with open censure upon the Government;— the cant of hypocritical moderation, with the most diabolical incentives to fresh atrocities! Is it for the purpose of bringing about <em>“a cordial and friendly disposition between the different classes in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield,”</em> that the disaffected class are told they were treated with severity in the atrocious days of Luddism, and that they are requested (patience, Heaven!) to forgive and forget their <em>oppressions!</em>—and this, too, (that mischief may never be unmingled[?] with absurdity,) because they are told by one and the same person, in one and the same address, that they have been treated with “clemency,” and that they have, <em>at the same time</em>, been subjected to the <em>“reign of terror!”</em></p>
<p>“No, no!— The events and scenes of former years must not be <em>forgotten</em>!— The more intelligint and wealthy classes must never forget the murders, and the destruction of property, perpetrated by a deluded class of men, who had been poisoned by an incediary press!—The deluded class must never forget what was the terrible punishment which fell upon the heads of some of the guilty, after their career of crime had become almost intolerable!—These things must bevr be forgotten, or the unhappy men who paid the forfeit of their lives to the outraged laws of their country, will have been consigned to the grave, for the sake of public tranquillity, IN VAIN.</p>
<p>Is it likely to unite the different classes in bonds of unity, while it is acknowledged there have been <em>“very unjustifiable excesses</em> to tell the persons accused of having perpetrated them , that they have been subjected to the resign of terror, merely becuase they have been subjected, by an upright Magistracy, to the ordinary course of the law  of the land!———</p>
<p>But we confess, we have not patience to dwell upon these features of the inflammatory publication in question. Let us hasten, then, to the conclusion of an article, already, perhaps, (in resuming being self-evident) too much prolonged.</p>
<p>The <em>facts</em> of the disturbances have been completely established, though the Jury did not consider that sufficient legal proofs had been brought against the particular individuals put upon trial for life and death before them. It is established that a still greater number of persons were assembled at the bridge than we ever stated—that more shots were fired that we particularised—and that more persons have absconded. The <em>Times</em>, it is true, and his unworthy coadjutors, have endeavoured, again and again, to make the whole affair assume a trifling and ludicrous aspect, by falsely asserting, in the face of truth, that the insurgents were <em>dispersed</em>, by so small a force as <em>six yeomanry</em>.The yeomanry, on the contrary, were <em>forced to retire before the insurgents</em>, who, in the mean time, very probably decamped, before a greater force was brought against them— a force, which, of course, could have cut double the number of ill-organised ill-armed men to pieces.</p>
<p>But, (and it is with the utmost solemnity we call the Public attention to these concluding observations, and that we pledge ourselves for their truth) the plan and hope of the Insurgents were, to have marched in silence into Huddersfield, after they had been joined by the numerous other parties of rioters, who had not yet come up to the bridge, when the Yeomanry fell in with them; and to have endeavoured to <em>surprise</em> the Military, and the Civil Authorities, in which event they would have been strong enough, before morning, to have kept possession of Huddersfield, for at least some days, and to have commenced their operations of</p>
<p>RAPINE AND MURDER</p>
<p>on an extensive scale.</p>
<p>These, we repeat, are facts. They did not come out on the recent trials, because the prisoners were arraigned only for the burglary at Dyson’s, and for the actual outrage at the bridge; and any circumstances, not directly tending to convict them of these isolated crimes, could not, of course, be brought under the cognizance of the Jury. When the trials of the individuals, charged with High Treason, however, come on, the ultimate object of the Conspirators will be proved. Those circumstances, which we have stated, and many more, of deeper import, will come out in evidence. And, the Public will have it demonstrated to them, that the MASSACRE of individuals as well as the overthrow of property, <em>[see Taylor’s speech in the Mercury]</em> and of the laws, was DETERMINED UPON! We can even mention the names of some of the highly respectable and public-spirited gentlemen, who were to have been amongst the first victims to the revolutionary fury of these <em>patriots</em>—viz. Sir Joseph Radcliffe, Bart.; the Rev. Hammond Roberson, of Healds-Hall; Thomas Atkinson, Esq.; of Colne-Bridge; Mr. Cartwright, the courageous defender of Rawfolds Mill, &amp;c, &amp;c!!—and, they were to have been put to death, in a manner with which we will neither outrage the feelings of our Readers, by a detail, nor disgrace the national character, by recording it.</p>
<p>It is for the prevention, and, thank God, for the hitherto successful prevention, of these horrible atrocities, that Government, and all who advocate the cause of true freedom, sound morality, and the laws, are daily calumniated and reviled, by those who daringly stand opposed to all these, and wish what the preservation of tranquillity is a curse!</p>
<p>We feel obliged for the communication from London, which so satifactorily clears off the calumnies trumped up by the Faction, in consequence of the trial of Andrew Mc’Kinley, in Scotland, for administering unlawlful oaths. It shall appear in our next.</p>
<p>We reserve for our next, also, our closing proofs of the innocence of Oliver; and some remarks on the unhandsome manner, in which Mr. David Alexander (the yeoman whose horse was wounded at Folly-hall-bridge), was treated, in his cross-examination, by the Counsel for the prisoners.</p>

<p>The Monday, August 04, 1817, edition of the Leeds Intelligencer also included a letter from Thomas Atkinson, dated August 2nd, in response to the <em>Leeds Mercury</em>’s publication of Hearnshaw’s letter, to the editor of that publication and to which the <em>Intelligencer</em> was perhaps copied in. This letter was also reprinted from the <em>Intelligencer</em> in the <em>Carlisle Patriot</em> artical of August 09, 1817.</p>

<p>“Just as our Paper was going to Press, we received the following Communication from Mr. Atkinson, of Colne Bridge, addressed</p>
<p>“<em>To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury.</em><br />
Sir—I have seen a  Declaration, in your Paper of this Day, signed “CHARLES HEARNSHAW,” which I should deem unworthy of Notice, but from your insinuation that I had tampered with him.—I feel it a Duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make Oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate; and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least Insinuation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any “Favour” of, or “tampered” with him in any way.I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my Examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry had fired first, and I then observed, that he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he. The paltry circumstance about the <em>Orange Bribe</em> arose from the Complaints of George Armitage and himself being detained long without Dinner, whilst waiting upon the Grand Jury; a Gentleman, hearing them complain, gave them a Biscuit, and I gave them a Shilling for Oranges. These <em>Bribes</em> were given in the most public Manner, as many Persons then present can testify. The Public will judge the Falsehood of Hearnshaw’s Declaration, from his Statement that I said I should contradict him, when it was a well-known Fact that I was Three Miles from the Bridge at the Time of the Firing. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,<br />

<p class="admonition-title">A perversion of truth, August 1817</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000268/18170804/018/0003">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000268/18170804/018/0003</a>
Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 04 August 1817</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer.</p>
<p>MR. PRINTER,—I should be glad through your means to submit to the public the following remarks:</p>
<p>The Editor of the Leeds Mercury perverts the truth.—His mode of perversion appears uniform, and characteristic of those who have been educated and practiced, in a systematic opposition to the administration of the constitution of our country. He perverts words and phrases. He perverts the actions of men in authority. He misleads the minds of the unwary.— He grossly abuses the credulity of the populace. His language and conduct are that of a man who has been hired, countenanced, and supported by persons who love not the glorious constitution of the British Dominions, and who are hostile to the just and legitimate ADMINISTRATION <em>of that Constitution</em>. His employment is to write and publish for a party. It is his business, and he knows how to make it profitable. The views of that party are to bring into disrepute with the body of the inhabitants of these dominions, those persons who administer our country’s laws. For this purpose he is to watch all opportunities, to note all the defects he may be able to discover, to mark all their faults, to record whatever of their proceedings turn out unfavourably, and to bring these things forward to the public view, with the highest possible colouring, and at that moment when they will be likely to produce, in unguarded minds, the greatest dislike to their governors. In this disreputable business he has employed much diligence; he has discovered a dreadful perversion of Truth and Integrity; and an undeviating perseverance in the pursuit of <em>filthy lucre</em>. The grand object evidently is, a material alteration in our Constitution. The present system of our laws <em>(for THAT is our Constitution)</em>—does not suit the party. They want a new constitution:—They want to bring about alterations which shall enable them by degrees to tread down the present rule and authority, that they may rise upon the ruins of those who now defend our rights and our property. The more steady our governors are to the true spirit of our Constitution, the more certain and vigorous will be the opposition of such men. An <em>instance</em> will best explain what is here meant.</p>
<p>The spirit of our laws is not republican. The republicans, therefore, cannot but feel disposed to find fault with our governors, if they be firm to the monarchical part of our constitution. Our system of laws is inseparably connected with a religious establishment. The dissenter cannot but feel himself leaning towards those who find fault with our Governors, when they shew themselves firm to the true interest of our religious establishment. And this bias thus once taken will naturally extend itself, and leads on to a general disike and opposition. Thus the steady endeavour in Government to secure to each man his own person and property, is the very first thing that excites in the republican and the sectariat, a disposition to <em>blame</em> the government. They are not desirous that supremacy should be secured to the King; nor that the rights and possessions of the church should be secured to the priesthood; that respect should be preserved to men in authority; nor rank to those who enjoy it under the King. If therefore we could suppose any set of Ministers under the King of Great Britain to be men of perfect mind, to comprehend fully what, in all cases, suits the constitution of this country; and to be also men of <em>perfect integrity and efficiency</em> to dispense the laws with undeviating exactness, those ministers must, <em>for that very reason,</em> expect the pointed disapprobation of certain classes of men in this country. These men will easily unite with others, in order to carry a point, from whom they greatly differ in some respects. They have done so lately. They eagerly seized the moment of public depression. And by collecting and embodying, into one mass, the <em>vicious</em>, the <em>disappointed</em>, the <em>distressed</em>, and the <em>unguarded</em>, they thought—ignorantly enough—to have gained power so far as to have induced the government to yield something to their influence.</p>
<p>They have met with a disappointment—The mobs they collected understood not the refinement of their leaders. <em>They</em> connected <em>“Ministers”</em> and <em>“Government”</em> under one idea, and impatient of further restraint, began to think of declaring for themselves.— They had been excited by inflammatory paragraphs, by petitions, and by speeches, to a high degree of disaffection—and, impatient of further delay, began to talk freely, and to act upon their new system. Acts of disaffection and rebellion have been committed, and it was of course the imperious duty of the Governors of our country to find out by all proper means, the <em>instigators</em> and <em>promoters</em>, as well as the perpetrators of these acts, that they might be brought to due punishment, or exposed, or restrained, as the cases might require; and that thereby the persons and property of his Majesty’s liege subjects might be protected and secured. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, in this view, is as much a part of the Constitution, tending to the security of person and property, as are those laws which secure to every labouring man the enjoyment of his own wages.—And the Editor of the Leeds Mercury knows that this has been and is the object of Ministers in their late and their present proceedings, and that he <em>perverts the truth</em> when he talks about “Ministers of state being anxious to prove that a large body of the people are discontented.” He next comes forward and talks of the acquittal of the Rioters prosecuted by Government as a <em>“triumph.”</em> He fully allows that “violent outrages had been committed near Huddersfield,” and though he records the declaration of the Judge to the prisoners, “You have now had a very narrow escape,” yet he not only talks of the necessity of considering these men as “<em>innocent</em> of the crimes laid to their charge,” but endeavours to bring all those into contempt, who have been active in endeavouring to bring to <em>“justice”</em> the disturbers of the public peace and safety. It was not to be expected that the <em>activity</em> and <em>manly firmness</em> of* Benjamin Haigh Allen, Esq.* should pass without some imputation. His zeal for <em>justice</em> on the part of the accused, must, <em>naturally</em>, be expected to take in high dudgeon, any zeal for <em>justice on the part of the peaceable inhabitants of Honley and Huddersfield</em>. Nor was it to be expected that this opportunity of “comforting” the disaffected, and of encouraging the active tools of a <em>restless malignant</em> party to perseverance in their object should be let slip, without some word of caution against giving up their object on account of the check they have lately received. Or who, again, could once imagine that this Editor, whose consequence and <em>income</em> are so deeply concerned in the keeping alive an active spirit of disaffection and uneasiness, should shew any “hesitation in making public” the well fabricated “declaration of Charles Hearnshaw,” if that declaration should have the least tendency to cast a slur upon any of those who have been active in securing the public security and peace. This tendency seems to give the “document” <em>authenticity</em> in the mind of this friend of <em>justice</em>, whatever internal marks of imposture or perversion of truth and consistency the instrument may carry upon the face of it:—This tendency in an instrument of this base kind, is yet with this man sufficient ground for a keen attempt to cast an imputation upon the magistrates for committing to prison, men to whom the Judge on the bench, after the jury, from the failure of the evidence to bring the charges home to their legal conviction, had thought it his duty to say—<em>“Prisoners at the bar, Take care of yourselves for the future. You have now had a very narrow escape, and if you persist in such practices as these you may depend upon it you will bring yourselves to an untimely end. Have a care of your future conduct.”</em></p>

<h3 class="rubric" id="the-prosecution-of-the-huddersfield-rioters-and-their-witnesses">THE PROSECUTION OF THE HUDDERSFIELD RIOTERS AND THEIR WITNESSES</h3>
<p>IN another part of our publication of this day, will be found a letter from MR. R. HAIGH ALLEN, Esq. one of the Huddersfield Magistrates, denying, in positive terms, that any conversation of the nature referred to in CHARLES HEARNSHAW’s Declaration, inserted in our last week’s paper, took place in his presence. This disclaimer of  Mr. ALLEN is followed by a letter from Mr. THOMAS ATKINSON, in which he asserts that he asked no <em>favour</em> of CHARLES HEARNSHAW as stated in his Declaration, but admits that he had a conversation with him in the anti-room, previous to the examination of Hearnshaw before the Grand Jury, and that he combated the evidence which Hearnshaw stated that it was his intention to give, respecting the first fire at Folly-hall- Bridge, on the night of the 8th of June, and endeavoured to influence his mind contrary to the witness’s avowed impressions of the facts to which he was about to swear. Mr. Atkinson adds, that he did indeed give Armitage and Hearnshaw a shilling’s worth of oranges, because they had been so long detained from their dinner,—but that this “bribe,” as Mr. Atkinson calls it, was given in the most public manner.</p>
<p>Upon the appearance of these counter-statements, we felt it to be our duty to write to a tradesman in Huddersfield, requesting that he would see Hearnshaw, the declarant, and inquire into the truth of his Declaration; adding, that if he had, either from design or inadvertency, stated any thing that was false, to the disadvantage of Mr. Allen or Mr. Atkinson, or any of the other persons mentioned in his publication, it was as much his duty to make a public retraction of those statements, (if erroneous) as it was to persist in them if true. In reply to this letter, Hearnshaw himself came over to Leeds, and waited upon the Printer of this Paper, when he re-asserted, in the presence of a gentleman of the town, all the facts he had stated in his Declaration, and added, that he was ready to verify them, upon oath, before any Magistrate in the kingdom.</p>
<p>It is no part of our duty to reconcile the conflicting testimony of Mr. Allen and Mr. Thomas Atkinson with that of Charles Hearnshaw. They are, indeed, irreconcileable. It is assertion against assertion. We have merely inserted the papers as they have reached us, without feeling either responsibility or anxiety about the truth of any of them. The conflict, it will be observed, is between the parties in the prosecution and one of their principal witnesses, and it is impossible to imagine any thing that could be more gratifying to the feelings of the State prisoners, so lately acquitted or discharged, for want of evidence to put them upon their trial, than to find the committing Magistrate and one of the witnesses, on whose testimony they were committed to York Castle, impeaching each other’s veracity. The prosecutors, in these State trials, are, to be sure, placed in a most curious predicament, with respect to their witnesses —those they did produce the Court would not believe, and those they did not produce they will not believe themselves!</p>
<p>There is, however, one part of Hearnshaw’s evidence, and that the most material part of it, which stands uncontradicted, and which, we understand, is unquestionable, namely, that he was examined before the Grand Jury, and that, because his testimony did not square with the wishes of the prosecutors for conviction, he was not produced on the trial, though as the learned Judge observed, “it was the duty of the prosecutors, and due to the justice of the case, to have brought forward this witness.” BARON WOOD added, that the Jury would draw their own inferences from this strong fact.</p>
<p>The characteristic feature of these prosecutions was <em>suppression</em>. In the first place, the depositions of the witnesses, taken by the committing magistrates, were withheld, contrary to the usual practice, till the Judge made particular inquiries for them:— in the second, the evidence of a principal witness was suppressed, though he had been kept a month in confinement in order to be prepared to give that evidence:— and, in the third and last place, if we are rightly informed. the depositions taken before the Magistrates at Wakefield, during their inquiry into this business, on the 9th of June, though containing, we have reason to believe, important matter to the prisoners, was also suppressed. In the emphatic words of BARON WOOD, the public “will draw their own inferences” from these “strong facts.”</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is a fact deserving of observation, that in both the reports of the trial of the persons charged with stealing arms and with tumultuous proceedings in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield, inserted in the Intelligencer, the editor of that paper <em>suppressed</em> the Judge’s charges <em>in toto</em>. But in order to compensate his readers for the omission, he has presented them this week with a <em>proscription</em> list, and has actually had the extreme folly to hold up certain Gentlemen by name as the intended objects of assassination. For ourselves we believe this list to be the fabrication of some Government informer, with whom probably this Government scribe is in communication. As nothing came out upon the trial respecting the announced “massacre, plunder, fire, and carnage to fearful extent,” we are told that this exposure is reserved till a future period, and that <em>when</em> the trials of the persons sent to York Castle and detained on a charge of high treason come on, <em>then</em> the whole of these horrors will appear. This is probably true; <em>when</em> those trials do come on, strange sights will be seen. If we recollect right, the public were assured, on precisely the same authority as that on which the proscription list rests, that at the assizes which have just passed, a number of the prisoners were to be tried for <em>high treason</em>, but this proved to be “an unaccountable mistake!” This renowned proscription will, we have no doubt, prove to be “an unaccountable mistake” also, and we hope the proscribed and her families will have too much good sense to make themselves uneasy about the danger of the assassin, which we believe, like Macbeth’s dagger, is purely <em>aerial</em>— “a dagger of the mind.”</p>
<p>In reading the <em>Intelligencer</em> of the present week, one is puzzled to discover whether Baron Wood or the Printer of the Leeds Mercury is most to <em>blame</em> for the acquittal of the State prisoners at York, and for the <em>fatal</em> consequences of that acquittal, though we think, on the whole, the Judge has it. If, however, the very <em>impartial</em> Editor has been a little too severe upon the judge and upon the Printer, he has been sufficiently indulgent towards the prosecutors, for he has very obligingly forborne from saying a single word in condemnation of those omissions and commissions at which the humane feelings of the whole Court were revolted. Upon the prisoners he bears unmercifully, directing his condemnation indiscriminately against those who were acquitted, and those who, after having been immured in prison for several weeks, were sent home, because there was not sufficient evidence even to put them upon their trials. They, poor souls, have nothing to give, but the Magistrates and the yeomanry, who have favours to bestow, he lauds to the skies. The maxim of this <em>Sir Pertimax Mac Sycophant</em> is to bless every man possess’d of aught to give.</p>

<p>To the Editor of the Leeds Mercury</p>
<p>Sir,— From the manner in which my Name has been brought forwards in the <em>Leeds Mercury</em>, of Saturday, August 2d, I think myself called upon, <em>to deny, most positively</em>, that any conversation passed, in my presence, of the nature alluded to in the declaration signed “CHARLES HEARNSHAW”.

I feel it is a duty I owe to myself to say, and am ready to make oath, that I was present at his Examination before Mr. Allen, the Magistrate;  and am quite certain Hearnshaw never mentioned the Cavalry having fired first upon the Mob, nor gave the least intimation of such a thing to Mr. Allen; and I positively deny that I asked any “favour” of or “tampered” with him in any way. I recollect, however, that whilst I was in the Waiting-Room of the Grand Jury, previous to my examination before them, I was informed that Hearnshaw had been saying that the Cavalry fired first, and I then observed he must be mistaken as to that, because Captain Armytage, Mr. David Alexander, and George Whitehead, would all prove the Mob fired first, as they were all near the Bridge as well as he.</p>
<p>The paltry circumstance about the <em>Orange-Bribe</em>, arose from the complaints of George Armitage and himself being detained so long without dinner, whilst waiting upon the Grand Jury; a gentleman, on hearing them complain, gave them a biscuit, and I gave them a shilling for oranges. These <em>Bribes</em> were given in the most public manner, as many persons then present can testify.</p>
<p>THe Public will judge of the falsehood of Hearnshaw’s Declaration, from his statement that I said, I should contradict him. when it was a well known fact that I was three miles from the Bridge at the time of the firing.</p>

<p>We had intended, by a future examination of the falsehoods respecting Oliver, to have shewn still more clearly the abominable and fraudulent artifices resorted to, in order to impose on the public, respecting the proceedings of that individual; but, on more mature consideration, we think his innocence has already been so irrefutably established, that all further discussion on the subject can only serve to give importance to the often-told tales of his enemies.—We shall only, therefore, give a word or two of advice to his accusers, which will put their sincerity to the test, and even this, after all that has passed, would be unnecessary, were it not that there are so many persons who are determined to adhere to falsehood in the face of conviction,</p>
<p>If they are so satisfied, as they pretend to be, of Oliver’s guilt, why do they not have him apprehended? The man, we believe, is in London; and, no doubt, if a moderate reward be offered for taking him, they may have him lodged in safe custody within a few days after they shall have taken the proper steps for laying hold of him. Surely the Faction are not reduced so wretchedly low, that they cannot raise a sufficient sum, by subscription, to carry on a prosecution against a single individual, whom they can clearly convict, they say, of the most enormous guilt— of having laboured , as much as he could, to overthrow the security and happiness of the country, and the safety of individuals.</p>
<p><em>Is their patriotism come to this?</em> They talk loudly of the sacrifices they would make for Country (though, by the way, it has so happened that they have never yet discerned a single opportunity for making any sacrifice); and yet, if we believe their own assertions, the liberty, security, and peace, of the country, are to be overthrown with impunity by Mr. Oliver, rather than a few of them will subscribe a guinea a piece to bring him to punishment! They clamour, it is true, for Government to institute proceedings against him; but, the cunning rogues know that Government are satisfied of his innocence; and that, with all their condescension, that are not quite so complaisant as to subject an innocent man to the trouble, anxiety, and inconvenience of a trial, merely for the purpose of <em>pleasing them!</em> Let them either, therefore, drop the name of Oliver for ever, or let them subject him at once, and in a manly manner, to the operation of the law.—Let them lay information against him on oath—find persons to prosecute—and the necessary funds for carrying the prosecution on; and let them offer so small a reward its TEN GUINEAS for his apprehension; and we will stake our character for foresight on the issue, if Mr. Oliver is not taken by the neck within ten days after the reward is publicly advertised. We offer them the use of the Intelligencer for the Advertisement, if they think proper to adopt the plan recommended.</p>
<p>By the way, we can state, from authority, that the two Magistrates who once doubted Oliver’s innocence, and who examined him, in consequence, at the Secretary of State’s Office, investigated the charges against him, with the most scrupulous care, not less than two hours, before they declared themselves completely satisfied of the utter falsehood of all the fabrications against him. As the name of one of these Magistrates (perhaps without his concurrence) was employed to give some colour to the falsehoods, we have rather anxiously indulged a hope that he would come forward, and officially acknowledge he had been satisfied of Oliver’s innocence. We think this is an act of Justice (though we presume not to assert it is imperative on the party in question) due to Mr. Oliver, and not only to him, but to the public at large. There is one falsehood connected with the use made of this Magistrate’s name, which we ourselves are enabled to contradict. The party by whom the whole tale was tromped up, had the temerity not merely to insinuate, but directly to assert, that the Magistrate in question, at the first impulse of disgust, had some intention of throwing up his commission.— Though the “Getter-up-of-the-Plot,” however, had so far imposed upon him as to succeed in making him doubt the innocence of Oliver, the idea of throwing up his commission never entered his mind, and is altogether the creation of those who fabricated so many other little circumstances, for the purpose of exciting a <em>great sensation</em> in Parliament and in the country.</p>
<p>But, if there are reasons sufficiently strong to induce to waive further discussion respecting Oliver, after the Public have been satisfied of his innocence, there are more weighty and powerful reasons against prolonging a controversy which involves, in some degree, the almost sacred character of a British Judge, and the purity and honour of a British Magistrate. he Magistrate has already unequivocally refuted the abominable calumny directed against him by the villainous master and tool of the vilest dregs of disaffection is this district; and, for a moment to balance “his assertion” against the “assertion of Charles Hearnshaw,” and of Edward Baines, even though there were not so many other conclusive proofs that the charge was utterly false, would be offering as insult to the public sense and to public decency, and a greater outrage on the honour and feeling of Mr. Allen, as a man, a magistrate, and a gentleman, than any to which the upright discharge of his public duties has yet subjected him. The futile attempt to fix a stigma upon his name, by those whose avocation is to traduce everything truly good, and great, and virtuous, is a proof of the meritorious zeal with which he has exerted himself in the public service, and can only serve to place those exertions in the most conspicuous light; while the abhorrent indignation of every good man is directed against his traducers.</p>
<p>Another of the gentlemen libelled, Mr. Thomas Atkinson, also vindicated his name, in our last, from the foul aspersion cast upon it; though his letter was received so late, thee we could not allude to it at the same time with Mr. Allen’s; and it may therefore have escaped the notice of some of our Readers. The third party libelled, Mr. Le Blanc, we find had left Yorkshire before the slander was published; and has either not yet had time to repel it, or (though the Libeller, struck with terror at the -probable consequences of his temerity, now affects to say he published the calumny, “without feeling either anxiety or responsibility about its truth,”) Mr. Le Blanc may very properly have determined on calling the aggressor to account before a more solemn tribunal than that which he is afforded by the column of a newspaper.</p>
<p>As for the conduct of the Judge, and the history of the examination, we do most solemnly assure the Public, that what we stated in our last (to which we beg leave to refer) was the truth, and nothing but the truth. As that statement, also contained the WHOLE TRUTH, we have no new facts to communicate on the subject; and, though it would be an easy matter to dissipate the sophistry, and to clear up the misstatements, of those who have had the audacity to pervert the facts for the vilest purposes, we entered, last week, with too much reluctance and caution upon so delicate a discussion, not to feel inclined to abstain from all unnecessary prolongation of it. It is not so with the factious agitators of this unpleasant affair. It is their object and business, to lessen, by all possible means, whether fair or foul, that just respect which is due to persons in authority. Whether they succeed or fail, therefore, in establishing a calumny, their end is partly accomplished, if they can only manage to keep the imputation for any of length of time before the public, and familiarise the minds of the lowest of the people to imputations that make them think and speak of their superiors with suspicion and disrespect. In the present instances, it would be all one to them whether the? character of the Judge, or of the Magistrate, or of both, suffered by the controversy, so as <em>mischief</em> is any how produced. They perceive we are aware of their system; and that we are not, of course, to be betrayed by the warmth of our feelings (indignant as they are) into the furtherance of their insidious designs.</p>
<p>We are not amongst those who are inclined to attach unworthy motives to any man in the discharge of his duties; but there is a circumstance connected with this affair which is rather curious, and which clearly proves that all the perverse statements of the incendiary demagogues who labour incessantly to agitate the public mind, ought to he viewed with the greatest distrust.</p>
<p>The Mercury states, that “Mr. Allison, solicitor, of Huddersfield, (who acted as Clerk to the Magistrates  when the prisoners were committed,) said to the Judge” on the day after the misunderstanding, “My Lord, no fault whatever is imputable to Mr. Allen on account of the depositions not having been regularly laid before your Lordship; if there be any fault, it is solely attributable to myself; and my Lord, as I have not been in the habit of acting as a Magistrates’ Clerk, I trust your Lordship will impute any irregularity that may have occurred, to my ignorance of what ought to have been done in this respect.”</p>
<p>In this report of what was said by Mr. Allison, there is, as usual, a mixture of truth and falsehood. That gentleman did not admit that the depositions had not been laid regularly before the Judge.— He merely said, that <em>if</em> any thing was wrong, or <em>if</em> there had been any mistake, he alone, on account of his inexperience, had been to blame; and he concluded with a just tribute of respect to Mr. Allen, than whom, he said, there was not a more active or upright Magistrate in the county.</p>
<p>But, this perversion is, comparatively, of little moment. On the Mercury’s own showing, Mr. Allison admitted himself to be <em>wholely and solely blameable for any irregularity which might have occurred</em>.</p>
<p>Yet, (and let the Reader mark this carefully) the Mercury <em>wholly and solely</em> attributes the blame, coupled with an imputation of the <em>vilest intentions</em>, not to Mr. Allison, but, <em>to the Magistrates!</em>—and, being secretly grateful to Mr. Allison, for any (supposed) mistake, which tended materially to defeat the ends of public justice, the Mercury, instead of <em>blaming</em> him, to whom alone, if there was any blame at all, that blame is due, warmly eulogises Mr. Allison for his professional abilities, compliments him on his modesty, and particularly praises him for his skill and experience as a Magistrate’s Clerk!!!</p>
<p>Not one word more, we are satisfied, is necessary to make the blood of every honest man boil with indignation at the systematic and villainous attempts which are made to excite hatred of the Magistracy and of the laws, amongst the people.</p>
<p>Further, however, it is well known that Mr. Allison is of <em>Whig principles!</em> The Committing Magistrates, happily, are not of his party! The foul mind of the Mercury, if a similar event had occurred Under other circumstances—if a <em>Tory</em> Magistrates’ Clerk had committed a mistake as favourable to <em>Tory</em> prisoners before a <em>Whig</em> tribunal—in such a case, we say, the Mercury would not have hesitated to assert, or at least to insinuate, that the mistake had been purposely <em>committed, in order prejudice the Judge and Jury against the prosecution, and against the conduct and motives of the Prosecutors!</em></p>
<p>Though this certainly was <em>the fatal effect of the misunderstanding in question</em>, we would spurn, with as much indignation as Mr. Allison himself, at so base and unworthy a suspicion. He discharged his duty, <em>we are not the slightest doubt</em>, to the best of his ability, and with perfect integrity;—and we have put the preceding case, merely for the purpose of exposing to him, and <em>to all other respectable men of his party</em>, the extreme danger of giving credit to, or at all countenancing, the slanderous imputations of any low, despicable, and seditious demagogue, conscientiously discharging public official duties.— Let them not be flattered into becoming the instruments of such men,— lest they be <em>judged by their own judgement</em>.</p>

<p>And also as promised, on the treatment of David Alexander during the Folly-hall trial:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Sarcastic Attacks on Mr. David Alexander, August 1817</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000268/18170811/023/0003">https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000268/18170811/023/0003</a></p>
<p>Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 11 August 1817</p>
<p>In reading of the Trials at the late Assizes in various parts of the kingdom, we have been very much disgusted to observe the flippancy which several of the Gentlemen of the Bar appear to have conducted themselves.—“There be of them that will themselves launch, to set on some quantity of barren? spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the <em>suit</em> be then to be considered; that’s villainous; and shows a most pitiful ambition in him who uses it.” It is a practice that ought to be generally discountenanced; for can any thing be more intolerable than that when the character and property of any man, however humble, are at stake in a Court of Justice, his counsel, instead of evincing the anxiety which would become him on such an occasion, is to be occupied in racking his memory for a stale joke, or availing himself of any passing occurrence to vent some miserable pun;  in order, as he perhaps conceives, to show his country auditor what a smart man a London barrister is. This is one of those offences against good sense and decency, which we think it behoves every public writer to visit with marked reprobation; and in saying his we are sure that credit will be given to us for entertaining towards the legal profession all the respect to which it is justly entitled when the duties of that profession are discharged,—as, happily, in most instances, the are discharged,—with fidelity and dignity.—<em>Courier</em></p>
<p>The preceding judicious observations of the <em>Courier</em>, apply so well to the treatment of Mr. David Alexander, that we adopt them at once in alluding to the very unhandsome manner in which one of the Counsel for the prisoners attempted to show off his wit, at Mr. A.’s expense, during the trial of Lockwood, Woffendan, &amp;c. at our late assizes.</p>
<p>Besides resorting to every artifice of the law, in favour of their clients (with which we do not mean to find any fault), and exerting themselves in every possible manner to prejudice the minds of the Jury against the prosecution, and in favour of the prisoners, one of the Counsel thought fit to single out Mr. Alexander as a mark for his wit, levelling at him the coarsest and most indecorous sarcasms, while he was giving his evidence, though he had the mortification of failing to excite a single risible expression on the countenances of the persons present.</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander had been, on two occasions, in the discharge of his duty, not as an ordinary soldier, but as an armed citizen, exposing himself for the protection of his neighbours, and the preservation of the public peace, <em>fired at in one night</em>. Some cowardly ruffian shot at him, under cover of the night, while he was on foot, going for his horse; and he was afterwards exposed, in front, to the fire of the insurgents at Folly-hall-bridge, where his horse was severely wounded under him. He had displayed a spirit and intrepidity which entitle him to respect, and which must receive the approbation and thanks of every man who is disposed to appreciate those qualities when exhibited in a good cause; and, the only return which was made him for having twice exposed his life to imminent hazard, for the protection of those who were quietly and comfortably asleep in their beds, was to be held up as an object of ridicule to the Court of Justice in which he was called upon to perform another service to the public, by giving his evidence on a case of flagrant public outrage;— to be jeered at about the “sanguinary battle of Folly-hall-bridge in which he had been <em>engaged</em>”— <em>rigged</em> as the term is, about his “military tactics”—and ironically asked if he had obtained his martial skill and courage at <em>Waterloo!</em></p>
