# A Slight Aside — The Remand of Riley and Lee

In report of the trials surrounding the Folly Hall Affair, two names crop up of men who were remanded back to prison apparently by order of Lord Sidmouth: Thomas Riley and Richard Lee, perhaps the same Richard Lee who had appeared as a witness for the defence in the state trial at York in January, 1813.

Morning Herald (London) - Monday 13 October 1817

On Tuesday last, an inquisition was taken by Mr. T. Shepley, of Selby, one of the Coroners for this county, before a respectable Jury of freeholders, over the body of Thomas Riley, a prisoner in the Castle of York, charged with high treason, who destroyed himself about four o'clock in the morning of the same day (when in bed along with another prisoner, and in company with three persons), by cutting his throat with an old razor, which he had unfortunately purloined from a fellow prisoner. Upon a full and minute investigation, it was proved to the said Coroner and Jury, that at the time of his having committed the fatal deed, he was not of sound mind and understanding, but lunatic and distracted; for it appeared; that previous to his being committed to the Castle, the 4th of July last, he attempted, whilst under confinement at Huddersfield, to hang himself; and that about two months ago, he made a second attempt to do the same in the Castle, when in bed with another prisoner, but was prevented.

Lee, it seems, continued to remain imprisoned, until he was released by order of Lord Sidmouth in December, 1817.

Globe - Wednesday 25 February 1818

Mr. BENNETT presented Petitions from Benjamin Whiteley, of Horbury, in Yorkshire, and Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, in the same county, who had been both confined on suspicion of high treason, in pursuance of the power granted to Ministers by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. That of the latter stated a case of unprecedented hardship, the Petitioner having been confined in heavy irons, for twenty weeks, in York Castle, and compelled to sleep in the same bed for several nights with a person charged with murder, for which he was afterwards executed. He was subsequently confined in a similarly close way with a prisoner, whose consciousness of his atrocious crimes induced him to cut his own throat, whilst in confinement in the same cell together.

MEETING OF THE LIVERY, TO PETITION THE PARLIAMENT AGAINST PASSING BILLS OF INDEMNITY.

On Tuesday a meeting of the livery was held in Guildhall, for petitioning parliament against any bill of indemnity to ministers, and praying that a rigid inquiry might be made into their conduct. The lord mayor came on the hustings at one o'clock, attended by Alderman Curtis, Shaw, Wood, Atkins, Goodbehere, Thorp, the sheriffs, &c.

The requisition having been read,

*Mr. Favell* rose to propose a series of resolutions for the consideration of the meeting. The occasion on which they were assembled was one of a most important nature. Were such suspension acts constantly to occur as this country had painfully seen of late, we might indeed bombard the Algerines, but we could see their spirit actuating our government. He had read the several petitions as presented to parliament by the sufferers under the act, but he now had one in his hands which contained an account of the greatest inhumanity and cruelty ever read of. Mr. Favel then read a statement of the case of Thomas Riley, who was committed to York Castle in July last, by order of Lord Sidmouth, and at the following assizes his solicitor had prepared his defence, but he was refused a trial, for reasons well known, the palladium of British liberty being at that time and still continuing suspended. He remained in prison until the 7th of October, when he put a period to his existence by cutting his throat, occasioned by a depression of spirits brought on by confinement. Although a petition, numerously and respectably signed by his friends at Huddersfield, and a certificate from his medical attendant accompanying such petition, had been laid before Lord Sidmouth, of the danger of his further confinement, and of his acknowledged industry, and respectability of character and loyalty in his own neighbourhood, and although Mr. Barclay pressed the necessity of his liberation upon the noble secretary, yet his case was neglected, and he could not bear so ignominious an incarceration without being allowed an opportunity of exculpating himself from charges yet unknown, and believed never to have existed. Mr. Favel concluded by moving a series of resolutions, expressive of the object of the meeting, upon which the petitions were founded. (A copy of these resolutions next week.)

*Mr. Waithman* seconded the resolutions. It was obvious to the weakest capacity that on no account ought such unconstitutional powers to be granted to administration, unless in cases of actual rebellion, or threatened invasion. No such case had latterly existed, and certainly it was the bounden duty of ministers not to shrink from enquiry, but boldly to come forward and submit their conduct to investigation before a candid and impartial tribunal, and not leave it to be judged of by a committee composed of their own creatures and pensioners. He had that morning read the report of the lords' committee on this new edition of the green bag, but as he had all along expected, it contained nothing new, but was composed of allegations already well known to the public. The only reason given for not bringing the unhappy sufferers to trial was, that "it was intended to have brought them to trial, but circumstances occurred to prevent it." What were these circumstances? Though ministers had declined announcing them to the public, could the public be at a loss to guess what they were? The agents hired and paid by government had outdone their work, and being thereby exposed, ministers durst not call the sufferers before a British jury. They were afraid to face the country, and they had, therefore, appointed a committee (justly called a *humbug* committee) to examine their acts, and to justify the manner in which their powers had been exercised. He called on the city representatives to come forward, and declare what line of conduct they meant to pursue on this occasion, and whether the petition would meet their support in the house? He particularly hoped that the honourable baronet (Curtis) would not insult the livery by any of his coarse jokes; and he trusted the livery would shew that they would no longer be trifled with in that measure.

*Mr. Williams* came forward amidst general disapprobation. He began to defend the conduct of ministers, alleging, that from their respectable characters as individuals, he could not conceive the charge of their employing spies at all credible.

*Mr. Wooler* rose to move an amendment, not because he differed from the spirit of the resolutions, but because he thought the language by no means strong enough. The suspension act had passed in a time of profound peace, and had been attended with circumstances of a serious nature. What, he would ask, was the cause of its at all taking place? Was it owing to any real disaffection in the country? There certainly was no such thing; and the sole cause was, that ministers, seeing the nation dissatisfied with their administration of public affairs, became terrified for their places and emoluments, and on that account assumed this most arbitrary authority. With respect to Riley's case, he would state from personal information, that two men were put into the cell where that unfortunate man terminated his existence, and *while that cell was clotted with blood*. Such cruelties as they had heard were inflicted, deserved the severest censure, and on that account he moved his resolutions as an amendment.

*Mr. Hunt* seconded the amendment. He stated his having been at Derby during the state trials, and he firmly believed, that had the unhappy sufferers there been tried before a London jury, they would have been acquitted. There was evidence sufficient, no doubt, to have convicted these men of burglary, of robbery, and one of them of murder; but this was not the kind of conviction desired by ministers, nothing less than a conviction for high treason being necessary for them, that they might have a case to justify the Habeas Corpus being suspended.

After a few words from Mr. Favell, in reply, the amendment was put and negatived by a very great majority, only a few hands being held up for it. The original resolutions were then agreed to.

*Sir W. Curtis*, on the resolution for the city members being instructed to support the petition, being read, came forward and expressed his decided conviction of the propriety of the measures taken by ministers for the protection of the country. He could not agree with the petition.

*Sir J. Shaw* said the meeting were well acquainted with the motives from which he had acted last year, and he conceived it was but just that he should hear what ministers had to say in their defence, before he decided.

*Mr. Alderman Atkins* was glad the amendment had been negatived, and he was astonished that the livery could patiently submit to hear such individuals, especially one at whose door lay the blood of an unfortunate individual.— *(Hisses, and cries of name, name.)*—He had no hesitation in saying, that the blood of John Cashman was justly chargeable on him who had that day presided at Spa-fields, and drawn a crowd of the lower orders together, for the purpose of grossly deluding them. *(Much confusion.)* After some observations respecting the manner in which he should do his duty, the alderman retired amidst the loud hootings of the meeting.

*Mr. Hunt* explained. He entered into a long detail of the proceedings at Spa-fields, and on the trial of Cashman; and observed, that that individual had been driven to the act for which he died by actual starvation, in consequence of his just claims to £200. prize-money being refused, and he had committed the crime in the presence of a mob who had left the field two hours before he (Mr. H.) came to it. Did the alderman remember the case of the boy whom he had flogged? Was there no blood there to be accounted for? With the knowledge of that fact, his mouth should have been shut, and the livery had this day shewn their contempt of him, by the very proper marks of disapprobation so unequivocally bestowed on him. *(Applauses.)*

*Mr. Alderman Wood* returned thanks to the livery for appointing him to carry their petition to the house.

After thanks to Messrs. Favell, Waithman, and the lord mayor, the hall was adjourned.

COMMUNITY HALL

On Tuesday, a Commons Hall of the liverymen of London assembled pursuant to a requisition, to petition both Houses of Parliament against any indemnity bill, and against the conduct of administration during the suspension of thy Habeus Corpus Act.

Mr. FAVELL said there had been many dreadful instances of abuse in the conduct of administration; some, indeed, so dreadful that one could scarcely think of them without shuddering. He was always unwilling to take up the time of the Hall, but there was something that had come to him that day of the most extraordinary and important nature. He alluded to two letters that had been put into hands, the subject of which, he had been told, was to be agitated in Parliament by the noble lard, the member for Yorkshire. [The worthy gentleman then read the following documents:—]

"Catherine -house, Jan. 26, 1818.

"My Lord,— I beg leave to lay before your lordship a most distressing case of the widow and family of ten children of the late Thomas Riley, who was, in my opinion, unjustly committed to York Castle in July last, by order of Lord Sidmouth, as stated by B. H. Allen, Esq. but contradicted by my Lord Sidmouth, when questioned afterwards by Mr. Barclay, M.P.; who said he knew nothing against him, although the before—mentioned magistrate had stated to a respectable merchant of Huddersfield, that they had no charge against him there, but that he was ordered to be detained by the Secretary of State tor the Home Department, and committed to prison. At the following assizes his solicitor had prepared his defence, but he was refused a trial, for reasons well known to your lordship, the palladium of British liberty being at that time, and still continuing, suspended. He remained in prison until the seventh of October, when he put a period to his existence by cutting his throat, occasioned by depression of spirits brought on by confinement. Although a petition, numerously and respectably signed by his friends at Huddersfield, and a certificate from his medical attendants accompanying such petition, had been laid before Lord Sidmouth, of the danger of his further confinement, and of his acknowledged industry, and respectability of character and loyalty in his own neighbourhood; and although Mr. Barclay pressed necessity of his liberation upon the noble Secretary, yet his case was neglected, and he could not bear so ignominious incarceration without being allowed an opportunity of exculpating himself from charges yet unknown, and believed never to have existed. Under these circumstances, can I prevail upon your lordship to lay this case before the executive Government of the country, and intercede for some annual assistance, as either the Huddersfield magistrates or the Secretary of State must have been the cause of robbing this family of their present as well of all future prospect of support and protection from their natural parent and guardian. Begging your pardon for this intrusion, I remain, "Your lordship's most obedient humble servant,  
"M.S.  
"Right Hon. Lord Milton, M. P., &c."

Such was the substance of the letter which the brother of this unfortunate man had addressed to the member for Yorkshire. The other documents stated, that—

"On Tuesday the 17th of last June, George Whitehead, constable of Huddersfield, went to my brother's house, and told him he was his prisoner, and expressed that he was much pleased he had at length got hold of him; he never showed any authority for taking him, and it is generally believed he had no warrant for that purpose. On hearing that he was apprehended, I went over to Huddersfield, but was denied admittance to him, nor could I learn any charge they had against him; but learned that bail to any amount had been offered, but was declined on the part of B. H. Allen, magistrate of Huddersfield, intimating at the same that he had not acted on the same information, but from higher authority. On learning this I wrote to you, informing you that, as far as I could hear, the information or charge was laid in London, at the Secretary of State's office. On the receipt of my letter you applied through the medium of Mr. Barclay, M. P., to Mr. Addington, Under-Secretary of State; this was on Wednesday, 2d July: on the very same day a respectable gentleman at Huddersfield was deputed to wait on Mr. Benjamin H. Allen, who asked him if bail would be taken for my brother; Mr. Allen said he could not be liberated upon bail. The gentleman then took the liberty of asking Mr. Allen what where the charges against Thomas Riley? He immediately replied, they had no charges against him; but that an order had come down from London for his apprehension, and until he received further information from the Secretary of State he could do nothing, the charges being laid there. I have already stated this was on Wednesday the 2d July; now, on Friday the 4th of July, through the medium of Mr. Barclay, M.P., you received Mr. Addington's answer, stating there was no charge against Thomas Riley, and that he was not detained by order of the Secretary of State, and that if he was detained it was by the local magistrates of the place where he was apprehended. As with abhorrence I view those vexatious and contradictory statements, now on this same day, Friday, the 4th of July, Mr. B. H. Allen committed my brother to York Castle, and on the following day he was sent to the County Gaol, under a strong escort of yeomanry cavalry, after being kept at Huddersfield near three weeks, during all which time his distressed wife and numerous family were denied all access to or correspondence with him. On the 11th July, he was furnished with a copy of the charges which were stated would be preferred against him at the ensuing assizes; but, in the interim, a detainer was obtained from the Secretary of State, they being well aware that they could not criminate before a jury of his country."

When application was made to know why that man had been imprisoned, the magistrates had said it was by order of Lord Sidmouth. It was said that orders had come from London for his apprehension, and till further orders, no alteration could be made in his confinement. When application was made on the subject in London, however, it was said that there was no charge against him there, and he was certainly confined by the local magistrates. It could be proved upon oath, that the head and front of that man's offending was neither more or less, than that Oliver had known a man of the name of Dawson, to whom he communicated that there was to be a great rising, and that Dawson, telling this to Riley, he had told it to some other person, Riley was as innocent as any man. He (Mr. Favell) was convinced that he himself deserved confinement ten thousand times more than that innocent man, for he had attended many meetings in that hall, and elsewhere. He could not forbear telling them that it was from the very boards on which he stood, that a brave man, for daring to ask the Lord Mayor to petition for a new parliament, had been taken up and thrown into prison. Indeed, if ever the Corporation should vote another statue, it should be for that man, and then he and Beckford would see one another.—*Applause.*—He did not mean to say any thing against a Scarlet gown, but that man had only a plain blue one; though he would say that had he lived at the present day, only a linen-draper and shopkeeper as he was, he should have thought it right to send him to parliament.—*Applause.*—They would soon come to something like a day of reckoning, and then it might not be amiss to put a few sober and common-place questions to the members. He had the greatest respect for them; but as they had said that four could do very little against six hundred, he would ask whether the city paid no more taxes than in the proportion of four to six hundred;—*Applause.*—When every constable was liable to damages from having imprisoned falsely, what did they deserve who had been the occasion of the false imprisonment of so many? The worthy gentleman concluded his speech by observing that if their members were not what they wished, they might look out for four more honest men.

Mr. FAVELL then moved the resolutions.

Mr. WAITHMAN seconded the resolutions.

Mr. WOOLER moved a series of resolutions in an amendment.

Mr. HUNT, in reading the amendment, alluded to the trials at Derby. He would not defend the persons who were engaged in the riots that had taken place in that county; but they were only paupers instigated by the villain Oliver. They might have been convicted, one for murder, some for burglary, and some for robbery; but that would not do—they wanted convictions for high treason. They got the under-sheriff to pack a jury, in order to get them convicted and execated for high treason. Mr. Lockett had canvassed the neighbourhood, and examined who was on the right side and who was not, and then resigned the office of undersheriff, and became solicitor for the prosecution against all law and all justice. He got a jury of who had been terrified with Luddism, that they would have found the men guilty of bigamy had that been the charge against them. After the first verdict, the Judge rose up and said, "Gentlemen, I am very sorry that you have more cases to come before you; but, gentlemen, you have rendered an incalculable service to your country." He had heard the Judge use those expressions, and a juryman sitting beside him had said, "that's a pretty good hint to the rest of us, however!" but they were to be betrayed by their own counsel as well as by others: for one of them had promised to move an arrest of judgment which had never been done.

The amendments were put and negatived, and the original resolutions carried almost unanimously.

It was then agreed that petitions founded on the resolutions should be presented to both houses of Parliament, to the House of Commons by Mr. Alderman Wood, and the other city members were instructed to support the petition.

The thanks were then given to Mr. Favell and Mr. Waithman, for their services, and to the Lord Mayor for his conduct in the chair, and the Hall broke up.

The News (London) - Sunday 01 March 1818

...

Mr. WAITMAN seconded the resolutions. He said, the late Suspension Act passed certainly at an unprecedented period in every respect, and at no former period was so much oppression and injustice exercised under it—it was exercised in a manner as wanton, as it was cruel, for the unfortunate sufferers were discharged when it was found, *by the explosion of the spy system*, that they could not be brought to trial—not as they ought to have been discharged, in an unconditional manner, but upon harassing recognizances.—*[Hear.]* After this another Green Bag Committee was formed, which, even in the House of Commons itself, was called a humbug—*[A laugh,]*—for the persons composing it, to inquire into the conduct of Ministers, consisted of Ministers themselves, their placemen and pensioners, with a few solitary exceptions.—*[Hear, hear.]*

Mr. SCHULTES said, a suspension of the liberties of 12,000,000 of people called for a clear and unequivocal justification—*[Hear, hear.]*—and an inquiry could alone effect this purpose. Let the Ministers act on the good maxim, "Do unto others as you would others should do unto you."—*[Hear, hear.]*—He feared, however, that their plans were devised in a conclave where *female counsellors* had the chief sway. Be that as it may, the influence of the Livery of London in the expression of their opinion, must have powerful weight all over the country, and he was glad there was this opportunity of manifesting it.—*[Hear, hear.]*

Mr. WILLIAMS entreated the Livery would pause and wait for the result of a patient inquiry, before they passed a vote of censure on Ministers; before they decided they were wrong, let them first consider whether they were guilty. They were charged with hiring spies to convict innocent men.—*[Hear, hear.]* This was a great and heinous charge.—[*Hear, hear.]* Let us consider their private characters.—*[A laugh.]*—They have *passable* characters—*[A laugh]*—and would not be guilty of such conduct. Let any gentleman come forward on oath and prove the allegations against the Ministers, and then he would consent to a motion of the present—*[Here the uproar became so violent, that the worthy gentleman was obliged to desist.]*

Mr. WOOLER did not consider the resolutions strong enough; he, therefore, moved some additional ones.

Mr. HUNT seconded them. He stated his having been at Derby during the State Trials, and he firmly believed that had the unhappy sufferers there, been tried *before a London Jury*, they would have been acquitted. There was evidence sufficient, no doubt, to have convicted these men of burglary, of robbery, and one of them of murder; but this was not the kind of conviction desired by Ministers, nothing less than a conviction for *High Treason* being necessary for them, that they might have a case to justify the Habeas Corpus being suspended. He had no hesitation in saying, that the prisoners in that district had been tried before *a packed Jury*, for it was notorious, that Lockhart, then Under Sheriff, had procured a Jury of Farmers living in that district, who were of course, as might be expected, alarmed at the efforts and mal-practices of the Luddites. Having accomplished his purpose in this way (and how well he executed the task assigned him, might be easily guessed by the circumstance of not one of them being challenged by the Attorney or Solicitor-General,) he resigned the office of Under-Sheriff to a lad of the name of Simson, and became *Solicitor* for the prosecution. This was one instance of the manner in which these trials had been conducted. When the Jury were agreed on their verdict against Brandreth, and found him guilty, how did the Judge (Lord Chief Baron Richards) act? Why, he told them that *they had deserved well of their country*, that they had by their verdict rendered an incalculable service to their country, and that he should be happy to have had it in his power to discharge them. At the time these words were uttered from the Bench, he (Mr. H.) was sitting close by a Derby Juryman, who instantly said, *"Ah, there's a hint for us how to do our duty to the public."* He again expressed his decided conviction, that had the prisoners been tried in London by a dispassionate Jury, that verdict would not have been returned, but the object of Ministers was gained.

The amended resolutions were however negatived; and those moved by Mr. Favell passed by a great majority.—Adjourned.

Constitution (London) - Sunday 01 March 1818

[GIVES THE RESOLUTIONS]

Mr. FAVELL then moved the Resolutions, which were as follows:—

That this Common Hall has viewed with the deepest concern the frequent violations which have of late years been made upon the Rights of the Subject, more particularly by the late Suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act—a measure founded neither upon precedent nor necessity, but upon groundless alarms made by Ministers, through infamous and abandoned hired emissaries, for the purpose of stifling the complaints of the People—shielding corruption, and protecting abuses.

Resolved, That the existing Laws of the Land were fully sufficient for the suppression and punishment of acts of tumult and disorder, and were so considered by our ancestors, who passed the Habeas Corpus Act as an additional barrier for personal security, at a time remarkable for plots and alarms, and arbitrary and illegal arrests and imprisonments.

Resolved, That as the passing of the said Act in time of profound peace is without precedent—so is the wanton, arbitrary, and oppressive conduct of Ministers, under its Suspension, unexampled in the annals of the Country.

Resolved, That this Common Hall cannot sufficiently express its abhorrence of those detestable miscreants, who, as Spies and Informers, have been seeking to ensnare the lives of unfortunate Men, under the influence of want and despair, by exciting them to acts of treason and outrage. That the employment of such infamous Agents is disgraceful to the Government, destructive of social happiness and intercourse among the People, and putting the lives of innocent men in a state of peril and hazard.

Resolved, That this Meeting forbears to detail the numerous illegal arrests and detentions of Persons who have since been discharged without trial; nor will they recount the numerous cruel and vindictive prosecutions in which the Ministers have experienced signal defeat and disgrace. They cannot, however, but express their opinion, that in the instances where convictions have taken place, those deluded men were the victims of the hired Agents of the Government; and had it not been for the fortunate discovery of some of these wretches, hundreds of innocent men might have fallen a sacrifice to their artifices, frauds, and perjuries.

Resolved, That this Meeting has seen, with no less grief than indignation, Secret Parliamentary Committees, appointed at the suggestion of Ministers, composed of those Ministers, and other Placemen and Pensioners, for enquiry upon such ex-parte evidence as the Ministers find it convenient to furnish them—while the Petitions of those who complain of injustice and oppression have been refused even to be taken into consideration.

Resolved, That the object of such Committees, in the opinion of this Meeting, cannot tend to forward the ends of justice—to vindicate the violated Rights of the Subject—or to secure the People from oppression—but to screen, protect, and indemnify their Oppressors.

Resolved, That Petitions be presented to both Houses of Parliament, praying them immediately to institute such full, impartial, and rigid enquiry into the conduct of Ministers as can alone satisfy the justice of the Country, or the expectations of the People, by referring all the proceedings connected with the late Suspension Act, to a Committee, to be composed of such Members only as hold neither Place nor Pension under the Government; and that they will not pass any Bill of Indemnity to Ministers, and preclude those who have been the victims of oppression, from a fair appeal to the legal Tribunal of the Country.

Duckett's Dispatch - Monday 02 March 1818

MR. BENNETT presented a Petition from Benjamin Whiteley, who had been confined in Yorkshire under the Act for Suspending the Habeas Corpus, complaining of severity of treatment. Ordered to lie on the table.

Mr. BENNETT also presented a Petition of Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, near Huddersfield, stating that he had been arrested under the same Act, and confined in irons for five days and nights, in a cell with a person accused, and afterwards convicted, of murder, and with another person who had cut his throat; and complaining of other inflictions of severity, unwarranted by the nature of his case. The Honourable Member observed, that it was impossible for him to be responsible for the truth of these allegations, but that he felt it his duty to present the Petition.

The Petition was ordered to be printed.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 09 March 1818

In the House of Commons, on Thursday, there was another long debate, in which Lords Lascelles and Milton took part, respecting the proceedings of Ministers under the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, the employment and character of Oliver, and the allegations of the different persons who have been recently discharged from imprisonment.

Want of room to give even an intelligible abstract of the discussion, compels us merely to state, that the numerous fabrications and falsehoods of the party were again triumphantly refuted—that all the facts and reasoning on those subjects, which have appeared in this paper, during the past twelve months, were fully confirmed,—and that the characters and assertions of the *innocent gentlemen* who have been recently let loose again upon the Public, from Mitchell down to his friend Ben Scholes, of Wakefield, were placed in their proper colours before the House.

THOMAS RILEY.—From a feeling of repugnance to dragging the character of this wretched man, after his suicide, before the Public, we abstained from alluding to his case, till it had been so strangely brought under the notice of Parliament by Lord Milton. And as there have been some gross misrepresentations, it becomes a duty to put the Public in possession of accurate information respecting them.

If Mr. Michael Stocks had taken the trouble to apply to his own respectable relative, who resides near to the house which was occupied by Riley, he could not, with *truth*, have asserted to Lord Milton that he believed Riley was a respectable and loyal subject. On the contrary, he would have been convinced, like all to whom Riley was known, that he was one of the greatest firebrands in the whole neighbourhood.

Some time previous to the atrocious outrages of the Luddites, he had been admitted a Member of the High-street Chapel (in the Methodist Connection) Huddersfield. During his connection with this body, he became Treasurer and Secretary to the *Luddites*, in that district, and in other respects so notorious a character, that the Members of the Chapel waited on their Minister, and wished him to expel Riley from their Society. This the Minister declined to do, until some more formal accusation were brought against him, and supported by such proofs as would justify the measure.

Riley, hearing of this circumstance, went himself to thank the Minister for his favourable treatment; and, in the course of the conversation, admitted that he *did* fill the offices of Treasurer and Secretary to the Luddites, and that he was a *leader*,—attempting, however, at the same time, to justify his conduct, by stating that he did not coincide with those misguided men in principles, but that he was taking care of himself, by appropriating as much of their funds as he could to his own purposes!

Upon this avowal of consummate villany, the Minister no longer hesitated, and ordered him instantly to quit his house. Riley never afterwards attended the Chapel, as a Member.

These facts having been well known, and the man distinguishing himself, on all occasions, by the most malignant Jacobinism, he was, about the time the recent disturbances broke out, strongly suspected. After the affair at Folly-hall Bridge, near Huddersfield, he was apprehended in consequence of information upon oath; and being taken before the magistrates, he confessed where he himself had deposited a quantity of lead and a bullet mould. These were found, by persons sent for the purpose, in the spot Riley described, near a well, in a plantation belonging to Sir John Lister Kaye. He further stated, that he had the mould, &c. about his person, on the morning of the Sunday on which the rising took place—that he was in Huddersfield, waiting for the Manchester coach, by which he expected a Delegate, who was to come from that town to meet him—that while he was waiting for the coach, he saw Whitehead the constable, and was greatly alarmed, lest he should be then taken, and searched.—He further confessed, that they had made it up to murder Whitehead the constable, as well as several gentlemen, against none of whom, he allowed, he entertained any personal animosity.

Whitehead had observed his great agitation, when he saw him waiting for the coach, and watched him, till he saw him go into the Methodist chapel.

While in custody, he declared that if he were hung, he should be right served, as his conduct well deserved it.

Under these feelings of conscious guilt, and the horrible anticipation of a public execution, the wretched man, before he was taken from Huddersfield, suspended himself from his bedstead, and was nearly dead when found in that situation.

A medical gentleman, of Huddersfield, of the first respectability, attended the examination of Riley before the Magistrates, and pronounced him to be of perfectly sound mind.

But the torments of his guilty conscience could not be endured; and, in York Castle, with a razor purloined from a fellow prisoner, he accomplished the dreadful act of self-destruction, which he had failed to effect at Huddersfield.

We are in possession of many facts respecting his past life, but we wish not to rake up more than are sufficient to shew the kind of grounds on which Mr. Michael Stocks can prevail on Lord Milton to obtrude  upon Parliament causeless complaints of the conduct of Ministers.

The fellow-prisoner of Riley, Richard Lee, has lived to send up a string of misrepresentations as to his own treatment. The following documents, being his position, the deposition of Richard Carlson, observations, &c. unveil another of the vile outrages offerred to the dignity and good sense of the Legislature.

HOUSE OF COMMONS

[Appendix.] No.48

*Mercurii 25 die Februarii, 1818.*

A petition of Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, in the parish of Kirkburton, and County of York, was presented and read; setting forth, that the Petitioner is by trade a clothier, and hath never committed any crimes against the laws and country, being in every case a true subject of His Majesty King George; that on 13th June 1817, a number of men entered his house, with one *Matthew Bradley* at their head, while the Petitioner was at his work; and the said *M. Bradley* said, in a very insulting manner to the Petitioner, "You must go along with us;" the Petitioner replied, "Very well, but you will let me wash and clean myself first;" when the Petitioner had so done, the said *Matthew Bradley* drew a pistol out of his pocket, and said he would blow the Petitioner's brains out; they then took the Petitioner to an inn near his own house, where he begged to speak to his wife respecting his affairs; but, when she came for that purpose, the said *Bradley* said, the Petitioner must go immediately to Huddersfield, as they were ready and would not wait, and that she, meaning the Petitioner's wife, might follow the Petitioner to Huddersfield if they had any thing to say together; to which town they dragged the Petitioner, guarded by a number of ?? soldiers, and lodged him in a stinking dungeon without a bed or fire, although the Petitioner was wet through; that when the Petitioner’s wife came afterwards to see the petitioner next day to Huddersfield, at great charge and hazard, in her situation, being then unwell with a complaint in her breast, which was afterwards cut for a cancer; she was not allowed to see the Petitioner at all; that on the next morning, in this uncomfortable state of mind and body, ill at ease on account of his family, he was brought some refreshment, but he could not eat, and about noon he was taken before a Magistrate, *Mr. B. H. Allen*, who said that the Petitioner was charged with High Treason, and must be hanged; whereupon the Petitioner said, "You make my case very black, it is time to be prepared I think;" he replied, "Yes it is:" about the hour of seven o’clock in the evening, the Petitioner said, "Is't not dinner time?" to this *Mr Thomas Atkinson*, who was present, said, "You shall have your dinner in my room, and sleep in it also:" the Petitioner replied that would be very acceptable, as he had no sleep the last night, but the said *Atkinson* then said, "You must make a man of yourself, and tell me all you know;" to which the Petitioner replied, as the truth was, "I know nothing;" that the said B. H. Allen then called the said Atkinson aside, and said, as the Petitioner could hear, "We must tow?er Lee again;" so, about eight o’clock, the Petitioner was remanded to the dungeon again, and about ten o'clock they came and began searching him while he was fast asleep, owing to his fatigue and want of rest: but being awoke by the search, the Petitioner asked, "What are you about?" but no answer was given to him, and they returned to him a three-shilling piece they had taken from his pocket just as he awoke, and kept him in this offensive dungeon five successive nights, and would not permit his wife to speak to him during that time, nor was he allowed to see her for three weeks afterwards: that the Petitioner was afterwards put into an empty room, where he remained six days without any bed or bedding, save only a handful of straw to lie upon, but no covering of any sort whatsoever but his own clothes that he had on: that on the 16th of July he was removed to York Castle like a felon, and ironed, in which state he was kept during the whole of his confinement, being twenty weeks and two days, five days of which time he was obliged to live in the same place, and sleep in the same room and bed with a man charged and afterwards executed for murder, with no other allowance than that of the prison, namely, bread and sixpence per week for nine weeks: that one *Thomas Riley*, confined in the same cell with the Petitioner, on a similar charge of a suspicion of High Treason, no doubt in a fit of derangement of mind, brought on by his confinement, cut his throat in the said prison, and on the day following, the Petitioner and another prisoner whom the Petitioner understood to be a convicted felon, were removed unto the very same cell in which the said *Riley* cut his throat, while the blood of the said *Riley* was still lying all over the floor, in a hard and congealed state: and the Petitioner and the said other prisoner were compelled to clean the same out with only a mop and broom, which,not being sufficient to remove the said blood, the Petitioner was obliged to scrape and take it up with his hands: that by this treatment his affairs and health are very much injured: to remedy things as far as he was able, he signed on the 5th of December a paper called a recognisance, although unconscious of any offence: wherefore, the Petitioner's circumstances being in a ruined state, and his health declining, he is led to pray for such relief as to the wisdom of the House shall seem meet: and that the House will cause inquiry to be made into the conduct of those by whom the Petitioner has been so cruelly treated, and will not pass any Bill of Indemnity to screen them from answering at Law for such unjust treatment of the Petitioner."

In the matter of the Petition of *Richard Lee*, late a prisoner in His Majesty's Gaol. the Castle of York.

*Richard Carlton*, of Full Sutton, in the East Riding of the County of York, late a prisoner under *sentence of confinement* in the Castle of York aforesaid, *maketh oath and saith*, that he was confined in the same room, along with, the above named *Richard Lee* and one *Thomas Riley*, now deceased, and had been so confined with them for the period of three weeks, previous to the time of the said *Thomas Riley* putting a period to his existence by cutting his throat: and this deponent also saith, that when he, *this deponent*, and the said *Richard Lee*, discovered what had taken place, which might to about *five* o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, the *seventh day of October* now last past. He, this deponent, called to the *watchmen*, who immediately called the *turnkey* and the *deputy gaoler*, all of whom came to the room, where he, *this deponent*, and the said *Richard Lee* and *Thomas Riley were confined*, when* Mr. Samuel Wilson*, deputy to *Mr. William Staveley*, the gaoler or keeper of the said castle, desired this deponent to lay the said *Thomas Riley* in a straight position on the bed, in which he was then laying, and undressed, which request he, this deponent, *immediately complied with*, that the said *Samuel Wilson*, *William Mentoft[?], the Turnkey*, and the *Watchman*, then withdrew, in order, as this deponent believes, to *send for the surgeon*: that the said *William Mentoft* returned to them in about ten minutes after or a quarter of an hour, and *conducted this deponent and the said Richard Lee* to another apartment, nearly adjoining to the room, in which they were then confined; that the said *William Mentoft* then left them, and again returned in about ten minutes more, when he asked the deponent, if he would have the goodness to clean up the blood in the room, in which the said Thomas Riley was then laying, previous to the Coroner and Jury being brought in: at the same time, saying that he, this deponent, should be recompensed for his trouble, and this deponent further saith, that he, this deponent, accordingly cleaned up the blood himself, without any assistenace from the said Richard Lee, or an other person or persons whomsoever. And that the said Richard Lee did not assist, nor to this deponent's knowledge and belief, was ever required to assist in any way whatever to clean the room, or to do any other thing about the said Thomas Riley.

(Signed) RICHARD CARLTON.  
Sworn before me, Thomas C. R. Read, one of the visiting Magistrates at the Castle, at York, March 4th, 1818.

Observations by Mr. Allis, Clerk to the Magistrates, at Huddersfield, on the first part of Richard Lee's Petition.

Bradley, and Blythe, the Holmfirth Constable, went together: Blythe left Bradley to take care of Lee; no insult or abuse happened, but after Blythe went away, Lee said to Bradley, "you need not be afraid of my running away." Bradley replied, "No, you had better not attempt it, for if you do I will blow your brains out," or something to that effect.—"Bradley told this, because when Blythe was gone, he had no assistance, and was himself lame, having lost a foot.

Lee and his wife did talk about Lee's business and affairs, and he gave many directions about his business, and Bradley waited for a quarter of an hour. When Lee had changed his clothes, and arranged with his wife about his affairs, he told her that she might follow him to Huddersfield, either that day or the day following, and then they set off; he was not hurried away.

He was lodged in the best prison, which Huddersfield affords (which certainly is not the best or largest in the world). There was clean fresh straw every day, and it was daily washed, and watered by the constable. It was very hot weather at the time, and no one could be cold. His wife was told, that she could not see him without a magistrate's order. She afterwards applied to the magistrate, and did see him often.

Lee offered repeatedly to tell all he knew, if he might be permitted to be admitted as evidence, but he was told, that no promise could be made to him.

The place was not offensive, but clean and dry. As soon as ever a place of better accommodation could be found for the numerous prisoners, viz. in three or four days time, a house was taken, and Lee was then put into the best front bed room, with a chest of drawers, and a four post flock bed. He refused to have a bed, and wished for some straw. Straw was given him, and he put it upon his bed, and threw two quilts over it, and so crept in between them, because the weather was so intensely warm. All this was his own choice, and he repeatedly declared, that he was, and had been, more comfortable than at home, and had been much better attended to, and fed.

Observationsby the Gaoler, at York, on Lee's Petition.

*Richard Lee*, whilst confined in York Castle, by his good and regular conduct, induced the gaoler to recommend him to Lord Sidmouth for his release. The gaoler was then led to believe Lee possessed some contrition in his mind for the offences which he had so frequently confessed to him, of his guilt, against the laws of his country: and under the faithful ?? of reformation, the gaoler was induced to petition Lord Sidmouth, in Lee's behalf.

On the day Lee left the castle, he addressed the Rev. Wm. Dealtry, one of the visiting magistrates, and expressed himself highly satisfied with the treatment he had received during his confinement, which he never failed to do whatever the Jailer conversed with him.

Both Riley and Lee were visited by the Grand Jury, on their inspection of the gaol, and no complaints were made. They had at all times access to their friends and relations. Their attendance at chapel was five times a week.

During the time Lee was confined, viz. twenty weeks, he had a single iron upon his right ancle, for the security of his person, weighing about five pounds, which is the usual practice of the gaol, and highly necessary in that part of the prison where Lee was confined.

His allowance (as directed by the Magistrates), was 1 1/2 pound loaf of good standard wheaten bread, *every morning*, with 6d. every Saturday to purchase some potatoes with. Coals found by the county, and in addition to the above allowance, 7s. 6d. per week, with which he frequently expressed himself well satisfied and thankful. He had every opportunity to obtain any other comfort he pleased (except liquor) of which one pint or bottle of ale was allowed. On his first arrival he was confined in the first yard, where only persons convicted of *small crimes and misdemeanors* are confined.

He was afterwards removed into a large room with Riley.—Wm. King was also confined in it, charged with the murder of his wife, and attended by two confiners, (not felons) who were well informed persons, and who, by the chaplain's direction, read good books to him. *King* was only *five* days in *Lee's* company, and no other felon was put in the same room with *Lee* during his confinement. He was allowed to walk, whenever he desired, in the yard allotted to prisoners in execution for small fines.

The room occupied by Riley and Lee, is 23ft. long, 13 1/2 f. wide, 15ft. high, and a fire place in the centre, so that the prisoner may have a fire day and night if he wished it. The day-room adjoining, is a long passage, 27f. long, 6f. wide, and 15f. high, and well ventilated.

Lee looked extremely well when he was discharged.

*Benjamin Whitely*, another of the band of *Patriots* who intended for us som many blessings, is the subject of the following letter:—

*To the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer*  
Holmfirth, 2d March 1818

Holmfirth, 2d March 1818.

Sir,—I am surprized, not a little, to find that our neighbour, Whitely, has been handing a Petition to the House of Commons, thro' the medium of the Hon. Mr. Bennett, for redress of grievances &c. and complaining of ill treatment during his confinement under the suspension act—'tis a pity but Mr. Bennett or any other Hon. Member would make themselves acquainted with the merit or demerit of any case, before such arrant trash as a petition from characters like Benj. Whitely, should be forced upon the notice of the House of Commons.

It is a fact generally known here, that during his confinement, Whitely in his letters to his wife, frequently boasted of kind treatment—to my certain knowledge, in one letter, dated Worcester, after stating what passed when he had an *interview* with Lord Sidmouth, &c. he goes on to say—I am now as happy as I could wish, if I had but your company—I have tea or coffee for breakfast—fresh dressed meat every day for dinner, with ale or porter at my option, an excellent bed, comfortable room, yard to walk in, &c. he further says, that as he is treated like a gentleman, he wishes to appear as such, and requests his wife to send him his best cloaths—All this he has confirmed since his return, adding that he had three pounds or guineas given him when he started to convey him home—and I am sure, if one may judge from his appearance, he has done well.

I apprehend, many of the complaints we hear of, are as ill-founded as this; and I think it right the Country should be properly informed. If this communication is of any service, I shall be glad, and, tho' you will omit noticing the author, I shall at any time be ready to offer most satisfactory proofs of its authenticity, if required.

+++

Amongst our authentic anecdotes of the late treasonable outrages, and our authentic narrative of the whole progress of the conspiracy, it will be remembered, we stated that Mr. Denman, Counsel for the prisoners, alluded to Old Tom Bacon, (one of the conspirators), and not to Oliver, in those observations in which he seemed to call upon the Attorney General to bring forth the principal agitator whose machinations had disturbed the peace of the country, and brought so many unfortunate men to trial for their lives. For this fact, we immediately had the dogs of sedition in full yell upon us. The Leicester Chronicle gave us the lie direct. The Leeds Mercury both denounced us as liars and demanded our authority. We are not in the practice of giving the names of persons furnishing information, especially to please those who are not to be convinced. But, as Mr. Bennett, in one of his recent speeches on the state of the country, confirmed the fact, he may, perhaps, feel more disposed to gratify the jacobin press than we are, by communicating the author of his information.

Mr. Bennett said, "if Bacon had been tried first, Oliver would have been a most important witness. He (Mr. Bennett) knew that Bacon's trial would have had a most important effect on those of the other prisoners, and that was the reason why that master traitor had been kept back altogether."

While we thank Mr. Bennett for this proof, that it was Bacon whom the Counsel for the prisoners wished to be brought forward, and for his admission that Bacon (one of the *innocent victims* to Oliver) was a *"master traitor,"* we beg leave to set him right in some particulars. Bacon was not kept back altogether. He pleaded *guilty*—was *convicted*—and in common with some others who thus threw themselves on the mercy of the Crown, was sentenced to *transportation for life*.

The Solicitor General and others, in the course of the same debate, clearly proved that Oliver had nothing to do with the prisoners, and that his production could have been of no advantage to them. And, the reason Bacon was called for so often by the Counsel for the prisoners, was, not that they thought they
could have availed themselves of Oliver during his trial; but because they imagined the Attorney-General was keeping Bacon back, for the purpose of using him as an evidence in some further proceedings.

We believe the chief reason that Brandreth, Ludlam, Turner, and Weightman, were put on their trials before Bacon, was, that though Bacon was certainly one of the *"master traitors,"* the legal proofs were not quite so strong against him as against some of the others—and this very circumstance was a further motive for the prisoners' Counsel to wish him to be tried *first*. If the *master traitor* Bacon had been tried
first, and, from any defect of evidence, had been acquitted, it would have had a most *important*, and
*glorious*, and *ever-to-be-rejoiced-at* effect on the trials of the *other traitors*—certainly.—The Attorney General, happily, *knew his business better*.

Lord LASCELLES rose merely for the purpose of communicating some circumstances to prove that the allegations contained in a petition, presented to the House some days ago, from a person of the name of Richard Lee, who had been confined in York Castle, were totally unfounded. He was the more anxious to make these statements to the House, because the character of a very respectable person, who filled the office of gaoler to York Castle, was implicated in the story of the petitioner whom he had named. The petitioner stated that he had, during his confinement, been treated with the utmost cruelty, loaded with fetters, placed among felons, stinted of food, and that when the unfortunate person of the name of Riley confined along with him, driven to phrenzy by the hardships to which he was exposed in the prison, had put an end to his existence by cutting his throat, he had been obliged *with his own hands* to lift and carry out the congealed blood from the floor of the cell. To refute those statements he would read to the House a letter from a most respectable person, (whose name could not be heard) and also an affidavit. The letter stated that Lee, in the presence of the writer, had acknowledged with contrition that he had been guilty of the offence for which he had been arrested; that in consequence of his contrition and promises of amendment he had been discharged. That after his discharge he had, in presence of the Rev. William Dawtry, the visiting Magistrate, stated, that he was perfectly satisfied with the treatment he had experienced during his confinement. That instead of being loaded with fetters he had only a single iron on his left ancle, which was usual in such cases. That during his confinement, in addition to the usual prison allowance of bread, and sixpence a week, and coals, he was, by order of Lord Sidmouth, supplied with seven shillings and sixpence a-week. That he had only been confined five days in the same room with a felon. That Riley, who committed suicide, was not driven to phrenzy by the hardships which he suffered in jail, but had been deranged, and attempted to commit suicide before his confinement in York Castle. The affidavit was made by William Charlton, and stated that the deponent was confined, in company with the Petitioner, Lee, for three weeks previous to the suicide of Riley. That after Riley had cut his throat, the Petitioner, Lee, asked the Deponent to clean up the blood which was on the floor previous to the Coroner and Jury viewing the body; and that in compliance with Lee's request, the Deponent cleaned out the blood with his own hands, without any assistance from the said Richard Lee. The Noble Lord said, that he only troubled the House with these facts to shew how unfounded the statements in the Petition were, and because it was due to the respectable persons complained against by the Petition that the House should know the truth.

Sir F. BURDETT said, that the sort of testimony which the Noble Lord (Lascelles) had brought forward was such as the House ought not to receive. Nothing was more unsatisfactory than to have letters produced, and read in contradiction to statements contained in petitions.— If the facts stated in the Petition were fit to be objects of debate, a proper inquiry ought to be instituted, that so the truth or falsehood of them might be satisfactorily proved. With respect to the Bill before the House, he was surprised to hear an Hon. Gentleman say he voted in favour of it on the authority of Mr. Ponsonby, when it was well known that Mr. Ponsonhy voted against the suspension of the Habeas Corpus. But indeed some strange things had come out during the debates on this Bill. Amongst other things it had been said that Mr. Cobbett was the cause of the disturbances last year, which brought on the suspension of the liberty of the subject. If this were true, it was very strange that with all the boasted talent of the present day the arguments of Cobbett had not been refuted. Ministers said that those who talked of reform meant revolution.— The truth was, that this was said for the purpose of opposing Parliamentary Reform, and continuing the corruptions of this House. It seemed to him almost impossible that the House should pass this Bill, but he should reserve his arguments till he saw in what shape the Bill should come out of the Committee.

Royal Cornwall Gazette - Saturday 14 March 1818

Thomas Riley. — The *Leeds Intelligencer* says: "In the *Mercury* we have upwards of a column chiefly respecting Riley, the object of which is to make it appear that that unhappy wretch was unjustly charged with high treason, and that he put an end to his existence in York Castle, on the 7th of October last, not from feelings of conscious guilt, but in consequence of the hardships to which he was subjected by his imprisonment. In reply to all this trash, it is only necessary to state, that before Riley was imprisoned at York, that is, on the day after his apprehension at Huddersfield, in June last, he attempted to hang himself."

Public Ledger and Daily Advertiser - Wednesday 25 March 1818

RICHARD LEE.— The following account is given in the *Leeds Intelligencer* of an investigation, at the recent Quarter Sessions, at York, respecting the contents of Richard Lee's Petition to the House of Commons:—

"We have more than once alluded to the Petition to the House of Commons of *Richard Lee*, of Holmfirth, one of the men apprehended under the Suspension Act, in which the Petitioner complains of the injustice of his arrest, and of cruel and vindictive treatment during his imprisonment in York Castle. The deservedly high character of Mr. Staveley, Governor of the Castle, and the well-known excellent management of the prison, were alone sufficient to repel the aspersions of *Lee*. But, we are happy to state, that *Lee* himself has been personally examined, and that the result has been that of indelibly stamping the allegations of his Petition as false. At the General County Sessions, holden on the 12th inst. at York, it was agreed upon by above 70 Magistrates, that a Committee should be appointed for the purpose of thoroughly investigating the case. He accordingly appeared, in consequence of notice sent to him express, before 15 Magistrates, who assembled at the Castle on Monday last; and who in vain endeavoured to draw from him any charge against Mr. Staveley, or against the worthy Gentleman's management of the prison, or any complaint as to the treatment received by himself while in his custody. In the face of the audacious assertions contained in his own Petition, he now denied that he had ever made any complaint against Mr. Staveley, or that he had any complaint to offer.— Scarce any other answer to questions could be obtained from him, but that his complaint was against those who had caused his imprisonment, *who were not there to vindicate themselves*, and not against Mr. Staveley, who *had the means of refuting his former assertions*. The Magistrates, very properly, were not satisfied with those answers, but proceeded, notwithstanding, to a most strict and careful examination of the most minute charges contained in the Petition.—The result was the utter confusion of Lee, who cut a most despicable figure during the examination, it being ascertained beyond a doubt, that his treatment had been in every respect humane—and that the only step taken for the security of his person, had been to put a single iron upon one of his legs—a precaution which the exposed situation of the gaol rendered indispensable.

PARLIAMENTARY PETITIONERS.

The infamous falsehoods upon which most of the Petitions to the House of Commons, from wretches who attempted to subvert the Government of the Country, were founded, would make us wonder that any persons should degrade themselves and insult the Legislature by presenting them, if we did not know the influence of Party. Among others of a similar kind was one presented on the case of RICHARD LEE, and of that we may say *ex uno disce omnes*. But as facts are the best arguments, we shall avail ourselves of the information afforded us in a Provincial Journal, to which we have often been indebted, and which is conducted with such spirit, energy, and true patriotism, as to entitle it to the approbation of Ministers and the esteem of the country. The following is extracted from *The Leeds Intelligencer* of yesterday:—

"TO OUR READERS.

Sir Francis Burdett having given notice, that h"e shall bring BEN SCHOLES's Petition before the House of Commons, after the recess, we think proper to defer our refutation of it till that period."

"In the Intelligencer of the 9th inst. it will be recollected we inserted a copy of the petition to the House Of Commons, of Richard Lee, of Holmfirth, one of the men apprehended under the Suspension Act, in which the petitioner complains of the injustice of his arrest, and of cruel and vindictive treatment during his imprisonment at York Castle.

"Though the deservedly high character of Mr. Stavely, Governor of the Castle, and the well-known excellent management of the prison, were alone sufficient to repel the aspersions of Lee, we accompanied the publication of his petition with several documents, which completely proved the falsehood of his allegations.

"It having been insinuated, however, by some, that the evidence was all on one side, we are happy to state that Lee himself has been personally examined, and that the result has been that of indelibly stamping the allegations of his petition as false.

"At the General County Sessions, holden on 12th inst. at York, it was agreed upon, by above seventy Magistrates, that a Committee should be appointed, for the purpose of thoroughly investigating his case. He accordingly appeared, in consequence of notice sent to him express, before 15 Magistrates, who assembled at the Castle on Monday last; and who in vain endeavoured to draw from him any charge against Mr. Stavely, or against that worthy gentleman's management of the Prison, or any complaint as to the treatment received by himself while in his custody. In the face of the audacious assertions contained in his own petition, he now denied that he had ever made any complaint against Mr. Stavely, or that he had any complaint to offer: Scarce any other answer to questions could be obtained from him, but that his complaint was against those who caused his imprisonment, who were not there to vindicate themselves, and not against Mr. Stavely, who had the means of refuting his former assertions. The Magistrates, very properly, were not satisfied with those answers, but proceeded, notwithstanding, to a most strict and careful examination of the most minute charges contained in the Petition.

"The result was to the utter confusion of Lee, who cut a most despicable figure during the examination, it being ascertained beyond a doubt, that his treatment had been in every respect humane—" and that the only step taken for the security of his person had been to put a single iron upon one of his legs, a precaution which the exposed situation of the gaol rendered indispensable.

"Thus it is with the cases of those worthy *Patriots* when their vile fabrications are put to the  test. Contemptible as the men themselves are, we think the Members of the Legislature who have condescended to re-echo their falsehoods within the walls of Parliament have debased themselves still lower."

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 28 March 1818

HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION.

The following communications have been handed to us for insertion, by the persons whose signatures they bear:—

CASE OF THOMAS RILEY.

MR. EDITOR,—As a brother of the late Thomas Riley, I feel myself compelled to make a few remarks upon the charges so *reluctantly*, although copiously exhibited against him in the *Leeds Intelligencer* of Monday, the 9th inst. In answer to the charge of disloyalty contained therein, I beg leave to subjoin a copy of the petition, numerously signed by some of the first people in and about Huddersfield, and presented to Lord Sidmouth in August last, by Mr. Barclay, M.P.

[Here follows the petition, in which it is stated that Thomas Riley "has, for the last fifteen years, resided near Huddersfield, and borne a good character, and has supported a wife and nine children, in a respectable manner, by his own industry, and strict application to his trade of a tailor, and that he has conducted himself in a loyal and peaceable manner during that period. That he had since been apprehended on an unknown charge. That his bodily and mental health had, in consequence, suffered extremely, and that his further detention must entail ruin upon a respectable and industrious man, his wife and family."]

I now beg leave most positively to contradict the statement contained in the Intelligencer, of my brother having been treasurer and secretary to the *Luddites*; nor do I believe he had any concern whatever with them; neither was High Street Chapel built until *nearly two years after Luddism had received its death-blow*, and of course as there was no Chapel at that place, there could be no minister to apply to.

Having thus detected one palpable fabrication, I now call upon the Editor of the Intelligencer, or his informants, for a copy of the information upon oath, whereon he, Thomas Riley, was apprehended, and also for a copy of his confession as to the lead and bullet mould; because, though an assertion of this nature is easily made, *after the death* of the individual accused, when the accuser knows it cannot be answered, it will not be found quite so easy to prove it. My late brother informed me that the moulds in question were never used nor deposited by him in the place mentioned; that he never was a delegate, nor acted in any manner hostile to the interests of his king and country; and I believe he never made use of the words stated in the Intelligencer, that as if he was hung he was right served, as his conduct merited it. Oppression will drive a man mad; and what his oppressors may say, or what they might force him to say I cannot tell, but this I learnt from his own lips, that, during the time he was in custody at Huddersfield, and during *the reign of terror* at that place, he had a pistol placed to his head, with a threat of blowing out his brains, if he did not confess more than he *knew to be true!* At one time, when I was at Huddersfield, my late brother called from the window of the prison, where he was confined, and asked "how his mother was," to which I answered, "as well as can be expected" for which answer I was threatened, by the soldiers guarding the door, that if I spoke another word they would apprehend me:—in consequence of which threat I was prevented from speaking another word more to my brother. On the 4th of July last he was committed to York Castle, and expected taking his trial at the ensuing Assizes, preparatory to which he was furnished with a document, being a notice of a bill or bills of indictment which would be preferred against him, a copy of which I now insert.

[Want of room obliges us to omit the bill of indictment, but it charged him with shooting at George Whitehead, and the commission of several burglaries and robberies. These charges his enemies knew they could not substantiate. They shrunk from the test, and covered their shame by a Secretary of State's warrant.]

The Editor of the Intelligencer has further stated that Thomas Riley had, for years, been employed in planning conspiracy, *but carefully avoided taking an active part therein*. He had been for years engaged in acts subversive of the peace of society, and in violation of the laws of his country, yet he was never brought to trial. What a fine compliment is this to the vigilance of the Magistrates! But it is utterly false. If it be not, what is the evidence of the fact? Is it in the Office of the Leeds Intelligencer? or is only on the despicable and cowardly minds of the defamers of the dead? I am Sir, yours &c.

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 28 March 1818

CASE OF BENJAMIN WHITELEY.

MR. EDITOR,—Please to insert the following observations on an anonymous letter, published in the Leeds Intelligencer of the 9th inst. from a man calling himself my *neighbour*:—(and he may be the neighbour "to him that fell among thieves," but that he is not the *good Samaritan* his conduct sufficiently proves.) In my neighbour's letter, the conduct of Mr. Bennett, for "forcing upon the House of Commons trash petitions," without inquiring into the merit or demerit of the character of the petitioners, is condemned. Mr. Bennett's character stands above the reach of this traducer's malevolence; and as to my character, it would not, I am sure, suffer, on a comparison with that of a man who is ashamed of his name. Both my character and my conduct have stood the test, for if either of them could have been impugned, is it likely that my cruel persecutors would have relinquished their prosecution, and dismissed me without trial? I believe few men will say that the milk of human kindness is to be found in such breasts. Their tender mercies are cruel, and woe be to the man that stands in need of their clemency.

I mention the Honourable Mr. Bennett with the most profound regard;—he is a rare sight, "an honest man amid a crowd of sycophants." Mr. Bennett merely did his duty to his fellow-subject in presenting my petition, and, as a member of the legislature could not lawfully refuse it. And will *my neighbour*, the Priest, or the Levite, undertake to say that Mr. Bennett did not acquaint himself with my character? In my petition I complained of hard and unmanly usage at Wakefield and Salisbury, and of my wife and friends being refused to see or speak with me at Worcester. I did not petition with a design to hurt the creatures appointed to do such drudgery, but to shew the injustice done, in my person, to the laws of my country. I pointed out my loss of health and of business, but said nothing even of the distressed situation of my wife, for to move compassion was not my design:—no; pity I abhor, and justice I have a right to demand.

My design, in this address, is to warn my countrymen how, in future, they deliver innocent men into the hands of malicious and interested tyrants; and I am ready, when lawfully called, and when a prospect of redress presents itself, to prove, that every word, in my petition, was true; and to shew that I endured such treatment, not even hinted at in my petition, as would make the hair of my nameless *neighbour* stand erect, if a slavish disposition had not steeled his heart. But why does the coward conceal his name? Is it that, judging from his own wicked heart, he fears the consequence? Or am I to suppose that the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer is himself the fabricator of this precious production? Such a supposition I have no right to entertain, for when I applied to him, as I did in person, for the name of my traducer, he refused to give it up, thereby shewing the *sincerity* of the boasted readiness of the slanderer to stand forward, in his proper person; or rather, shewing his consciousness that he has dealt in calumny, and, like his betters, shrinks from responsibility.—I am, your obedient servant,
BENJAMIN WHITELEY.

Sun (London) - Monday 30 March 1818

The Editor of *The Leeds Mercury* has favoured us with a copy of his Paper of Saturday last, and, no doubt, intended for our instruction, has marked a long paragraph, probably of his own writing, on the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Poor Laws, and on the cruel treatment of persons arrested under the Habeas Corpus Suspension, who, poor souls! merely aimed at the destruction of Government; directing our attention likewise to two letters in e same day's Paper—one from the Brother of the late THomas RILEY, and another signed BENJAMIN WHITELY. The Editor's own paragraph seems to be nothing more than a transfer of hackneyed topics, we will not honour them with the name of arguments, from the factious columns of *The Morning Chronicle*. The letter from RILEY's Brother, of course, *vindicates* his memory, and asserts that he never uttered the words imputed to him, viz.: "if he was hung be was right served, as his conduct merited it." All we shall say on this posthumous denial is, that we can sympathize in the feelings of a surviving brother, but that "dead men tell no tales." As to the letter from BENJAMIN WHITELY, it consists chiefly of a panegyric on Mr. BENNET, M. P. We are content that Mr. BENNET should have such eulogists, but we shall be glad to find that he will not in future *expose* himself to their *praise*.

York Herald - Saturday 18 April 1818

To the Editor of the York Herald,

Sir,  
My numerous friends being very desirous to know the result of the Investigation that has lately taken place in consequence of Richard Lee's petition to the House of Commons, I hope I shall not be thought of acting improperly, to intrude upon the public, in refutation of the vile attack on my character, by stating, that upon the conclusion of the personal inquiry of the said Richard Lee, by the Committee of Magistrates deputed for that purpose, the Chairman read to me, by their desire, the Report they were about to make, and which as far as my memory serves, was in substance, that they were unanimously of opinion, that no blame whatever attached to me or any of those under my orders, but that considering the important duty I had to perform, the treatment of Richard Lee, in York Castle, was in every respect humane and proper. I hope I may also be further allowed to state, that Richard Lee, in my hearing (during his examination), declared to the Magistrates that he had no complaint whatever to make against me, nor did he ever mean to do so, although the Copy of his Petition was at that time read over to him.

In hopes the subject will at some convenient opportunity, be brought forward again in the House of Commons, I beg to subscribe myself, Sir,  
Your obedient humble Servant,  
Wm. STAVELEY.  
Keeper of York Castle.  
April 15, 1818

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 27 April 1818

ALso in : https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000498/18180502/016/0004 York Herald - Saturday 02 May 1818

To the Editor of the Leeds Intelligencer.

Sir—With considerable pain and indignation, I have of late perused the several publications in the columns of the Leeds Mercury, with the names of Richard Lee, and Benjamin Whiteley, affixed to them, who are residents in my parish, at Holmfirth, which certainly tend not only to mislead, but also to inflame, the public mind against his Majesty's Government, and to the manifest prejudice of individuals who are attached to it. Nothing short of an imperious sense of my public duty could induce me to meddle in an affair of this nature, which, otherwise, would prove extremely adverse to my feelings, and be incompatible with that forbearance, which it peculiarly becomes a clergyman to practise. The facts I am about to relate, I am ready also to substantiate by oath, should I be legally required so to do; therefore I will not be tempted to notice, much less to answer, any comment thereon, that may be made by the aforesaid Richard Lee, Benjamin Whiteley, or their co-adjutors.—First, to the case of Richard Lee.

A few days previous to his liberation from York Castle, his wife called on me to request I would write to my Lord Sidmouth in behalf of her husband, that he might be one of the first of the State Prisoners, whom his Majesty's Government proposed to liberate. I positively refused to interfere in an affair, in which I could have no influence, and added, independently of this objection, I knew Richard Lee her husband's conduct to have been so very reprehensible, that I was determined to have nothing to do with him, directly or indirectly. She in reply observed, I had no need to be afraid of appearing her husband's friend, since the Governor of York Castle (wherein he was then confined) had formed a very favourable opinion of him, from his uniform good behaviour within the walls, treated him with great kindness, and *(mark what follows)* even had promised to write in conjunction with the Chaplain of the Prison, to Lord Sidmouth, in his *behalf* and *commendation*, or in words to this effect. Now, if this representation made by his wife, of the indulgent and compassionate treatment he experienced in York Castle, be compared with Mr. Staveley's statement of the same (as it appears in your weekly paper of 20th inst.) of whom I have not the slightest knowledge, but by name, they do so intimately correspond and assimilate, that I think the veracity of Richard Lee's petition to the House of Commons, complaining of ill treatment, when in the Castle of York, must fall to the ground; not only so, but also in the opinion of every upright man, must impute to him the vilest ingratitude to his benefactors. And with respect to Richard Lee's alleged innocency of conduct, let the following tale suffice, which designates the man in his proper colours.

Some weeks before the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was renewed, a man knocked at the kitchen door of my house about nine o'clock in the evening, when it was very dark; on the door being opened by my wife, he put a paper into her hand, desiring it might be delivered to myself, and decamped speedily in great haste. The paper so delivered was Hone's infamous parody on the Litany of the Church of England. The next day I readily traced out the individual who sent it to me, and *where* it had been purchased, even at the house of Richard Lee. I repaired thither immediately, accompanied by a person to witness what might pass on the occasion. I saw his wife, and enquired if Richard Lee sold the *aforesaid parody?*—she unhesitatingly answered, Yes, he *had such like on sale*. Richard Lee did not make his appearance.

I come now to speak of Benjamin Whiteley, of Holmfirth, Cloth-drawer. His wife, a very respectable woman in her general conduct, came to me a very few days after her husband had been lodged in Salisbury Gaol. She exhibited to me a letter written by him to herself, stating his arrival at that prison; that he was well treated in being supplied with excellent food and plenty of it; that at the time he was writing, the gaoler was conveying into his apartment a good bed, clean blankets, &c. &c. and he seemed to lament only his loss of liberty. She also wished me to write to my Lord Sidmouth, urging the immediate trial of her husband, a request too ridiculous to be complied with. On his subsequent removal to Worcester Gaol, and being unwell, she (his wife) went to see him. On her return to Holmfirth, she informed me, an interview with him had been denied her. She had however ascertained before she left him, either by message or letter, (I cannot now recollect which) that he was much recovered in health, was well treated, but still protested against his confinement. Thus much likewise for the consistency of Benjamin Whiteley's complaint to the House of Commons, of ill treatment, during his imprisonment.

Believe me, Sir, in making this public declaration of the foregoing facts, I entertain no other motive, but to defend the cause of truth and innocence against the impudent and calumnious representations of Richard Lee, and Benjamin Whiteley, of Holmfirth.

But, as it is very notorious, neither of them possesses abilities adequate to the compositions in question, even *such as they are*, and to which their names are affixed; it behoveth those persons, whose peculiar province it is to watch over the preservation of the public peace, to ascertain who the author or authors may be of the aforesaid publications, as they appeared in the Leeds Mercury. This would be a great point gained towards the development of so foul a conspiracy.—You have full liberty to attach my name to the foregoing exposition of facts.

I am, Sir, your very huimble servant,  
WILLIAM KEELING,  
*Curtate of Holmfirth*  
Holmfirth, April 23, 1818

Leeds Mercury - Saturday 09 May 1818


To the EDITOR of the LEEDS MERCURY.

Holmfirth, April 29th, 1818.

SIR— I again trouble you to insert in your paper, the under-written remarks upon a letter of Mr. Keeling's, the Curate of this place, inserted in the Intelligencer of the 27th inst. in which I think it will appear pretty plainly, that his was the information upon oath, about which the Editor of that Paper swaggered so much, in his way, last week, and to which publication his evil genius has prompted him.

An imperious sense of public duty, Mr. Keeling says, has forced him to declare, and which he is ready to do upon oath when called on, that my wife sold Hone's Parodies, and that he refused to write to my Lord Sidmouth in my favour at her request; but he forgets to tell, that he had paid great attention to my wife in my absence previous to her application, and had repeatedly promised her that he would serve her in any thing in his power, and that without being requested.

He makes great professions of regret and repugnance to his feelings; yet it is too well known, that he is the busiest mortal alive, in sowing discord and strife, and spreading false alarms, which he introduces even into his pulpit, inveighing against imaginary enemies to the government, (*revolutioners*, as he learnedly calls them,) by which he excites the risibility of his gay, and the indignation of his graver hearers, when he chances to have any.

He gives us a curious account of his courage, at a time when he trembled with alarm, or pretended to do so. He sends his wife to the door at nine o'clock at night, upon a strange rap, who finds an Informer with a Parody, the seller of which, next day, he finds to be Richard Lee, and this is the crime he accuses me of, and about which he is ready to swear; and is, I suppose, the cause of his refusing to interfere directly or indirectly.—Would to God he had done so. I believe the injuries done to the laws of my country in my person, and to me and my family, would not then have taken place. As to the crime he lays to my charge, does he not know, that by the verdict of three London Juries, not one of whom was a Reformer, the Parodies are lawful.

He accuses me of ingratitude to my benefactors; he should have written it *male* instead of *bene*, and have accused me of too much lenity and forbearance. If confinement in a *Gentleman's Room*, chains, murderers, and thieves, for companions and bed-fellows, two pennyworth of bread per day, and six-pence per week to buy potatoes, were benefactions, I have yet to learn what insult, cruelty, and injustice is, and what sort of gratitude they excite; to say nothing of the unmanly and brutish treatment I received prior to my coming there, all of which, and abundance more of the like, I only hinted at in my petition.

He affects to feel much for Mr. Staveley, and to be his friend, yet his friend the Intelligencer, frantic with rage, blames me for excusing him upon the supposition that he acted to orders, and will have it that he had not time to receive orders, and therefore it must be his own act and deed; is he so blind and stupid as not to see that the vile subterfuge is only a means to expose the badness of his cause.—An order to use me ill, would be a sufficient stimulus to every act to those who too well know their cue; but for my not blaming Mr. Staveley, and my *mawkish cant*, would any one blame a dog, slighted by his master, for biting him, or would he not blame his master for urging him to it, especially if he knew that the same dog would fawn upon him and lick his hand without the stimulus.— Now the Printer and Curate are such dogs, but they are silly dogs, who turn and bite their masters. I think Mr. Staveley will not thank either of them for their labour, nor think himself ungrateful in withholding his thanks.

Messrs. Wright and Keeling believe there is a *dangerous faction* in existence, because, say they, it is well known the productions to which my name is annexed, are not my own; and the latter asserts, that if the real authors were ascertained, it would be a great point towards discovering so foul a conspiracy; and what then? then I should not wonder to see the "excellent Curate" running to and fro in order to get a declaration to Parliament, to suspend the Habeas Corpus again; or to obtain some act or other, making it Treason for innocence to vindicate itself, especially should it be found that there is some kind-hearted friend who acts as an amanuensis. It would be of small consequence if these dreamers of dreams were quiet, and did not attempt to frighten other people too, with the grim chimeras of their jaundiced imaginations, with which themselves are so horribly afraid.—But the whole squad of would-be-Tyrants, are chagrined because they see, and their neighbours see with them, that, through their late pretended plotting, they have become dupes to their own malignity, and the persecuted have lived to see the balances turn in their own favour.

To conclude, Mr. Keeling's mawkish cant, (to borrow the Printer's elegant phrase,) which has become familiar to him, since he exchanged the warehouse for the pulpit, but ill suits with his practice, whilst I challenge him to shew one unlawful act chargeable to me, I will say, I wish it could be said so of him.

I am Sir, your obedient Servant,  
RICHARD LEE.
