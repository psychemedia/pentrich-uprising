# Pentrich Rising

I was originally brought to the tale of the Pentrich uprising by way of a song, from folk punk band *Ferocious Dog*...

__Pentrich Rising, Ferocious Dog__

Oh my name is William Turner and my tale I'll tell to thee  
about the revolution in 1817  
With Brandreth and Ludlam and a band of fifty strong  
With hundreds more to meet us  
on the road, as we march on

A night for revolution, a night to fight  
A call to arms in England  
All workers must unite  
Tonight we march on Pentrich  
with London in our sights  
A night for revolution  
All workers must unite  
And then we fight

Little did we know there was a traitorous government spy  
William J. Oliver a man I now despise  
The Pentrich revolution was always doomed to fail  
For high treason, I was sentenced and hung in Derby Gaol

A night for revolution a night to fight  
A call to arms in England  
All workers must unite  
Tonight we march on Pentrich  
with London in our sights  
A night for revolution  
All workers must unite  
And then we fight

In researching the tale, it also led me to the Folly Hall uprising, in Huddersfield, which was also new to me. As the events were connected, it seemed to make sense to make a single, short tale that combined them, and this was the result...

*I bring you a tale,*  
*Of treason, and lies.*  
*Gather round for my story / I bring you a story,*  
*Of rebels, and spies.*

It's December, 1816, and revolt is in the air. The impoverished masses are clamouring for state aid, and Parliamentary Reform. A large rally is held, in London; peaceful, for the most part; but then, a riot: warrants are issued against the leaders of the supposed insurrection, and then rewards; arrests are later made. The date for the State Trial is set, for High Treason no less, for June.

The date of the trial approaches.

Around the country: secret gatherings; meetings, and mutterings. Parliamentary reform; state aid; the people are suffering, and want representation; the people are suffering, and need help.

From the Midland counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to the West Riding of Yorkshire, a tall, fair-headed, red-whiskered man, well-dressed, attends many of the meetings. He brings news: of sentiment in London; of the planned actions elsewhere around the country. His name? Mr William Oliver. His conversations with two local committees in particular, are notable: one in Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire; the other in Pentrich, near Nottingham.

The story told in each case is the same: as the State Trial begins in London for the men accused of leading the riot there in December, there will be: an insurrection; there will be: a march, to the metroplis; and there will be: change.

Weapons will be required: in part, from the garrisons, quickly captured, and rendered ineffective. No blood will be spilled. Debts will be relieved; industries will be nationalised; and Parliament will be reformed. The date is set: Sunday, June the 8th, 1817.

In Huddersfield, at the appointed time, on the appointed date, two dozen men meet at Folly Hall Bridge. Follow the river Holme out of town for three miles or so, out to Honley, and you'll find more armed men there, armed, and ready to march.

Meanwhile, sixty miles to the south, in Nottinghamshire, fifty men have set out from Pentrich, intending to take part in a co-ordinated raid on the nearby Butterley Iron Works; intending to steal arms, and munitions; and then, to make their way to Nottingham; and from there, to London, building numbers all the while.

But somehow, somehow, it seems that the Magistrates and the Yeomanry know exactly what is afoot. Somehow, somehow, it seems that they know exactly where the insurrectionists will meet.

It seems almost as if they had been forewarned.

And so it was: in Huddersfield, in the early hours of that Monday morning, June 9th, 1817, as the Yeomanry came on that small band of rebels, a shot was fired: a horse was hit. The ball of shot was removed, and the horse recovered. Several of the insurrectionists were also lucky, dispersed by the soldiers, and made their escape; but others were not so: they were apprehended, imprisoned, and taken to await their fate.

Down in Pentrich, as the men left the ironworks and headed towards Nottingham, their numbers grew: to 500 or more. But the authorities had been playing a waiting game; now, they had the evidence they needed. The rebels were dispersed; but their leaders, oh yes, their leaders, they were identified by who knows what intelligence, and after a short period on the run, they were caught and arrested.

Over the coming days, and weeks, the Huddersfield men were charged to appear at the Assizes in York. You didn't need much of a memory to recall the Special Commission held there at New Year, not five years earlier, when 15 men, Luddites from the Huddersfield area, were sentenced to death. Fifteen men, sentenced to death and promptly hanged.

The Folly Hall men might have feared a similar fate; but then, and in no small part thanks to the efforts of the editor of a local newspaper, Edward Baines of the Leeds Mercury, a story has broken: a Government spy has been found to be reporting to a Secret Parliamentary Committee; and not just to them, but also to certain local magistrates. And more than that, it seems he has been claiming to be a Parliamentary reformer, a rather well-connected Parliamentary reformer, with contacts in London and committees right across the country. A delegate who has been working closely with the organising committees of the North. Who has been promoting insurrection for the sole purpose of then "discovering" it. A certain man named William J. Oliver. Questions are asked in Parliament. Entrapment is claimed. There is public uproar — this is public service investigate journalism at its best. And the men at York are acquitted.

Meanwhile, in the State Trials in London, the trials of the claimed organisers of the London riot six months, the leaders there were also acquitted.

So has the State lost its ability to prosecute troublemakers and rebels? Are the courts now on the side of the people?

In Nottingham, the Pentrich rebels are charged to appear before a Special Commission. It will be held in the Autumn; the charges will be: of High Treason. Four men, in particular, are accused of being the leaders. Or perhaps, make that three. Because one of them, a man who had avoided action on the night in question, a man who had been in conversation with a certain Mr William Oliver over the previous few days and weeks, was treated differently. It would not do for *his* evidence to come before the jurors, let alone the public.

The trial began. Then, just as in sensitive cases now, controls were placed on the reporting of the trial by the press. But also then, as now, demonstrators had something to say: outside the court, graffiti'd messages to the jurors were daubed on the courthouse wall: "Jurymen – remember Oliver!" A reminder, to the jury, of their right to acquit.

The trial progressed, and the press leaked the details. But the verdict, was perhaps, a foregone conclusion: the three leaders from Pentrich, and sundry others, were found guilty of High Treason. For the others, a sentence of hanging. But for the leaders, a special punishment: a sentence of hanging; and then the severing of their heads from their necks; and then the quartering of their bodies. This was 1817, remember. Just over two hundred years ago.

Appeals were made for clemency; in a 19th century style plea bargain, the men sentenced to the simple hanging would instead be deported. For the men with the more creative sentences, for Jeremiah Brandreth, William Turner & Isaac Ludlam, the Prince Regent also showed some leniency: they would not suffer the indignity of being publicly quartered. But the rest of their sentences would stand.

And so it was, at just after midday, on Friday November 7th, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventeen, just over two hundred years ago from now, the three prisoners were paraded around the prison yard in Derby. They were led on to the platform, then hung from the scaffold using the short drop method: rather than the long drop, which would kill a man by snapping his neck, the low drop was more of a lowering, to ensure a long, slow, lingering death by strangulation. A lesson to the common man, who dared to challenge authority. And a good mornings's entertainment for the rest. Or not, as the case may be. For half an hour the men hung there, before their bodies were cut down, one at a time, and placed upon a block. For the executioner's task was not yet complete. For each body in turn was decapitated with an axe. In turn, their heads were lifted up by the executioner and shown to the stunned, silent crowd: "Behold the head of the traitor, Isaac Ludlum". "Behold the head of the traitor, William Turner". "Behold the head of the traitor, Jeremiah Brandreth". 

And as the stunned and silent crowd dispersed, the three bodies were taken away and dumped in an unmarked grave.

But of a certain well-dressed and apparently well-connected man, a man with fair hair and red whiskers - of a certain Mr. William J. Oliver - there was no sign.

And that is the end of the story of the Pentrich Uprising.

This is a tale I'd like to tell *much* more... Becuase at each telling, it gains a bit more life... and also becuase it's a story that needs to be told...
