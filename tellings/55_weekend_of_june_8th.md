The *Leeds Mercury* of Saturday, states the detection of a Conspiracy in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the arrest of ten persons near Dewsbury, charged with treasonable practices, as will be seen by the following letter:

"Leeds, Saturday, June 7.  
"Rumours of threatened Insurrection have been circulated in this place, with great confidence, for some days past, and these reports rest on the authority of persons in official situations. The story, as it has reached us, is, that delegates have of late held secret meetings, in various parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, as well as in other parts of the kingdom, at which a general rising of the People has been determined upon for the purpose of overturning the Government, and Sunday or Monday next is mentioned as the appointed time for the breaking out of the Rebellion. The report adds, that the Magistrates are to be seized as hostages and that one of Insurgents objects of the Insurgents is to liberate the State Prisoners.

"Since writing the above paragraph, we have received information on which we can rely, stating, that by the exertions of General Byng, ten persons, supposed to be delegates, were yesterday apprehended at Thornhill Lees, near Dewsbury, on suspicion of being concerned in treasonable and seditious practices. On the apprehension of she prisoners they were sent off to Wakefield in carriages, escorted by a detachment of cavalry; and so strong was the sensation produced in that place that many hundred of persons surrounded the Court house, and pressed for admission. The examination took place before Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and other Magistrates, and terminated in the committal of the prisoners for further examination. In the mean time a dispatch has been sent by the Magistrates to the Secretary of State for the Home Department."

The information relating to the time of meeting, anti the objects contemplated by the Delegates, was, we understand, furnished to the Civil and Military Authorities by one of their own number; and, upon the same authority, it was stated that 50 stand of arms would be found concealed in a barn near the place of meeting. To ascertain the veracity of this assertion, a person was dispatched to the place pointed out by the informer, but the sittings of the Magistrates, which were continued till between eight and nine o'clock last night, having broken up before the messenger's return, we are unable to give his report.

[In the report of the STATE TRIALS]

...

If any thing could add to the interest felt in the State Trials, it must be the rumour: for as yet we do not wish to state it as more than a rumour, of the arrest of ten delegates at Thornbury-hill *(sic)*, near Dewsbury, charged with treasonable practices. In a subsequent column will be found an article extracted from the *Leeds Mercury* of Saturday, which we presume is at least so far correct, as relates to the arrest of the individuals alluded to, and the nature or the crime with which they are charged. It is a different question, whether their plots were of so wide extent as is there suggested: and we cannot easily credit the notion that so wild a scheme as that of a general rising of the people for the purpose of overturning the Government, could, under the existing circumstances of the country have been contemplated. That there is the same turbulent and uneasy feeling in vast numbers of deluded people; that there are the same guilty hopes in many of their leaders, and the same rancorous feelings against all lawful authority, we can easily believe; but the links of the conspiracy have been already broken, a want of confidence must exist among the guilty parties themselves; and Government, at least so long as the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act continues, has the most effectual means of crushing in a moment every enterprise that may be formed against the public safety.

...

INTENDED INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE.

A plot for an insurrection has been fortunately discovered in Yorkshire. The object in view was nothing less than the overthrow of the Government. Delegates had held meetings in various parts of the West Riding, and it was determined that the rising of the people should take place yesterday or to day. The Magistrates were to have been seized as hostages, and the rescue of the State Prisoners was one of the objects of the insurgents. Such are the reports which have been circulated for some days past in Leeds. These have received confirmation from the arrest of several persons. The *Leeds Mercury* of Saturday gives the following information, which it states to be on good authority:—"That, by the exertions of General BYNG, ten persons, supposed to be delegates, were yesterday apprehended at Thornhill-Lees, near Dewsbury, on suspicion of being concerned in treasonable and seditious practices. On the apprehension of the prisoners they were sent off to Wakefield in carriages, escorted by a detachment of cavalry, and so strong was the sensation produced in that place, that many hundreds of persons surrounded the Court-House, and pressed for admission. The examination took place before Sir FRANCIS LINLEY Wood, Bart. BENJAMIN DEALTRY, Esq. and other Magistrates, and terminated in the committal of the prisoners for further examination. In the mean time a dispatch has been sent by the Magistrates to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

The same Paper adds, "The information, relating to the time of the Meeting, and the objects contemplated by the Delegates, was, we understand, furnished to the civil and military authorities by one of their own number, and upon the same authority it was stated, that fifty stand of arms would be found concealed in a barn, near the place of meeting. To ascertain the veracity of this assertion a person was dispatched to the place pointed out by the informer, but the Sittings of the Magistrates, which were continued till between eight and nine o'clock last night, having broken up before the messenger's return, we are unable to give the report."

LEEDS, SATURDAY JUNE 7.

Rumours of threatened insurrection have been circulated in this place, with great confidence, for some days past, and these reports rest on the authority of persons in official situations. The story, as it has reached us, is that delegates have of late held secret meetings in various parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, as well as in other parts of the kingdom, at which a general rising of the people has heen determined upon for the purpose of overturning the Government, and Sunday or Monday next is mentioned as the appointed time for the breaking out of the rebellion. Thereport adds, that the Magistrates are to be seized as hostages, and that one of the objects of the insurgents is to liberate the State prisoners.

Since writing the paragraph, we received information on which we can rely, stating, that by the exertions of General Byng, 10 persons, supposed to he delegates, were yesterday apprehended at Thornhill-Lees, near Dewsbury, on suspicion of being concerned in treasonable and seditious practices. On the apprehension of the prisoners they were sent off to Wakefield in carriages, escorted by a detachment of cavalry: and so strong was the sensation produced in that place, that many hundreds of persons surrounded the Court-house, and pressed for admisssion. The examination took place before Sir Francis Lindley Weod, Bart., Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and other magistrates, and terminated in the committal of the prisoners for farther examination. In the mean time a dispatch has been sent by the Magistrates to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

The information relating to the time of the meeting and the objects contemplated by the delegates, was, we understand, furnished to the Civil and Military Authorities by one of their own number; and upon the same authority it was stated, that 50 stand of arms would be found concealed in a barn near the place of meeting. To ascertain the veracity of this assertion a person was dispatched to the place pointed out by the informer, but the sittings of the Magistrates, which were continued till between eight and nine o'clock last night, having broken up before the Messenger's return, we are unable to give his report.— *Leeds Mercury.*

FROM THE LEEDS INTELLIGENCER, Monday, JUNE 9

"We are not at liberiy, nor would it be prudent, to divulgw all the circumstances that have heen ascertained; but the most perfect information of the state and disposition of all the seditious in this district, is in the hands of the Magistrates: and woe to them who shall hazard another attempt to disturb it. The wretches who have just been frustrated, have held secret meetings (as they thought) in the character of delegates in various parts of this county, as well as other quarters of the kingdoms; and had determined, in the madness of their hearts, on hoisting the signal for a general rebellion. Fools that they are! They saw not that they were drawing down inevitable destruction upon none but themselves! Of their supposed number (for we shall not say more till they have been mt upon their trial) 6 have been apprehended at Sheffield, and ten others were taken on Friday last, while they were assembled together, in a public-house at Thornhill Lees, near Dewsbury. Amongst these are James Mann, cloth-dresser, the Chairman of your late Leeds Union Club, for obtaining Parliamentary Reform, according to the Constitution; Thomas Murray, of Leeds, linenweaver, and John Smaller, of Horbury. They and their seven companions were immediately escorted to Wakefield by a detachment of cavalry, where they were examined hefore Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and other Magistrates.— After re-committing the prisoners for a second examination, a dispatch was sent off to the Secretary of State; from whom, probably, instructions will be received as to their present disposal.

"In the mean time, the Magistrates and Sir John Byng, the General commanding the District, have adopted the most effectual precautions for the preservation of the peace. In every quarter of the District, prudent arrangements have been entered into, In Leeds, a number of Special Constables have been sworn in. Two troops of the 13th Light Dragoons have been marched in from York, as an addition to the military force previously stationed here; and an inecreased force can be had at the shortest notice. Patroles of horse and of vigilantly traverse the streets during the night. That fine corps, which has received sueb distinguished praise from Sir John Byng, for its spirit, appearance, and discipline, the Northern Regiment of West Riding Yeomanry, assembled yesterday afternoon at Harewood, and other places, and are ready to act in any direction.

"As the plot is discovered, its explosion is for the present, no doubt, subdued. But vigilance and activity are not the less indispensable. Those who are well affected will now of course be more and more strongly impressed with the necessity of enrolling themselves in Volunteer Corps—not for the defence of Government, which is far beyond the reach of any danger,—but for the protection of themselves and their families and homes—the preservation of local tranquillity,—and the salvation of the deluded men themselves, who would rush into excesses, the end of which could be nothing but their own wretchedness and destruction. We have every reason to believe, that the Magistrates could readily obtain in this town and neighbourhood, the services of a sufficient number of individuals to form a corps of Volunteer Infantry."

"*Monday Morning, one o'clock.*—We stop the press to state that the whole of the cavalry are just mustered by the sound of a bugle. All we can learn is that they are to march in the direetion of Wakefield immediately. We suspect that attempts are probably making to liberate the prisoners in that town. Excepting that stones have been thrown at some of the horse patrole, Leeds is yet perfectly tranquil."— *Leeds Intelligencer.*

PROJECTED INSURRECTION IN YORKSHIRE

In the second edition of our last publication, we stated some particulars, which had just reached us, of a rumoured insurrection in this district, and also the arrest of ten persons near Dewsbury, on a charge of treasonable practices. We shall now proceed to lay before our readers all the information which we have been able to collect upon the subject, and our researches have been conducted with great diligence, with perfect impartiality, and with the most anxious wish to come at the truth. We shall first shortly state what appears to have been the object and extent of the plot, and then detail those circumstances which either attended its development, or which have subsequently occurred. It appears, that almost immediately after the suppression of the Union Societies, established in different towns in this district for effecting a reform in Parliament, some of the most violent members associated together, in a private and clandestine manner. At these meetings it is supposed to have become a question for deliberation, whether a change in the representation might not be effected without the intervention of Parliament, and a project to effect this purpose appears to have been communicated to them by Mr. Oliver, who had been introduced to these Ultra Reformers by Mitchell, (a Delegate, now in custody,) as a person deserving their confidence, and not only disposed to communicate to them interesting information as to the state of the country; but able to afford them the most affectual assistance; thus recommended, he soon possessed himself of their unbound confidence. This person is said to have represented to these credulous men, that all the people in the metropolis were favourable to a complete change of Government, that every thing was organised, and that it was absolutely settled, that on the night preceding the trial of the state prisoners, (the night of the 8th June,) a general rising, would take place; that as a consequence of this movement, all the public offices were to be taken possession of, all the constituted authorities seized, and the state prisoners released; and that a plan had also been arranged for securing all the military, by which means a change in the government would be effected, without any effusion blood. It was further represented to them, that in order to carry out this bloodless revolution, it was absolutely necessary that the same plan should be simultaneously acted upon in all parts of the country;- that it was therefore necessary, that on the night agreed upon, namely on Sunday the 8th inst. all the military in every district of the kingdom should be secured in their quarters, their arms seized, and that the magistrates and other civil officers should be arrested and placed in a state of restraint, not merely that no opposition might be made to the designs of the insurgents, but that they might serve as hostages for the safety of such of their own party as might fall into the hands of government. This absurd and wicked project is said to have been entertained, and in some degree acted upon, by a number of individuals in different parts of this district; and a participation in this plot is alleged against the persons who were apprehended yesterday se'nnigh, at Thornill Lees, charged with having assembled there, for the purpose of carrying into immediate effect this daring and traitorous project. Our readers will probably infer, from this statement, that the person introduced by Mitchell to the Ultra Reformers, was, in truth, a spy, and that every step taken towards the execution of the project, had been communicated to persons in authority, as the plot appears to have been known by some of the Magistrates for several weeks past. On Friday morning last, several of the Delegates, together with the informer, met at a public house, in this town, and proceeded in the direction of Dewsbury, and from thence to Thornhill Lees, where they had no sooner arrived at the house of rendezvous than they were surrounded by a detachment of Yeomanry Cavalry, and taken into custody. The following is a correct list of the names and places of residence of the persons apprehended:

John Smaller, shoemaker, Horbury, near Wakefield.  
Thomas Murray, Flax-Weaver, Leeds.  
James Mann, Cloth-Dresser, Leeds.  
Thomas Wood, Clothier, Westgate Common, Wakefield.  
Michael Waller, a Publican, and formerly keeper of the Yew-Tree, Robert-Town.
Miles Illingworth, Carpenter, Manningham, near Bradford.  
Benjamin Whitley. Cloth-Dresser, Holmfirth.  
Edward Fletcher, Card-Maker, High-Town.  
Joseph Midgley, Clothier, Almondbury.  
Wm. Walker, Clothier, Thornhill, near Dewsbury.

The prisoners were immediately conveyed in carriages, escorted by the Yeomanry Cavalry, to Wakefield, and lodged in the Court-House, where they were examined for several hours by Sir Francis Lindley Wood, Bart. Benjamin Dealtry Esq., and other magistrates there assembled. The examination was private; some circumstances have, however, transpired, which we shall state. It was asserted by one of the witnesses examined, that in a barn at Whitley, near the place of meeting, there were deposited one hundred pikes, and 50 stand of fire arms; it was further stated by the same witness, that in the house of John Smaller, of Horbury, would be found a quantity of ball cartridges. Messengers were instantly dispatched to search both these places, and it is important to state, that, on removing the straw in the barn, not a single pike or fire arm could be discovered, and it was the opinion of the persons who searched the premises, that the straw had not been disturbed for a considerable time. That part of the evidence which related to the ball cartridges was also falsified, nothing of the kind having been found in the house of Smaller. We have introduced the result of these important searches in this place, though, in the order of the narrative, it ought to have been introduced somewhat later. The Court-House at Wakefield, was surrounded by an immense assemblage of persons during the whole of the examination. About eight o'clock the prisoners were remanded until Monday, to the House of Correction, for further examination. They were escorted by the cavalry, who were dismounted, the escort was attacked by the populace with stones, brick-bats, &c. thrown with great violence. The prisoners were, however, safely lodged tn the House of Correction.

On Saturday, the succeeding day, two troops of the 13th regiment of Light Dragoons arrived in this town, from York, and that day and Sunday passed over without the slightest indication of insubordination, though not without alarm; for about midnight on Sunday, the town was thrown into the greatest consternation by the bugle sounding for the Cavalry, who remained on duty at he Court-House all night, in consequence of some alarming reports which had reached the magistrates, (who were also at the Court-House,) of an intention to rescue the prisoners at Wakfield. An express was immediately sent there to call out the Yeomanry Cavalry, who instantly assembled and continued on duty all day. No attempts at release were made, and the day passed over at Wakefield in tranquillity. ... __FOLLY_HALL_ELEMENTS_EXTRACTED__ ...  We understand that an outrage of a similar nature, was committed the same night, at Ossett, a village near Dewsbury, where the house of a member of the Yeomanry Cavalry was beset by a number of persons who demanded his arms, and on his refusal to give them up, fired several shots into the house. 

__FOLLY_HALL_ELEMENTS_EXTRACTED__

The re-examination of the prisoners charged with High Treason, took place at the House of Correction, in Wakefield, on Monday, where the Magistrates were holding a special Session for enquiring into the state of that gaol. The number of gentlemen on the Commission who attended on this occasion was uncommonly great, among others, were Sir F. L. Wood, Bart. Rev. W. R. Hay, (Chairman of the Manchester Sessions,) Rev. Wm. Wood, Benjamin Dealtry, Esq. and Benj Haigh Allen, Esq., Wm. Prest, Esq. the Mayor of this borough, was also present. This examination was, in the strictest sense, private, as no person, except the Magistrates, was suffered to remain in the room during the discussion of this subject. The prisoners were merely examined *pro forma*; they were brought into the room separately, and informed that their further examination was deferred until the following Monday, until which time they were re-committed. No witnesses were examined affecting the prisoners, and the meeting might rather be termed a Committee of inquiry, than a meeting of Justices for the judicial examination of prisoners. It may be presumed from this unusually long adjournment of the examination, that no evidence has yet been given against the prisoners which can warrant their committal for High Treason, and it is reasonable the re-committal has been with the view of detaining them until instructions can be received from government as to their ultimate disposal. We understand that some important papers have been found in the House of James Mann, the Leeds Delegate. In using the term *delegate*, we do not mean to insinuate that these persons have been elected by any body of men whatever; there is no evidence of any such delegation, and the probability is, that they represent nobody but themselves. We think it right to make this remark, lest it should be supposed that they were delegated by the places where they appear to be resident, which would have given a very formidable aspect to this plot, and a degree of importance to which it is by no means entitled. The conspiracy appears to have been confined to a relatively small number of persons, and was of a nature which the laws of the country afforded ample means to suppress. It appears also to have been of a very recent date, and to have originated in the injudicious, and we will add, unconstitutional measures adopted by Ministers to seek the expression of the public feeling relative to a  Reform in Parliament. It must be further remembered, that the account we have given of the plot must be considered in the nature of an *ex-parte* statement, and must rest for its credibility, very considerably, on the reliance which can be placed on the witnesses, who do not come before the public in a light which entitle them to much credit, and whose evidence has been materially broken in upon, by circumstances stated in the above account. It must be further recollected, that all the persons apprehended are of the lowest class of society, illiterate, and ill-informed, and liable to be the dupes of designing men. The great mass of the people are, we are convinced, free from any knowledge or concurrence in the plot. In short, when the whole is dispassionately considered, there appears no ground for that excessive panic and alarm which the first announcement of the plot produced, much less does afford any legitimate ground for a renewed suspension of the Constitutional rights of the people.

We feel great satisfaction in having to state that the most perfect tranquillity has prevailed here during the whole of the past week, and that the alarm by which the announcement of so many plots had produced, has nearly subsided.
