# Rebellion and retribution

Huddersfield , 1812

## Part One - Yorkshire Luddites Arise


England, 1812. Britain is at war with France, and the authorities are fearful of secret societies and revolution.

The year begins, and with it the firing of Oatlands Mill, and the gig mills it contained, near Leeds, in the North of England, on January 9th.

In February, a group of textile workers meet in the Shears Inn in Liversedge, just to the north east of Huddersfield to make their plans. On February 22nd, the attacks begin...

"Enoch hath made them, Enoch shall break them", goes the Luddite chant, recalling Enoch and James Taylor of Marsden, manufacturers of modern machinery; Enoch is also the name given to a heavy hammer used to break the machines created by its namesake.

Also in February, the Frame Breaking Bill is introduced into Parliament. Lord Byron, making his maiden speech in the House of Lords on February 27th, speaks against it, but to no effect. The Bill is passed into law and makes frame breaking a capital offence.

The swearing of secret oaths is also a capital offence.

From late February, through to April, several small scale attacks were mounted around Huddersfield.

On March 15th, the Ides of March, at 8.30 or so in the evening, an attack is made on Vickerman's Mill on Taylor Hill. Francis Vickerman, member and sponsor of the Committee for Suppressing the Outrages", is no friend of the Luddites.

It's the 9th of April. A thursday. A gang of 300 men attack Joseph Foster's Mill at Horbury, east of Huddersfield on the road to Wakefield.

Three days later, on Saturday April 11th, a coin toss decides the target of the next attack: Rawfolds Mill in Liversedge. Dumb Steeple, near Kirklees priory in Mirfield, and an arrow's shot away from Robin Hood's grave, just a short walk from the Three Nuns pub today, was the meeting place for over a hundred aggrieved men, men armed with hammers, mauls, pistols and muskets.

George Mellor and William Thorpe, familiar names to this day.

At the mill, mill owner William Cartwright made his way to bed at twenty-five minutes past midnight. I say mill, but it was nevertheless a fortified location: five armed soldiers  and four other men were barracked there; spiked rollers and vitriol, which is to say, concentrated sulphuric acid, also added to the defences.

Fifteen minutes later, Cartwright heard his dog barking an alarm. One of the soldiers went to sound an alarm bell, but the bell rope broke.
