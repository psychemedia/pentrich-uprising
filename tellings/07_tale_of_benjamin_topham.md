Nottingham and Newark Mercury - Saturday 11 February 1832

On Thursday week, at Pentridge, of which place he was a native, Mr. Benjamin Topham, aged 67. He some years arm resided in Nottingham, where he was well known. His polities were liberal; yet at the Derbyshire, or Jerry Brandreth *revolution*, in June 1817 `sic`, all Topham's frames were broken. The disturbances broke out at Pentridge, where Topham was then living. He was an upright, industrious man, but he laid the breaking of his frames so much to heart, that he lost his energy of spirit, and almost sank under it.

[Frames also broken in December 1811, March 1812 and June 1816
