Leicester Chronicle - Saturday 10 January 1818

Benjamin Scholes, the publican at Wakefield, whose evidence before the Magisrates at that place, was instrumental in exposing the artifices of *Oliver* and causing a number of poor men who had been apprehended near Leeds to be set at liberty, passed through this town the beginning of the week, on his return home, after having been confined upwards of six months in Cambridge Castle, by order of Lord Sidmouth. We understand that the whole of the State Prisoners, committed since the suspension the Habeas Corpus Act, have been liberated from confinement upon their own recognizances, with the exception of the Messrs. Evans (father and son), and Benbow, who insist on being brought to trial, or discharged *unconditionally*. Mr. Knight, of Manchester, arrived in that place, on Friday last, from Reading Gaol.

Leeds Intelligencer - Monday 09 March 1818

In the House of Commons, on Thursday, there was another long debate, in which Lords Lascelles and Milton took part, respecting the proceedings of Ministers under the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, the employment and character of Oliver, and the allegations of the different persons who have been recently discharged from imprisonment.

Want of room to give even an intelligible abstract of the discussion, compels us merely to state, that the numerous fabrications and falsehoods of the party were again triumphantly refuted—that all the facts and reasoning on those subjects, which have appeared in this paper, during the past twelve months, were fully confirmed,—and that the characters and assertions of the *innocent gentlemen* who have been recently let loose again upon the Public, from Mitchell down to his friend Ben Scholes, of Wakefield, were placed in their proper colours before the House.

On Wednesday se'nnight, two persons, who we understand were a king's messenger and a Bow-street officer, arrived at Wakefield, and arrested Benjamin Scholes, by virtue of a warrant from the Secretary of State, and immediately took him away for London. They starched his house and examined his papers, but did not carry one away with them. This was all done with such secrecy, that the fact was not known beyond the circuit of his family till Friday noon. — *Wakefield Star*

*Charges of Treasonable Practices.*— On Thursday night, a man of the name of Scholes, was brought to London by a King's Messenger and a Bow-street officer, from Wakefield.

"TO OUR READERS.

Sir Francis Burdett having given notice, that he shall bring BEN SCHOLES's Petition before the House of Commons, after the recess, we think proper to defer our refutation of it till that period."
