<h1>The Blanketeers and the Seditious Meetings Bill<a class="headerlink" href="#the-blanketeers-and-the-seditious-meetings-bill" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The following is a version of the Blanketeers’ story told in the style of a traditional fairy tale, and based on the principle that the story is what’s left when the facts have been forgotten. I’m not sure whether it works, but I thought I’d give it a go…</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Once, there was a King; a <em>mad</em> King; the King was so infirm that his son, the Prince, ruled in his place; but the prince like to drink, and the prince was a profligate, and the prince was a philanderer. In short, the prince was a full time playboy. And so, the King’s Ministers ran the country instead.</p>
<p>For a long time, the kingdom had been fighting many wars, and even though the wars were over now, the people were still very poor. And their discontent lead to angry mobs and riots.</p>
<p>Although the country had laws, the Ministers were fearful of revolt, so they did all they could to make it easier to arrest people first, and ask questions later.</p>
<p>This did not go down well with common people in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Far away from the city where the King and Prince lived, along with all the Ministers, but still within the kingdom, was another city. To walk from one to the other could take a week or more to walk — this is once, remember, and not everyone had a horse — and that was if you were a good walker.</p>
<p>One day, the people in the second city heard that a great mass of barbarians from the wastelands of the North were on a long march to the capital to complain to the King — or the Prince, or the Ministers, or to anyone who would listen, about how downtrodden they were.</p>
<p>There wasn’t really any barbarian hoard, but it got the people thinking. Maybe they could petition the Prince about the taxes they had to pay, the poor wages they received, the dire poverty in which they lived. Maybe they could persuade him to stop the Ministers taking the law into their own hands (they knew the King was mad, so it was pointless going to see him). And maybe they could lobby him for a Parliament that represented the common people, “them that hasn’t”, rather than the Lords and Ladies and just “them that has”.</p>
<p>So they had a meeting, and some of the men stood on a cart and gave a rousing speech to the crowd. And they decided they would march to the city where the Prince lived, up to a week’s walk away, to petition him.</p>
<p>Now the people knew that the Ministers had no love for the poor people, and nor did the local Magistrates, dirty smelly rabble that they were — the people, that is, not the Magistrates: they probably smelled beautiful and probably had a bath at last once a month — and they knew that the soldiers would be set on them if they looked like a mob.</p>
<p>So they were clever; they would gathered together in small groups of ten people or so, with a separate copy of the petition for each group, or even each person, even if that meant each petition only had a few names on it, or even just one name on it, and they would march in small groups, because nobody could argue with that.</p>
<p>Because the journey was long one, they would each take a blanket, to keep them warm at night as they’d have to camp under the stars; the one with petitions would pin them to the blanket, as a badge, to show their intention; and everyone who wasn’t going on the march would raise what little money they could so the marchers could buy some small amount of food each day.</p>
<p>So one morning, the people began to gather; thousands of them; a thousand or so set off on the march, “their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders” as if they were soldiers, and leaving the rest to their speeches and fundraising.</p>
<p>As emotions started to get heated in the crowd, in came the army, and arrested the ringleaders.</p>
<p>And then they went after the marchers, who were expecting their leaders to catch up with them later that day with the money to support them.</p>
<p>(As it was, I’ve heard it tell that the purseman with a pretty penny in funds to pay for food and accommodation along the way got lost himself, and only returned when all the money had been spent!)</p>
<p>The soldiers came along on their horses, with swords and sabers and who knows what, and the marchers — well, a blanket didn’t work so well as armour, so it’s not hard to work out who came off worst.</p>
<p>Some of the marchers were split up and sent this way, others were sent that way, and several hundred found themselves in jail for the night.</p>
<p>The leaders of the march were given special treatment, imprisoned, and given a day in court. Their witnesses were made ready, and then: nothing; back to prison they went.</p>
<p>The Ministers reacted in style, pushing through a law that banned unapproved gatherings of more than fifty people</p>
<p>Several weeks later, a Special Jury was laid on. But when the time came to present the case before the Judge, on charges that included “begging”, because the marchers hadn’t actually done anything wrong — they had broken no law, and this was a land that was supposedly ruled by law — the lawyer for the prosecution just muttered something about it all being peaceful now, and there was no need to charge the men, so he wouldn’t offer any evidence against them.</p>
<p>And so they went free.</p>
<p>As to the march to petition the Prince, it is said that one man, and one man only, actually made it to the city where the Prince lived. Maybe he got lost and didn’t realise he was on his own. Who knows?</p>
<p>But what I do know is that this is a true story.</p>
<p>Once, was 1817, and the kingdom was Great Britain. The mad King was King George III, and the Prince was the playboy Price Regent, later George IV. The Ministers, well, they were Lord Liverpool’s Tory Government. And the marchers? They were men from Manchester — The Blanketeers — who set off to march to London in March, 1817, from their original gathering point in St Peter’s Field, the scene of the Peterloo massacre two years later. Following the march, the Seditious Meetings Act of 1817 was passed, that banned unapproved gatherings of more than 50 people that would deliberate on grievances against the Church or State, and could lead to a capital death sentence for the organisers.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So what’s “real” story, the hi<em>story</em> of the Blanketeers’ March in March, 1817?</p>
