-----

Once, there was a King. A mad King. A King so mad that everyone one agreed he wasn't really fit to be a King at all, or at least, not to rule as one. But he was still the King, and so they couldn't just *get rid of him*. But they could perhaps get someone else to rule in his place. Like his son, perhaps, the Prince: the Prince Regent.

Now if the King was *mad*, you could equally say the that Prince was *bad*. And from quite an early age too. He'd started as a playboy, and became an adulterer; over-sexed and over-lubriccted; he could spend money faster than any Parliament could grant it to him; and he knew how to party. You might even say that was all he knew how to do.

And the Government? What sort of Government were they? The Orders in Council they called them, hadn't they, those stupid rules that had pretty much put an end to all the export trade. Was there anyone they weren't blockading by now?

That blasted foreign war had been going on for years, and now things were hitting hard at home too. For sure, the war might have been a Good Thing at the start: lots of soldiers meant lots of uniforms — lots of cloth that needed making — and the export trade had seemed to take as much as anyone could make, and at a fair price too. But when the blockades began, and the exports stopped? Well, it had been downhill ever since.

It was Monday night at the Sign of the Black-Bull, the Black-Bull in Mirfield, and several of the regulars were sat in the back room, drinking, one too many, and then some more, arguing over the news in Saturday's paper. Some good news, at least: it seemed the Orders in Council might be put an end to; but those London folk didn't know what they were talking about, with their "no evidence of distress in the West Riding of Yorkshire". Half the families round about in need of charity? Half of them?

And then talk turned to the fire at the Gibraltar Woollen Mill the Sunday before.

"Says here it weren't the Ludds that fired it; Baines reckons it were just a wool pile going up. But the whole building's done for, and all the machines. And good riddance to 'em", and they all said cheers to that.

"S'what we should'a done at Rawfolds" said one of them. "Torched it."

And so his tale began. "I were there, that night. At Rawfold's Mill. And I saw us men fell, too."

And the three passing travellers who were sat round in the bar on the other side of the thin wood partition that separated the back room from the bar, its small glass window partially broken, they heard him say that too.

"Bollocks, you were there..."

"And what would you know about it..."

We met at Dumb Steeple. It were pretty much a pitch black night, so we needed somewhere we could find.

TO DO - account of attack on Rawfold's Mill

"Yeah, an' I read all that in the paper too. Yer never were there..."

"And I was too... I were there, that night. At Rawfold's Mill. And I saw us men fell, too.  And I were never engaged in any association in my life `cept that of General Ludd. Ever true to it. For three years and more." And he raised a toast to himself, and supped again.

"hold thy peace, if there be a good trade and meal come down, Ned Ludd will die."-(A laugh.)

But for the three travelling men on the other side of the thin wood partition that separated the back room from the bar, its small glass window partially broken, they heard him say that too. And that was too much for them. One of them left the bar to find a Constable. Another went into the back room: "who was saying that, about Rawfolds?" and one of the drinkers pointed him out. "'s 'im. Pissed as a fart."

With no Constables to be had, the three travellers became investigators, took the man into another room and asked him to repeat what he'd said. "What yer on about? I said nothing."

And when they challenged him again: "get away wi yer. If yer've got a problem wi' me, take it up wi Cartwright. He'll vouch for me."

The next day, in Dewsbury, a troop of the Queen's Bays, arrested a man by the name of James Oldroyd, a man who had been out drinking in Mirfield, at the sign of the Black Bull, the evening before, on suspicion of having been concerned in the attack on Mr. Cartwright's Mill at Rawfolds. He was examined by Joseph Radcliffe, Esq., then committed to York-Castle to take his trial at the next Assizes.

A couple of week's later, there was another breakthrough for the forces of law and order. A corporal in one of the local militias had confessed not just to taking part in the attack on Rawfold's Mill, but also having been involved with the murder of William Cartwright. That was where it had arguably all started to go wrong for the Yorkshire Luddites.

Let me tell you about it.

TO DO - murder of WIlliam Horsfall


But now this Barrowclough chap from Holmfirth, this corporal in the local Miltia, had admitted to playing a part in Cartwirght's murder. He was taken across the Pennines to Manchester, safe from interference, and examined. Under questioning, he revealed the location of two depots of arms, one near Holmfirth, the other near Grange Moor. Three hundred or so Scotch Greys were dispatched from Manchester, and all the force in Huddersfield, civil and military, ordered to co operate with them in seizing the concealed arms; the whole night was spent in a fruitless search. They'd found nothing. Further questioning of Barrowclough took place. Further investigation. Further investigation that revealed that Barrowclough had been at York, with his regiment, at the time of Horsfall's murder. It wasn't just the King who suffered from mental infirmit, the presamable cause of the singular infatuation he had for accusing himself of crimes which was not, and could not, be guilty.

But there was still James Oldroyd, the Monday night drinker who'd admitted his part in the attack on Cartwright's Rawfolds Mill under the sign of the Black Bull at Mirfield, and whose trial was now due.
