# Ventnor Fringe / vfringe AnyWhens set

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Bijou Tent. If you're not here for the *Protest Days, Rebellion Nights* show, then you're in the wrong place...

All good..?

There is just one notice... If you do happen to have any infernal devices on your person, please make sure they're turned to off or silent. Or leave them outside. If they do interrupt the show, we reserve the right to treat them as the Luddites would, and smash them to smithereens.

And don't think we won't.

You have been warned.

So with that, please make yourselves comfortable, sit back, relax — if you can.. you did turn off your phone, right? — enjoy the show, __AND WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE...__

[WEAVING SONG]

I'M A WEAVER, A MASTER WEAVER  
I'VE GOT A LOOM WHERE THE BEST CLOTH'S MADE.  
PLAIN CLOTH, TWILL, BROCADE AND SATIN  
I'M THE MASTER OF MY TRADE

SHED THE WARP AND FLY THE SHUTTLE  
LEAD THE REED THE WEFT IS LAID.

I CAN WIND A FLYING BOBBIN  
I CAN WARP A THEME OF THREAD  
I CAN WEAVE A SHEET OF LINEN  
FIT TO GRAZE A ROYAL BED  
LIFT THE HEEL AND FLY THE SHUTTLE  
SWING THE REED THE WEFT IS LAID.

HEAR THE DIN OF THE LOOM THE SHUTTLE  
WEAVING IS A NOISY TRADE  
SEE HOW EVEN, SOFT AND GENTLE  
LIES THE CLOTH WHEN IT IS MADE  
LIES THE CLOTH WHEN IT IS MADE.

I'M A WEAVER, A MASTER WEAVER  
I'VE GOT A LOOM WHERE THE BEST CLOTH'S MADE  
PLAIN CLOTH, TWILL, BROCADE AND SATIN  
I'M THE MASTER OF MY TRADE.

A jaunty little song, that sets the scene: of a more pastoral time: of sheep on the hillside, and three acres and a cow; of cottage industries rather towns; framework knitters and handloom weavers; of a way of life that hadn't changed, quite literally, for centuries.

But then, things did change, and the tales we will tell you today, were born directly of those changes.

*NED LUDD'S TALE*

It is said that towards the end of the 18th century, a certain young apprentice named Edwards Ludlam, or "Ned" to his friends, had been caughtly idling at his knitting by his master. A visit to the magistarate followed — the master was tied of his young apprentice repeatedly slacking off — and a sentence was passed: a whipping at the pillory post.

Not surprisingly, young Ned Ludlam felt more than a little aggrieved; so on returning to his knitting frame, he picked up and hammer, and did his worst: "so how am I supposed to work now?" he said, looking at the splintered remains of the knitting machine.

*BENJAMIN TOPHAM'S TALE*

Fast forward to the year 1811. November time, and still in Nottinghamshire. Some of the men who had recently started calling themselves Luddites, followers of a mythical General Ludd, were paying a visit to a certain Mr. Benjamin Topham.

These men are not like the idle, feckless lad with an attitude problem, a quick temper, and a dislike of hard work; although they've borrowed his name, calling themselves Luddites, or followers of General Ludd, they're skilled men; they've served their seven year's apprenticeship and they're resentful that the new masters are reducing the prices paid for the goods they produce, whilst at the same time putting up the rents of the narrow frames they use for their work. Theyr'e also upset with the master's employing colts - unapprenticed, unskilled workers — and setting them to work on the new wide frames, making poor quality cut-up stockings that are trashing the reputation of the quality goods they produce.

...

...

And there ends our first tale, of Nottinghamshire Luddites and their dealings with the hosier Benjamin Topham.

__CROPPER MUSIC INTRO__

Fifty miles to the north, in John Wood's cropping shop on the outskirts of Huddersfield, the twenty-two year old cropper, George Mellor, and several of his similarly aged workmates, are listening to the young John Booth, an apprentice harness maker of just nineteen years of age, and son of a cropper turned clergyman, reading news from the Leeds Mercury of the recent outrages in Nottinghamshire.

The croppers were perhaps the best paid of the Yorkshore cloth workers, strong men, heavy drinkers, whose job was to raise the knap, with teasels, then cut the cloth smooth, with hefty cropping sheers they could weight thirty pounds — twenty kilos, 20 bags of sugar — or more.

But with the introduction of gig mills and mechanised shearing frames, they could see there whole way of life coming to an end.

__MONTY SITS DOWN__

[CROPPER LADS]

1  
COME, CROPPER LADS OF GREAT RENOWN,  
WHO LOVE TO DRINK GOOD ALE THAT’S BROWN,  
AND STRIKE EACH HAUGHTY TYRANT DOWN,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME,  
AND GALLANT LADS THEY’LL BE,  
WITH LUSTY STROKE THE SHEARFRAMES BROKE,  
THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME.

As with the Nottinghamshore Luddites, the first of the attacks would be made by small groups of men on the smaller finishing shops in the villages and valleys surrounding the wool town of Huddersfield, attacks carried out in darkness, to evade the soldiers brought in in an atttempt to keep the peace.

2  
WHAT THOUGH THE SPECIALS STILL ADVANCE,  
AND SOLDIERS NIGHTLY ROUND US PRANCE,  
THE CROPPER LADS STILL LEAD THE DANCE,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME,  
AND GALLANT LADS THEY’LL BE,  
WITH LUSTY STROKE THE SHEARFRAMES BROKE,  
THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME.

But the Yorkshire Luddites had also set their sights on the bigger mills, the larger water-powered and mechanised factories. And for that, they needed guns - and so as well smashing the machines, they tooks the guns that many a household would have had in those days, brought back, perhaps, from time spent in the army fighting Bonaparte's men.

3  
AND NIGHT BY NIGHT WHEN ALL IS STILL,  
AND THE MOON IS HID BEHIND THE HILL,  
WE FORWARD MARCH TO DO OUR WILL,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME,  
AND GALLANT LADS THEY’LL BE,  
WITH LUSTY STROKE THE SHEARFRAMES BROKE,  
THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME.

The first of the attacks on the larger mills saw 300 men or more from Huddersfield and Dewsbury attack Foster's mill in Horbury, a 10 mile or so hike each way in dead of night. All the frames would be broken, the mill itself torched. A great success for th Luddites.

For the second attack, a toss up between William Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds, and Horsfall's mill in Marsden.

They chose Cartwright's. This time, the Huddersfield men would meet at Dumb Steeple, not far from Hartshaead Moor services on the M62 today, then march on William Cartwright's water-powered Mill at Rawfolds.

4  
GREAT ENOCH HE SHALL LEAD THE VAN,  
STOP HIM WHO DARES, STOP HIM WHO CAN,  
PRESS FORWARD EVERY GALLANT MAN,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME,  
AND GALLANT LADS THEY’LL BE,  
WITH LUSTY STROKE THE SHEARFRAMES BROKE,  
THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME.

THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME,  
AND GALLANT LADS THEY’LL BE,  
WITH LUSTY STROKE THE SHEARFRAMES BROKE,  
THE CROPPER LADS FOR ME.

The men marched in formation.

...



[Samuel Hartley and John Booth]

They would attack the man, not the machine.

Drew lots. but the first attempt was unsuccessful... Court martial

Whipping.

But still George Mellor wanted to do more. And so his attention turned to William Horsfall, whose mill had been the one they hadn't attacked when they chose Cartwright's.

__Horsfall was, if nothing else, a man of habit.__

__[ JOHN THE WEAVER MUSIC STARTS ]__

Each Saturday, William Horsfall, mill owner, business man, would ride into Huddersfield to transact some business or other at the Cloth Hall, just where the Sainsbury's is now in the middle of town opposite Cloth Hall Street...

Each Saturday, William Horsfall,

On his way home, Horsfall would often stop for a drink at the pub at the bottom of the hill that led back up to his home.

Rather than actually get off his horse, he would lean down, and a drink would be passed back to him — rum and coke. Or maybe it was just a rum.

Now although he was no friend of the Luddites, he knew his business relied on his workers. So seeing a couple of his men there, at the pub, he did as he often would do, __and bought them a drink too...__

[JOHN THE WEAVER]

1  
JOHN WAS POOR, BUT HONEST, COTTON CLOTH WAS WHAT HE MADE  
TILL MACHINERY TOOK OVER, JOHN THE WEAVER LOST HIS TRADE.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE.  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

2  
THE LOOM WAS NOISY, WORK WAS HARD, AND ALL FOR MEAGRE PAY.  
AND THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN FOLK, THEY WORKED BOTH NIGHT AND DAY.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE,  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

3  
THE MASTER'S IN HIS MANSION CARVING SUNDAY ROAST SO FINE,  
WHILE POOR JOHN'S GOT ONE MUTTON CHOP TO FEED A WIFE AND NINE.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE,  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

Horsfall finished his drink, said farewell to his men, and started to ride up the hill, towards the plantation of trees at the top, stone walls on either side the like of which still line many a West Yorkshire road to this day, still soot stained black from a century of smoke, belched from the coal fired chimneys of the dark satanic mills that were yet to appear...

4  
SO JOHN HE PRAYED TO LUDD THE KING, WHO CAME WITH FIRE AND DOOM,  
HE WAS CARRYING GREAT ENOCH AND HE SMASHED THE POWER LOOM.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE,  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

A shot rings out; then another. From behind the wall on the other side of the road,  third, from the other side of the road. "Murder", calls out Horsfall, and starts to fall from his horse.

5  
THE MASTER DRIVES THE SOLDIERS, AND THE SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR,  
AND FOURTEEN MEN OF YORK-SHY-ER ARE HUNG FOR BEING POOR.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE,  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

IT'S THE SAME THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, IT'S A SHAME,  
IT'S A WRETCHED SHAME, THE RICH WHO GETS THE PLEASURE,  
AND THE POOR WHO GETS THE BLAME.

Pub, death.

No-one speaking. A couple of week's after Horsfall's assassination, assiassination of Prime Minister, Spencer Percival. A trial would be held within three days, a hanging three days after that.

Twisting in; oaths.

Prisnce Regent proclamation, a reward and a pardon for anyone giving up the miscreants, even if they had been involved. [Benjamin Walker] 

At the first trial, for murder, George Mellor, Thomas Smith and William Thorpe.


In all, seventeen men would be hung: Mellor, Thorpe and Smith for murder — after their hanging they would be anatomised and dissected, as was the custom — then fourteen more, in two batches of seven.

In each case, SILENCE.

Guards - to prevent any attempt at escape.

As the crowd stood silent, those at the front, near to the platform, could perhaps here Mellor's final words:

__SOME OF MY ENEMIES MAY BE HERE TODAY. IF THEY ARE, I FORGIVE THEM. JUST AS I HOPE THE WORLD WILL FORGIVE ME.__

[FAREWELL]

FAREWELL ME LADS, LOOK WHAT WE'VE COME TO,  
AT YORK CASTLE, THEY'RE BUILDING GALLOWS,
AT YORK CASTLE, THEY'RE BEATING THE DRUMS.

FAREWELL TO OUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,  
FAREWELL TO OUR LOVING WIVES,  
FOR IN A MOMENT OF MADNESS,  
WE GAVE UP OUR LIVES.

FAREWELL TO OUR LOVED ONES,  
FAREWELL ME LADS.

BEHOLD THE SAVIOUR OF MANKIND,  
NAILED TO A SHAMEFUL TREE,  
HOW VAST THE LOVE THAT INCLINED HIM,  
TO BLEED AND FOR ME.

SEVEN AND SEVEN, ON A COLD AND DREADFUL JANUARY DAY,
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH I WANTED TO DO
BUT THE FIRE IN MY HEART ALWAYS LED ME ASTRAY

FAREWELL TO OUR LOVED ONES, FAREWELL ME LADS,
FAREWELL TO OUR LOVED ONES, FAREWELL ME LADS.

*THE BLANKETEERS' TALE*

It wasn't just the Luddites, of course, who gave their name to protest movements. There are many other tales we might have told, other songs we might have sung; of protest movements from the centuries before, or the few short years and decades after: of the Diggers, and the Levellers, who fought against the loss of the commons, and the enclosure of land; of Kett's Rebellion, of 1549, and the Reformation Oak under which he held court; of the Pentrich Rebels, who in 1817 sought to march on London and overthrow government by popular revolt; or the Cato Street Conspirators of 1920, who had planned an armed attack, using cutlasses and guns, on the members of the Cabinet as they dined together. As men found guilty of High Treason, the Pentrich rebels and the Cato Street conspirators would all suffer the ultimate penalty, not just of hanging — but also beheading. This is just over two hundred years ago, remember... But those are all tales for another day. As are the stories of the Rebecca Rioters of the 1840s, or the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834, or the followers of Captain Swing in 1830.

Because for now, there is time for just one more tale. Of the Blanketeers.

It's 1817. Tensions are high. The Ludding times are over, the date set for the last of the Luddite trials, in April, for attacks on Heathcoat and Boden's mill in 1816, a trial at which 8 more men will be sentenced to hang.

The government is fearful of revolt. In scenes reminiscent, perhaps, of scenes today, a stone-throwing incident involving the Prince Regent in which the window of his carriage was broken is at first thought to be a "terrorist incident", an attempted assassination, or the precursor to revolution; it was nothing of the kind, although that didn't stop missives going out from London to the provinces telling magistrates to be alert and on their guard for insurrection. A bill starts to make its way through Parliament that will suspend the Habeas Corpus Act — the authorities will no longer need any evidence to justify arresting any one they are suspicious of, they can make the arrest first and then start to look for the evidence. And in Manchester, the people are hungry. Another poor harvest; taxes are high — the tariffs introduced by the Corn Laws protect prices for domestic producers, but it's the people who pay — representation of the people of Manchester is none existent in Parliament — despite being one of the most populous cities in England, Manchester had no MP — the threat of the Suspension Act is anathema to most — and the people... congregate.

...

Several years later, St Peter's Field was in the news again: as the site of the Peterloo Massacre where EIGHTEEN people died and hundreds were injured.

And a few years after that, the workers of Manchester were marching again, protesting against low wages, high prices, and FOOD POVERTY, heading out from Manchester, and over the Pennines into Yorkshire, pulling the plugs out of the large boilers that generated the steam the powered the factory looms, and in so doing, destroying the furnaces __AND PUTTING A STOP TO THE WORK OF THE MILLS.__

[PLUG DRAWERS SONG]

FOR A HANDFUL OF PENNIES WE SWEAT AND WE'RE SLAVES,  
SO THE RICH HAVE FINE HOUSES AND THE POOR CAN HAVE GRAVES,  
YOU SPINNERS, YOU WEAVERS, YOUR CLOTH YOU CAN'T KEEP,  
THE FACTORY WANTS CHILDREN, LABOUR IS CHEAP.

AND THE MILL WHEEL IT TURNS, AND THE BOSSES ARE PROUD,  
AND THE PROFITS ARE HIGH, AND THE LOOMING IS LOUD,  
WE DON'T NEED GOODWILL, WE HAVE MONEY INSTEAD,  
FOR THE FACTORY IS KING, AND THE HAND OF IT'S DEAD.

SO DRAW THE PLUGS, DAM THE RILL,  
WE'LL KEEP ON MARCHING,  
TILL WE'VE CLOSED YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN,  
WE'RE MARCHING THROUGH THE TOWN,  
HEPTONSTALL, HARDCASTLE, HEBDEN AND HALIFAX,  
WE'LL CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

MY COAT IS WORN THIN, THE WINTER WINDS BLOW,  
IN THE MORNING WE HURRY TO THE VALLEY BELOW,  
OUR CLOGS ON THE COBBLES, THEY SLIP AND THEY SPARK,  
THE MILL WINDOWS SHINE, BUT THE SKY IS STILL DARK

AND I'M TIRED AND I'M HUNGRY, SOMETIMES I WEEP,  
BUT THEY DOCK YOU A FARTHING, FOR FALLING ASLEEP,  
LAST MONTH MARY GREENWOOD, WAS NODDING HER HEAD,  
NOW THERE'S BLOOD ON THE FLOOR, AND MARY LIES DEAD

SO DRAW THE PLUGS, DAM THE RILL,  
WE'LL KEEP ON MARCHING,  
TILL WE'VE CLOSED YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN,  
WE'RE MARCHING THROUGH THE TOWN,  
HEPTONSTALL, HARDCASTLE, HEBDEN AND HALIFAX,  
WE'LL CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

THEY SIT IN THEIR HOUSES AND PREACH TO THE POOR.  
WHILE WE RISK OUR LIVES ON THE FACTORY FLOOR.  
WITH DUST IN OUR LUNGS AND OUR BODIES ARE BENT.  
THEY LOWER OUR WAGES WHILE RAISING OUR RENTS

SO THE PLUG DRAWER HAS MARCHED, AGAINST ALL THESE HILLS,  
BUT THE LAW'S ON THE SIDE, OF THE FACTORIES AND MILLS,  
WHILE POOR MARY GREENWOOD, LIES COLD IN HER GRAVE,  
A LIFE THAT WAS LOST, FOR THE MONEY THEY SAVED

SO DRAW THE PLUGS, DAM THE RILL,  
WE'LL KEEP ON MARCHING,  
TILL WE'VE CLOSED YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN,  
WE'RE MARCHING THROUGH THE TOWN,  
HEPTONSTALL, HARDCASTLE, HEBDEN AND HALIFAX,  
WE'LL CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

SO DRAW THE PLUGS, DAM THE RILL,  
WE'LL KEEP ON MARCHING,  
TILL WE'VE CLOSED YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN,  
WE'RE MARCHING THROUGH THE TOWN,  
HEPTONSTALL, HARDCASTLE, HEBDEN AND HALIFAX,  
WE'LL CLOSE YOUR BLOODY MILL,  
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
