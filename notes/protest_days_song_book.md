\textbf{WEAVING SONG.}\\
\textit{(Bagpuss) — words Oliver Postgate, music "The Calton Weaver" (trad).}

\begin{verse}
I'm a weaver, a master weaver,\\
I've got a loom where the best cloth's made.\\
Plain cloth, twill, brocade or satin,\\
I'm the master of my trade.\\
Shed the warp and swing the shuttle,\\
Beat the reed, the weft is laid.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I can wind a flying bobbin,\\
I can warp a theme of thread.\\
I can weave a sheet of linen,\\
Fit to grace a royal bed.\\
Lift the heel and fly the shuttle,\\
Swing the reed, the weft is laid.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Hear the din of loom and shuttle,\\
Weaving is a noisy trade.\\
See how even, soft and gentle,\\
Lies the cloth when it is made,\\
Lies the cloth when it is made.
\end{verse}

\textbf{CROPPER LADS}\\
\textit{Traditional.}

\begin{verse}
Come, cropper lads of great renown,\\
Who love to drink good ale that's brown,\\
And strike each haughty tyrant down,\\
With hatchet, pike and gun.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{The cropper lads for me,}\\
\textit{And gallant lads they'll be,}\\
\textit{Who with lusty stroke,}\\
\textit{The shearframes broke,}\\
\textit{The cropper lads for me.}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
What though the specials still advance,\\
And soldiers nightly round us prance,\\
The cropper lads still lead the dance,\\
With 'atchet, pike and gun.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\begin{verse}
And night by night when all is still,\\
And the moon is hid behind the hill,\\
We forward march to do our will,\\
With hatchet, pike and gun.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\begin{verse}
Great Enoch he shall lead the van,\\
Stop him who dares, stop him who can,\\
Press forward every gallant man,\\
With hatchet, pike and gun.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS] x 2}

\textbf{JOHN THE WEAVER}\\
\textit{Words and music: Glenn Koppany.}

\begin{verse}
John was poor, but honest,\\
Cotton cloth was what he made\\
Till machinery took over,\\
John the weaver lost his trade.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{It's the same the whole world over,}\\
\textit{It's a shame, it's a wretched shame,}\\
\textit{The rich who get the pleasure,}\\
\textit{And the poor who get the blame.}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
The loom was noisy, work was hard,\\
And all for meagre pay,\\
And the children and the women folk,\\
They worked both night and day.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\begin{verse}
The master's in his mansion\\
Carving sunday roast so fine,\\
While poor John's got one mutton chop\\
To feed a wife and nine.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\columnbreak

\begin{verse}
So John he prayed to Ludd the king,\\
Who came with fire and doom,\\
He was carrying Great Enoch\\
And he smashed the power loom.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\begin{verse}
The master drives the soldiers,\\
And the soldiers at the door,\\
And fourteen men of York-shy-er\\
Are hung for being poor.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS x 2]}

\textbf{FAREWELL ME LADS}\\
\textit{Words and music: Glenn Koppany.}

\begin{verse}
Farewell me lads, look what we've come to,\\
At York Castle, they're building gallows,\\
At York Castle, they're beating the drums.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Farewell to our beautiful children,\\
Farewell to our loving wives,\\
For in a moment of madness,\\
We gave up our lives.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Farewell to our loved ones,\\
Farewell me lads.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Behold the saviour of mankind,\\
Nailed to a shameful tree,\\
How vast the love that inclined him,\\
To bleed and for me.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Seven and seven, on a cold and dreadful january day,\\
And there was so much I wanted to do,\\
But the fire in my heart always led me astray.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Farewell to our loved ones, farewell me lads,\\
Farewell to our loved ones, farewell me lads.
\end{verse}

\textbf{PLUG DRAWERS SONG}\\
\textit{Words and music: Glenn Koppany.}

\begin{verse}
For a handful of pennies we sweat and we're slaves,\\
So the rich have fine houses and the poor can have graves,\\
You spinners, you weavers, your cloth you can't keep,\\
The factory wants children, labour is cheap.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And the mill wheel it turns, and the bosses are proud,\\
And the profits are high, and the looming is loud,\\
We don't need goodwill, we have money instead,\\
For the factory is king, and the hand of it's dead.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{So draw the plugs, dam the rill,}\\
\textit{We'll keep on marching, till}\\
\textit{We've closed your bloody mill,}\\
\textit{Down, down,}\\
\textit{We're marching through the town:}\\
\textit{Heptonstall, Hardcastle, Hebden and Halifax,}\\
\textit{We'll close your bloody mill,}\\
\textit{Down, down, down.}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
My coat is worn thin, the winter winds blow,\\
In the morning we hurry to the valley below,\\
Our clogs on the cobbles, they slip and they spark,\\
The mill windows shine, but the sky is still dark.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And I'm tired and I'm hungry, sometimes i weep,\\
But they dock you a farthing, for falling asleep,\\
Last month Mary Greenwood, was nodding her head,\\
Now there's blood on the floor, and Mary lies dead.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS]}

\begin{verse}
They sit in their houses and preach to the poor,\\
While we risk our lives on the factory floor.\\
With dust in our lungs and our bodies are bent,\\
They lower our wages while raising our rents.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So the plug drawer has marched, against all these hills,\\
But the law's on the side, of the factories and mills,\\
While poor Mary Greenwood, lies cold in her grave,\\
A life that was lost, for the money they saved.
\end{verse}

\textit{[CHORUS x 2]}

\textbf{THE FOUR LOOM WEAVER}\\
\textit{Traditional; Roud 937.}

\begin{verse}
I'm a four loom weaver, as many a man knows.\\
I've nowt to eat and I've worn out m' clothes.\\
M' clogs are all broken, and stockings I've none.\\
Thee'd hardly gi's tuppence for all I've gotten on.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Old Billy O' Bent, he were telling us long\\
We mayn't had better times if I'd nobbut held m' tongue.\\
Well, I held m' tongue til I near lost m' breath,\\
And I feel in m' heart that I'll soon clem to death.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm a four loom weaver, as many a man knows.\\
I've nowt to eat and I've worn out m' clothes.\\
Old Billy were right, but he ne'er were clemmed,\\
He ne'er picked o'er in his life.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
We held out for six weeks, thought each day were the last.\\
We tarried and shifted til we were quite fast.\\
We lived upon nettles while nettles were good.\\
And Waterloo Porridge were best to us (as) food.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Our Margaret declares, if hoo'd clothes to put on,\\
Hoo'd go up t' London and see the great man.\\
And if things didn' alter when there hoo'd been\\
Hoo' swears hoo'd fight til there blood upto th' e'en.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm a four loom weaver as many a man knows.\\
I've nowt to eat and I've worn out m' clothes.\\
Stockings I've none, nor looms to weave on,\\
I've woven m'sen to far end.
\end{verse}
