# Protest Days, Rebellion Nights (Cues)

... enjoy the show, __AND WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE...__

[WEAVING SONG]

*NED LUDD'S TALE*

*BENJAMIN TOPHAM'S TALE*

*AND THAT IS THE END OF THE TALE*

*[AP]P[L]AUSE*

__CROPPER MUSIC INTRO__

Fifty miles to the north, ...

*... describe croppers...*

__MONTY SITS DOWN__

[CROPPER LADS — TALE BETWEEN EACH VERSE]

1  
COME, CROPPER LADS OF GREAT RENOWN,  
WHO LOVE TO DRINK GOOD ALE THAT'S BROWN,  
AND STRIKE EACH HAUGHTY TYRANT DOWN,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

&C.

*SMALL* As with the Nottinghamshore Luddites, the first of the attacks would be made by small groups of men on the smaller finishing shops in the villages and valleys surrounding the wool town of Huddersfield, attacks carried out in darkness, to evade the soldiers brought in in an atttempt to keep the peace.

2  
WHAT THOUGH THE SPECIALS STILL ADVANCE,  
AND SOLDIERS NIGHTLY ROUND US PRANCE,  
THE CROPPER LADS STILL LEAD THE DANCE,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

&C.

*GUNS* But the Yorkshire Luddites had also set their sights on the bigger mills, the larger water-powered and mechanised factories. And for that, they needed guns - and so as well smashing the machines, they tooks the guns that many a household would have had in those days, brought back, perhaps, from time spent in the army fighting Bonaparte's men.

3  
AND NIGHT BY NIGHT WHEN ALL IS STILL,  
AND THE MOON IS HID BEHIND THE HILL,  
WE FORWARD MARCH TO DO OUR WILL,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

&C.

*MILLS* The first of the attacks on the larger mills saw 300 men or more from Huddersfield and Dewsbury attack Foster's mill in Horbury, a 10 mile or so hike each way in dead of night. All the frames would be broken, the mill itself torched. A great success for th Luddites.

For the second attack, a toss up between William Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds, and Horsfall's mill in Marsden.

They chose Cartwright's. This time, the Huddersfield men would meet at Dumb Steeple, not far from Hartshead Moor services on the M62 today, then march on William Cartwright's water-powered Mill at Rawfolds.

4  
GREAT ENOCH HE SHALL LEAD THE VAN,  
STOP HIM WHO DARES, STOP HIM WHO CAN,  
PRESS FORWARD EVERY GALLANT MAN,  
WITH HATCHET, PIKE AND GUN.

&C. x 2

*ATTACK ON CARWRIGHT'S MILL* The men marched in formation.

...

[Samuel Hartley and John Booth]

*CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? SO CAN I*

CROPPERS SONG V3 REPRISE

*Both men would die that night... Funerals.*

*They would attack the man, not the machine.*

Drew lots. but the first attempt was unsuccessful... Court martial

Whipping.

But still George Mellor wanted to do more. And so his attention turned to William Horsfall, whose mill had been the one they hadn't attacked when they chose Cartwright's.

__Horsfall was, if nothing else, a man of habit.__

__[ JOHN THE WEAVER MUSIC STARTS ]__

Each Saturday, William Horsfall, mill owner, business man, would ride into Huddersfield to transact some business or other at the Cloth Hall, just where the Sainsbury's is now in the middle of town opposite Cloth Hall Street...

Each Saturday, William Horsfall,

On his way home, Horsfall would often stop for a drink at the pub at the bottom of the hill that led back up to his home.

Rather than actually get off his horse, he would lean down, and a drink would be passed back to him — rum and coke. Or maybe it was just a rum.

Now although he was no friend of the Luddites, he knew his business relied on his workers. So seeing a couple of his men there, at the pub, he did as he often would do, __and bought them a drink too...__

[JOHN THE WEAVER — THREE (3) VERSES]

1  
JOHN WAS POOR, BUT HONEST, COTTON CLOTH WAS WHAT HE MADE  
TILL MACHINERY TOOK OVER, JOHN THE WEAVER LOST HIS TRADE.

&C.

2  
THE LOOM WAS NOISY, WORK WAS HARD, AND ALL FOR MEAGRE PAY.  
AND THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN FOLK, THEY WORKED BOTH NIGHT AND DAY.

&C.

3  
THE MASTER'S IN HIS MANSION CARVING SUNDAY ROAST SO FINE,  
WHILE POOR JOHN'S GOT ONE MUTTON CHOP TO FEED A WIFE AND NINE.

&C.

*C U laterz, and up hill* Horsfall finished his drink, said farewell to his men, and started to ride up the hill, towards the plantation of trees at the top, stone walls on either side the like of which still line many a West Yorkshire road to this day, still soot stained black from a century of smoke, belched from the coal fired chimneys of the dark satanic mills that were yet to appear...

4  
SO JOHN HE PRAYED TO LUDD THE KING, WHO CAME WITH FIRE AND DOOM,  
HE WAS CARRYING GREAT ENOCH AND HE SMASHED THE POWER LOOM.

&C.

*Shots, MURDER* A shot rings out; then another. From behind the wall on the other side of the road,  third, from the other side of the road. "Murder", calls out Horsfall, and starts to fall from his horse.

5  
THE MASTER DRIVES THE SOLDIERS, AND THE SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR,  
AND FOURTEEN MEN OF YORK-SHY-ER ARE HUNG FOR BEING POOR.

&C.

Pub, death.

No-one speaking. A couple of week's after Horsfall's assassination, assiassination of Prime Minister, Spencer Percival. A trial would be held within three days, a hanging three days after that.

Twisting in; oaths.

Prisnce Regent proclamation, a reward and a pardon for anyone giving up the miscreants, even if they had been involved. [Benjamin Walker] 

At the first trial, for murder, George Mellor, Thomas Smith and William Thorpe.

...

In all, seventeen men would be hung: Mellor, Thorpe and Smith for murder — after their hanging they would be anatomised and dissected, as was the custom — then fourteen more, in two batches of seven.

In each case, SILENCE.

Guards - to prevent any attempt at escape.

As the crowd stood silent, those at the front, near to the platform, could perhaps here Mellor's final words:

__SOME OF MY ENEMIES MAY BE HERE TODAY. IF THEY ARE, I FORGIVE THEM. JUST AS I HOPE THE WORLD WILL FORGIVE ME.__

[FAREWELL]

*THE BLANKETEERS' TALE*

It wasn't just the Luddites, of course, who gave their name to protest movements. There are many other tales we might have told, other songs we might have sung; of protest movements from the centuries before, or the few short years and decades after: of the Diggers, and the Levellers, who fought against the loss of the commons, and the enclosure of land; of Kett's Rebellion, and the Reformation Oak; of the Pentrich Rebels, who sought to march on London and overthrow government by popular revolt; or the Cato Street Conspirators, who had planned an armed attack, using cutlasses and guns, on the members of the Cabinet as they dined together. As men found guilty of High Treason, the Pentrich rebels and the Cato Street conspirators would all suffer the ultimate penalty, not just of hanging — but also beheading. But those are all tales for another day. As are the stories of the Rebecca Rioters, and the Tolpuddle Martyrs and the followers of Captain Swing, tales of which, and songs of which, we hope to be able to share with you another day.

Because for now, there is time for just one more tale. Of the Blanketeers.

It's 1817. Tensions are high. The Ludding times are over, the date set for the last of the Luddite trials, in April, for attacks on Heathcoat and Boden's mill in 1816, a trial at which 8 more men will be sentenced to hang.

The government is fearful of revolt. ...

Prince Regent

Blanketeers

Several years later, St Peter's Field was in the news again: as the site of the Peterloo Massacre where EIGHTEEN people died and hundreds were injured.

No convictions.

Purse man got lost.

It is said that one man made it to London, to present the petition, one man who left St Peter's Field with a blanket over his shoulder and petition on his chest.

What difference it made, who can say? But we can stil tell the story.

A few years later, the workers of Manchester were marching again, protesting against low wages, high prices, and FOOD POVERTY, heading out from Manchester, and over the Pennines into Yorkshire, pulling the plugs out of the large boilers that generated the steam the powered the factory looms, and in so doing, destroying the furnaces __AND PUTTING A STOP TO THE WORK OF THE MILLS.__

[PLUG DRAWERS SONG]
