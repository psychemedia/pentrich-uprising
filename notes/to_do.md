I, AB, of my own free will and accord do hereby promise and swear that I will never reveal any of the names of any one of this secret Committee, under the penalty of being sent out of this world by the first Brother that may meet me. I furthermore do swear, that I will pursue with unceasing vengeance any Traitors or Traitor, should there any arise, should he fly to the verge of ---- I furthermore do swear that I will be sober and faithful, in all my dealings with all my Brothers, and if ever I decline them, my name to be blotted out from the list of Society and never to be remembered, but with contempt and abhorrence, so help me God to keep this our Oath inviolate.

Ned Ludd, a mythical character, in whose name these things are done. But Ned Ludd is not any one person. Rather like Jack, the hero of many a traditional tale, Jack, the everyman, Ned Ludd is an every-man of the working people. He may not exist as a person, but he exists as an idea. And as local leaders rise up and gather men together to act in his name, in a sense, they become him. They all become him.

March 1816 New Radford - frames owned by Topham,

And so we find ourselves back at Pentrich. Remember Pentrich, fifteen miles or so — a half day's walk — North West of Nottingham, where in late 1816 and early 1817, ?? Topham had ?? destroyed? Pentrich.
