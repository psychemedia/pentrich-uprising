Annals of Hyde and district, containing historical reminiscences of Denton, Haughton, Dukinfield, Mottram, Longdendale, Bredbury, Marple, and the neighbouring townships

pp.47-51

A severe trade depression — the result of the taxation levied on account of the continuous wars in the reign of (George III — caused great distress among the operative class in the first decade of the present century; and the manifestation of the popular feeling which then took place at both Manchester and Stockport, received ample support from the inhabitants of Hyde.

THE LUDDITES.

The agitations known as the Luddite Riots, in the years 1811-1812, also caused great excitement in this neighbourhood. The riots owed their name to the fact that the insurgents announced they were under the direction of a leader designated by the fictitious name of Ned Ludd or General Ludd. Hence they themselves Lxidds or Luddihs. The avowed purpose of the rioters was the destruction of machinery, the use of which had greatly superseded manual labour. To bind their adherents to the purpose of their order, they administered the following oath: —

"I ————, of my own voluntary will, do declare and swear that I never will reveal to any person or persons under the canopy of heaven, the names of any of the persons composing the secret committee, either by word, deed, sign, or by address, marks, or complexion, or any other thing that may lead to the discovery of the same, under penalty of being put out of the world by the first brother whom I may meet; and of having my name and character blotted out of existence. And I do further swear that I will use my utmost endeavours to punish with death any traitor, or traitors, who may rise up against us, though he should fly to the verge of existence. — So help me God to keep this oath inviolable."

An attempt to counteract this oath was made and placards to the following effect were issued:—

"The villain who takes this oath deprives himself of that liberty which is the birth-right of all Britons, deprives himself of trial by jury, and binds himself the willing slave of the vilest and most blood-thirsty assassins and incendiaries. He not only puts himself out of the protection of the laws, but he deprives other men of the power of assisting him: at least while he keeps his oath a secret, and refuses to reveal the purposes and objects of this detestable conspiracy. Thus all the deluded wicked wretches who are bound by this oath, are, at this moment, exposed to the greatest dangers, and are liable to be assassinated and put to death in the most cruel manner by any of their companions.

Again this oath is an offence against man, as it defeats the purpose of human justice, and enables the assassin and murderer to escape with impunity because the traitors who have taken this oath, weakly and wickedly suppose that it supersedes all moral and religious obligations, and think that such a compact which they have entered into, releases them from any duty which they owe to God, their King, and their country."

It is said that the oath was so prevalent in Lancashire and Cheshire that even boys of 16 were known to have taken it. The ceremony of administering this oath was known as "twisting in."

The neighbourhood of Hyde was an active recruiting ground for the insurgents, and so keenly was the power of the rioters felt that the military were reijuisitioned to keep the peace. The officer commanding the detachment stationed in this neighbourhood— Captain Raines (formerly an officer in the light dragoons) — published his memorial of the struggle in 1817, and his account of the movement of the troops is full of interest. The Scotch regiment, in which Captain Raines was serving, and whose Colonel was the Duke of Motrose, was then stationed in Kent, and was ordered to repair northwards by forced marches in waggons. The account states — "Being on leave of absence in London, I only heard of the march of the regiment through the public journals. I instantly followed it, and joined at Leicester... Resuming our station in the waggons we proceeded with all expedition to Macclesfield, where a route awaited us for Ashton-under-Lyne. On our arrival there an order came by a dragoon to detach one company to Mottram; for this duty I was selected, and repaired thither accordingly.

Reports were frequently brought to me that the Luddites assembled every night within a short distance of our quarters for the purpose of drilling and holding their conferences, notwithstanding our piquets were constantly patroling, they never had the good fortune to fall in with any of them. I afterwards learned they had spies continually watching our movements, who conveyed intelligence to the main body of the road the soldiers took. I proposed to Mr. Lightfoot, the curate of the parish, who was well acquainted with the country, to accompany me and two soldiers for the purpose of ascertaining whether these people did actually assemble — he gladly accepted my proposal. We commenced our patrol about 12 o'clock at night, and after being out little more than an hour, we fell in with some of their look-out parties at the edge of a moor, about a mile and a half from Mottram. As we advanced we discovered them in great numbers, and though I had ordered my men to conceal their arms and turn their caps, it now appeared soldiers were discovered to be at hand from the general flight which ensued. We followed them, running as fast as we could, the men now showing their arms and pretending to call for the piquet. It was with the greatest difficulty I could keep the soldiers from firing; they were Highlanders, possessing all the ardour the natives of their country are remarkable for, zealous and hearty in the cause we were engaged in. I soon found it would be prudent to secure a retreat, whilst it was yet in our power, as from the numbers springing up in all directions, I saw we should shortly become the pursued instead of the pursuers; we therefore took refuge in a ditch, where we waited till the coast was clear."

Captain Raines' account contains frequent reference to most of the places in the district. The page succeeding the one from which the above extract is derived relates "the circumstance of the Luddites discovering that one, William Cooper, of Newton, commonly known as Bill Strapper, was an informer; and of their meeting, and deliberate agreement that Cooper 'should be put out of the world,' according to the tenor of the oath by which they were bound." Anxious for the safety of this man. Captain Raines offered him protection, but after two nights' stay with the military. Cooper decided to go home. "He returned, however, in the greatest consternation, having found that his home had been visited during the night by the Luddite.s, who threatened to murder his wife and children if they did not tell where he was." Shortly afterwards news was spread of a murder in Newton, and the body of a man was discovered near Cooper's house. It transpired, however, that it was the body of one Samuel Crabtree, and from all appearances it seemed probable that he owed his death to the accidental discharge of his own pistol, which he had placed loaded in his pocket. Newton figures largely in Captain Raines' account, and several important arrests were made in the township. "These transactions," says the Captain, "took place on a Sunday. It was a very wet day, and most of the inhabitants of Newton were at home, but immediately the alarm was given, every man who knew himself to be guilty did not long continue there."

The following fragments from old documents will prove of interest. In the Military Order dated Roe Cross, 27th Aug., 1812, occurs this passage;—

"Captain M'Dougal arrived this morning. I have given him instructions. He will proceed to-morrow night to dee Cross."

Hyde, 28th August, 1812.  
Mr. Hyde Clarke's compliments to Captain Raines, that he has eworn in the oath of allegiance to 95 men, but there will be with him to-morrow he believes 50 or more. H. C. has had a great deal of his business to attend to yesterday and to-day, so put them off till to-morrow. Jamos Smith, of Dukinfield, — weaver, was sworn in by James Haigh, as also John Spragg at the same time. John Spragg, weaver, in Dukinfield, *twisted in* three months ago, by James Haigh. James Smith works with John Spragg, and *twisted in* at the same time Spragg was, by Jamos Haigh. I can see only the two above that James Haigh has *twisted in*. Spragg works for William Taylor, of Ashton. I believe this James Haigh is a great rogue. Excuse haste.

H. C. will be in Stockport on Monday.

The termination of the Luddite Riots was marked by the presentation of a piece of plate (valued at 100 guineas), bearing the following inscription:—

> Presented November 4th, 1812, to Captain F. Raines, by the inhabitants of Mottram and its vicinity, as a testimony of their gratitude for the eminent services rendered them in his indefatigable and successful efforts to suppress the spirit of disaffection rapidly extending itself through that county.

Mottram, it should be stated, was looked on as a convenient centre or headquarters for the military appointed to keep the peace in the neighbourhood of Hyde.

The whole of this district seems to have been plunged in a state of turmoil common at that time to all the manufacturing centres of England. A glance at the public journals of the day shows that almost every local township is represented on the list of prisoners to be tried for acts of riot and disorder. The "Gentleman's Magazine," in its report of the trials at Chester, on May 25th, 1812, entimerates a long list of local offences, including riots at Bredbury, Staley, Stockport, Mottram, TintwistIe, and finally sums up with the following:—"William Walker, dignified with the name of "General Ludd," for riot and seizing flour from Ralph Booth, of Gee Cross. James Crossland, for destroying machinery and threatening the life of one Robert Thornily, cotton spinner. All above were found guilty." Among other local disturbances was an attack made (during transit) on a number of power looms manufactured by the Marlers, of Newton, for the East Lancashire cotton trade. The lorries containing them were seized and burned, and the looms broken or otherwise destroyed. Many of the Luddites concerned in these local risings were transported, while others fled the country and settled abroad, some of them, it is said, embarking in and carrying on successfully the trades they had been engaged in here.

A LETTER TO THE LUDDITES.

FRIENDS AND FELLOW COUNTRYMEN,

At this time, when the cause of freedom is making a progress which is as cheering to the hearts of her friendsas it is appalling to those of her enemies, and, when it is become evident that nothing can possibly prevent that progress from terminating in the happiness of our country, which has, for so many years, been a scene of human misery and degradation; when it is become evident that so glorious a termination of our struggles can be now prevented only by our giving way to our passions instead of listening to the voice of reason, only by our committing those acts which admit of no justification either in law or in equity ; at such a time, can it be otherwise than painful to reflect, that acts of this description are committed in any part of the kingdom, and particularly in the enlightened, the patriotic, the brave town of Nottingham?

The abuse which has been heaped upon you by those base writers whose object it is to inflame one part of the people against the other; the horrid stories which have been retailed about your injustice and cruelty; the murderous punishments which these writers express their wish to see inflicted on you; the delight which they evidently feel when any of you come to an untimely end; all these produce no feeling in my mind other than that of abhorrence of your calumniators. The atrocious wickedness of charging you with the burning of Belvoir Castle, in support of which charge there has not been produced the slightest proof, in spite of all the endeavours to do it and all the anxiety to fix such a crime upon you; this alone ought to satisfy the nation, that it can rely upon nothing which a corrupt press has related. But, still it is undeniable, that you have committed acts of violence on the property of your neighbours, and have, in some instances, put themselves and their families in bodily fear. This is not to be denied, and it is deeply to be lamented.

However enlarged our views may be; however impartial we may feel towards our countrymen, still there will be some particular part of them whose conduct we view with more than ordinary approbation, and for whom we feel more than ordinary good will. It is impossible for me, as a native of these Islands, not to feel proud at beholding the attitude which my countrymen are now taking; at hearing the cause of freedom so ably maintained by men who seem to have sprung up, all at once, out of the earth, from the North of Scotland to the Banks of the Thames. At Glasgow, at Paisley, at Bridgton, throughout the noble counties of York and Lancaster, and in many other parts besides the Metropolis, we now behold that which to behold almost compensates us for a life of persecution and misery. But, still, amidst this crowd of objects of admiration, Nottingham always attracts my particular attention. I have before me the history of the conduct of Nottingham in the worst of times. I have traced its conduct down to the present hour. It has been foremost in all that is public-spirited and brave; and, I shall be very nearly returned to the earth when my blood ceases to stir more quickly than usual at the bare sound of the name of Nottingham.

Judge you, then, my good friends, what pain it must have given me to hear you accused of acts, which I was not only unable to justify, but which, in conscience and in honour, I was bound to condemn! I am not one of those, who have the insolence to presume, that men are *ignorant* because they are *poor*. If I myself have more knowledge and talent than appears to have fallen to the lot of those who have brought us into our present miserable state, it ought to convince me, that there are thousands and thousands, now unknown to the public, possessed of greater talent, my education having been that of the common soldier grafted upon the plough-boy. Therefore, I beg you not to suppose, that I address myself to you as one who pretends to any superiority in point of rank, or of natural endowments. I address you as a friend who feels most sincerely for your sufferings; who is convinced that you are in error as to the cause of those sufferings; who wishes to remove that error; and, I do not recollect any occasion of my whole life when I have had so ardent a desire to produce conviction.

As to the *particular* ground of quarrel between you and your employers, I do not pretend to understand it very clearly. There must have been faults or follies on their side, at some time or other, and there may be still; but, I think that we shall see, in the sequel, that those circumstances which appear to you to have arisen from their *avarice*, have, in fact, arisen from their want of the *means*, more than from their want of *inclination*, to afford you a competence in exchange for your labour; and, I think this, because it is their *interest* that you should be happy and contented.

But, as to the use of *machinery in general*, I am quite sure, that there cannot be any solid objection. However, as this is a question of very great importance, let us *reason it together*. Hear me with patience; and, if you still differ with me in opinion, ascribe my opinion to *error*, for, it is quite impossible for me to have any *interest* in differing with you. But, before we proceed any further, it may not be amiss to observe, that the writers on the side of Corruption are very anxious to inculcate notions *hostile* to machinery as well as notions hostile to Bakers and Butchers. This fact alone ought to put you on your guard. These men first endeavour to set the labouring class on upon their employers; and, then they call aloud for troops to mow them down.

By *machines* mankind are able to do that which their own bodily powers would never effect to the same extent. Machines are the produce of the *mind* of man; and, their existence distinguishes the civilized man from the savage. The savage has no machines, or, at least, nothing that we call machines. But, his life is a very miserable life. He is ignorant; his mind has no powers; and, therefore, he is feeble and contemptible. To shew that machines are not naturally and necessarily an evil, we have only to suppose the existence of a patriarchal race of a hundred men and their families, all living in common, *four men* of which are employed *in making cloth by hand*.

Now, suppose some one to discover a machine, by which all the cloth wanted can be made by *one man*. The consequence would be, that the great family would (having enough of every thing else) use *more cloth*; or, if any part of the labour of the three cloth-makers were much wanted in any other department, they would be employed in that other department. Thus, would the *whole* be benefited by the means of this invention; the whole would have more clothes amongst them, or more food would be raised, or the same quantity as before would be raised, leaving the community more leisure for study or for recreation.

See ten miserable mariners cast on shore on a desert island with only a bag of wheat and a little flax seed. The soil is prolific; they have fish and fruits; the branches or bark of trees would make them houses, and the wild animals afford them meat. Yet, what miserable dogs they are! They can neither sow the wheat, make the flour, nor catch the fish or the animals. But, let another wreck toss on the shore a spade, a hand-mill, a trowel, a hatchet, a saw, a pot, a gun, and some fish-hooks and knives, and how soon the scene is changed! Yet they want clothes, and, in order to make them *shirts*, for instance, for 7 out of the 10 are constantly employed in making the linen. This throws a monstrous burden of labour upon the other *three*, who have to provide the food. But, send them a *loom*, and you release 6 out of the 7 from the shirt making concern; and *ease* as well as plenty immediately succeed.

In these simple cases the question is decided at once in favour of machines. With regard to their effects, in a great community like ours, that question is necessarily more complicated; but, at any rate, enough has been said to show, that men cannot live in a civilized state witheut *machines*; for, every *implement* used by man is a *machine*, machine merely meaning *thing* as contradistinguished from the *hand of man*. Besides, if we indulge ourselves in a cry against machines, *where* are we to *stop*? Some misguided, poor, suffering men in the county of Suffolk, have destroyed *threshing* machines. Why not *ploughs*, which are only *digging* machines? Why not *spades*, and thus come to our *bare hands* at once? But, why *threshing* machines? Is not the *flail* a machine? The corn *could* be *rubbed* out in the hand, and winnowed by the *breath*; but, then, nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand of us must starve, and the few that remained must become savages.

I will not insult that good sense, of which the men of Nottingham have given so many striking proofs, by pushing further my illustrations of the position, *that machinery in general is not an evil*. But, the great question to be decided, is, whether machinery, *as it at present exists, does not operate to the disadvantage of journeymen and labourers, and is not one cause of the misery they now experience?* This is the great question to be decided. But, before I enter on it, give me leave to shew you, that the *corrupt* press, by which you are so much abused, is actually engaged in the work of sending us back by degrees into the savage state just described!

There is a paper in London, called the Courier, which is always praising the acts of the government and always abusing the Reformers in the most gross and outrageous manner. The Morning Chronicle asserts that the proprietor of this paper has regular communications with the offices of government. I do not know how this may be; but, certain it is, that, through thick and thin, it praises the acts of the government. This paper, on the twenty-first instant, contained the following paragraph:— "Amongst other employments for the poor, it is recommended, that parishes should furnish themselves with *hand corn-mills*; that *parish bake offices* should be established; and that the *women and girls* should be employed in spinning and carding of wool. In Essex many hands have been employed to *shell beans in the fields*, which has been done so low as *3d. per bushel*, a sum *under that usually paid for threshing*. By this means, the beans are got *quick to market*, first being dried upon the kiln, with the advantage of not being bruised, as they must otherwise have been, if threshed with a flail."

This is actually a bold step towards the savage state. It is exceedingly foolish, buf, as I shall presently show, exceedingly mischievous also; or, at least, it would be so, if the people had not too much sense to be misled by it. The mind of man has discovered a mode of preparing corn for making him food by the use of brooks, streams, rivers, and the wind. His mind has subjected the water and wind to his controul, and compelled them to serve him in this essential business. But, these barbarians would tain render his discoveries of no avail. They would deprive us of the use of the *Wind* and the *Water* in this respect, and set us to grind our corn *by hand*. Still, hand-mills are *machines*. Come, then, let us resort to Robinson Crusoe's *pestle and mertar*. No: those are *machines*. Why, then, let us, like cattle, grind the corn with our *teeth*!

TO DO

But, what good are these hand-mills to do the poor 2 Letus see. There is one mill in Hampshire which is capable of grinding and dressing 200 sacks of wheat ina day. ‘The men employed in and about this mill are, or would be if in full work, about ¢welve. Now, there are about 200 parishes in Hampshire. Suppose each has a hand-mill, capable of grinding and dressing a sack in a day, and that is full as much as can be done by two able men. Here are four hundred men and two hundred machines employed to do that which would bea great deal better done by éwelve men and one stream of water! Aye, but this would find employment for 400 men! Employment! Why not employ them ‘* to fling stones against the wind?" What use would their labour be to any body? May they not as well be doing nothing as doing no good? In short, if the powerful assistance of the Wind and the Water were thrown aside in this important business, we should find ourselves making a rapid progress towards the feebleness of savage life.

‘¢ Bake-houses :'' parish bake-houses,

are recommended ; and, for what? People now bake at their own houses, if they choose, and yet they find, in general, that there is little economy in so doing. Why, then, this new invention? It is a gross folly. Why not recommend us all to make our own shoes, our own hats, and so on throughout all the articles of dress and of furniture? Why is the baker's trade become more unnecessary now than at any former period? But, the folly is here surpassed by the mischievousness; because this recommendation has a tendency to excite popular discontents against the bakers, and to cause such acts of violence as form an excuse for the calling forth of froops. Seeing, that this is a matter of great importance, I will lay before you a statement of the Baker's profits, by which you will see how unjust are all the attacks which are made upon The best way, however, to satisfy your minds upon that description of persons.

this subject is to suppose the same man to be both Miller and Baker, and to show you how much a Load of Wheat is sold for to the Miller, and how much it brings back from the public when paid for by them in the shape of bread. There is no man in England better able to speak confidently upon this subject than I am, having myself catsed corn to be ground into

flour by a horse-mill, under my own ime

mediate inspection and superintendance,

and having verified all the particulars with the greatest exactness. This very year I have sold wheat at market, and, at the same time, have ground the same sample of wheat into flour for my own use and that of my labourers. Thus I know to a certainty the profits of the Miller and the Baker both put together, and my wonder has been, that they find the means

I speak of a Load of wheat, because my experiments have been made upon that quantity. A Load is 40 Winchester Bushels. A load of my wheat weighing 581ib. a bushel, and, in the whole, 23491b. yielded me 1487Ib. of flour, fine and seconds; but, I take it, 1475lb. of fine flour, and 807Ib. of Bran, Pollard, and what we call Blues. The 1475}b. of flour made 1890Ib. of Bread, according to repeated experiments. The distribution of the Load of Wheat stood thus:

Weight of Wheat 2349

The waste arises partly from what goes off in dust about the mill, but chiefly from the cvaporatim which takes place when the grain comes to be bruised, because, though apparently quite dry and hard, there is a certain portion of moisture, or else there could be no vegetation in the grain, and, it is the small remnant of this vegetative principle, which causes the flour to swell. Ifdried upon a kiln, wheat will never produce light bread. Now, as to the money part of the concern.

The 1475lb. of flour made 1890lb. of bread, or 438 quartern loaves, at 4lb. 50z. each. The offal was worth, at the market price, a penny a pound weight. The Bakers in the village sold bread at the same time, at 1s. Id. the quartern loaf.

Here, then, is 8/. 11s. Od. more than the wheat cost. But only think of what is to be done for this sum! The wheat to be put into the mill; beer for the carters ; the grinding and dressing of the wheat; the sacks to put the flour and offal into  the carrying out of the flour and the offal; a delay in the sale; interest of the £19 and of all those other out-goings ; trust and bad debts ; the taxes on the Miller's horses, on all he uses and consumes. Then comes the Baker. Fire for his oven; yeast; labour in making the bread; labour in sending great part of it out; rent of his house; all his numerous taxes; trust and bad debts; and payment for his time. Is it not wonderful, that a lead of wheat can be manufactured into bread and distributed at so cheapa rate? But, in order to shew you what would be the consequence of destroying the trade of a Baker, let us suppose the flour of this load of wheat bought by 26 good large families, who require about a bushel of flour each a week. Here would be 26 ovens to heat and 26 women employed during the better part of a day. This would be acost double in amount to the Baker's profit; and, what then would be the case, if there were 50 or 70 ovens to

heat? My good friends, I know it from very careful observation, that no family can afford to bake their own bread, even where they have ovens, unless they have their fuel for nothing; and I know, too, that labourers, who live in cottages of my own, who have nice little ovens and fuel for nothing, who yet purchase their bread of the Bakers in the village, if their wives have any sort of employment in the fields ; and, they have convinced me, that, if the wife lose a day's work in a week for the sake of baking, they dose by baking their own bread.

What, then, can be more foolish, more unjust, and more dastardly, than to fall with fury upon this useful, this necessary, class of men? And, what can be more base and wicked than the efforts which the corrupt press is making to cause you to believe that a part, at least, of your sufferings arise from what they villainously call the extortions of bakers and butchers? There is no trade which yields so little profit as that of the baker. The butcher comes next ; and, must it not be ¢lear to every one, that, if these trades made darge profits, many more persons would go into these trades? Every man wants to get money, and, if money was to be gotten in so simple a way, would there not be plenty of people to come forward to get it ?

The story of women and children shell. ing beans in the field at three-pence a bushel, must be false. But, if true, is it possible for any human being to shell in that way a bushel a day, while it is well known that a man with a flail will thresh more than twenty bushels of beans in a day, and be in the dry and be clean and warm all the while! But this is such miserable nonsense, that I will not any longer detain you with further notice of it. Satisfied, that you will be convinced, from what has been said and from the operation of your own good sense, that there is no just ground for anger against bakers and butchers, and that the eause of your suffering must he very diffe. rent from that of any extortions on the part of such tradesmen.

 I shall now return to the subject of machines, and beg your patient attention, while I discuss the interesting question before stated: that is to say, Whether machinery, as it at present exists, does, or does not, "operate to the disadvantage of journeymen and labourers."

The notion of our labourers in agriculture is, that Threshing Machines, for instance, injure them, because, say they, if it were not for those machines, we should have more work todo. This is a great error.. For, if, in consequence of using a machine to beat out his corn, the farmer does not expend so much money on that sort of labour, he has so much more money to expend on some other sort of labour. If he saves twenty pounds a year in the article of threshing, he has that twenty pounds a year to expend in draining, fencing, or some other kind of work; for, you will observe, that he does not take the twenty pounds and put it into a chesé and lock it. up, but lays it out in his business; and:his: business is to improve his land and to add to the quantity and amount of his produce. Thus, in time, he is enabled to feed more mouths in consequence of his machine, and to buy, and cause others to buy, more clothes than were bought before; and, as in the case of the ten sailors, the skill of the mechanic tends to produce ease and power and happiness.

The threshiog machines employ women and children in a dry and comfortable barn, while the men can be spared to go to work in the fields. Thus the weekly income of the labourer who has a large family, is, in many cases, greatly augmented, and his life rendered so much the less miserable. But, this is a trifle compared with the great principle, upon which I am arguing, and which is applicable to all manufactories as well as to farming; for, indeed, what is a farmer other than a manufacturer of Corn and Cattle?

That the use of machinery, generally speaking, can do the journeyman manufacturer no harm, you will be satisfied of in one moment, if you do but reflect, that itis the quantity of the demand for goods that must always regulate the price, and that the price of the goods must regulate I shall show by and by how the demand, or market, may be affected by an alteration in the currency or money of a country.

The quantity of demand for Lace, for instance, must depend upon the quantity of money which the people of the counWhen the means of expending are abundant, then a great quantity of Lace will be bought ; but, as those means diminish, so will the purchaBut, in every state of a country, in this respect,

ses of Lace diminish in amount.

the effect of machinery must be the same. There will always be a quantity of money to spare to expend in Lace. Sometimes, as we have seen, the quantity of this mo. ney will be greater, and sometimes it will be less; but, in no case do I see, that machinery can possibly do the journeyman lace-maker any harm. Suppose, for instance, that the sum which the whole nation have to expend in Lace, be

100,000 pounds a year; that the number of yards of Lace be 500,000; and that the making of the Lace, at 401. a family, give employment to 2,500 families. The

demand for only one hundred thousand yards instead of five hundred thousand There would still be 2,500 families employed in Lace-making, at 40l. a

year for each family; but, at any rate, no advantage could possibly arise to you from the change, because the whole quantity of money expended in Lace must remain the same.

Precisely the same must it be with regard to the Sfocking and all other manufactures. But, while the destruction of machinery would produce no good to you with regard to the home trade, it would produce a great deal of harm to you with regard to the foreign trade; because it would make your goods so high in price, that other nations who would very soon have the machinery, would be able to make the same goods at a much dower price.

I think, then, that it is quite clear, that the existence of machinery to its present extent cannot possibly do the journeyman manufacturer any harm ; but, on the contrary, that he must be injured by the destruction of machinery. And, it appears to me equally clear, that if machines could be invented so as to make Lace, Stockings, &c. for half or a quarter the present price, such an improvement could not possibly be injurious to you. Because, as the same sum of money would still; if the country continued in the same state, be laid out in Lace, Stockings, Xc. here would bea greater quantity of those goods sold and used, and the sum total of your wages would be exactly the same as it is now.

But, if machinery were injurious to you now, it must always have been injurious to you; and there have been times, when you had no great reason to complain of So that it is evident, that your distress must have want of employment at any rate.

arisen from some other cause or causes. Indeed, I know that this is the case ; and, as itis very material that you should have a clear view of these causes, I shall enter into a full explanation of them; because, until we come at the nature of the disease, it will be impossible for us to form any

opinion as to the remedy.

Your distress, that is to say, that which you now more immediately feel, arises from want of employment with wages sufThe want of

such employment has arisen from the want of a sufficient demand for the goods you make. The want of a sufficient demand for the goods you make has arisen from the want of means in the nation at large to purchase your goods. This want of means to purchase your goods has arisen from the weight of the taxes co-operating with the bubble of paper-money. The enormous burden of taxes.and the bubble of paper-money have arisen from the war, the sinecures, the standing army, the loans, and the stoppage of cash-payments at the Bank; and, it appears very clearly to. me, that these never would have existed, if the Members of the House of Commons had

been chosen annually by the people at large.

Now, in order to shew, that taxes produce poverty and misery generally, let us suppose again the case of a great Patriarchal Family. This family we suppose to consist of many men and their wives and children ; we suppose them all to labour in their different branches ; and to enjoy each of them the same degree of wealth and comfort and ease. But, all at once, by some means or other, nine or ten of the most artful men make shift to impose a tax upon the rest; and to get from them in this way enough to support themselves and their wives and children without any work atall. Is it not clear that the taxed part of the community must work harder or fare worse in consequence of this change? Suppose this taxing work to go on, and the receivers of taxes to increase, till one half of the whole of the produce of What misery must the payers of tares then be-

all the Jabour be taken in taxes. gin to endure? It is certain that they must be punished in two ways; first by an addition to the hardness of their work, and next by a reduction of their former food and clothing. ‘They must, under such circumstances, necessarily become skinny, sick, ragged, and dirty.

For, you will observe, that those who would live upon the tares, would each of them eat and drink and wear ten times as much as one oi the poor mortals who were left to labour and to pay taxes. As these poor creatures would be unable to lay up any thing against a day of sickness or old age, a poor-house must be built to prevent them from actually dying by the road-side, and a part of the taxes must be laid out to

support them in some way or other till they expired, or, if children, till they should be able to work.

There can be no doubt, that such would be the effect of heavy taxation in this case; and the same reasoning applies to millions of families, only the causes and effects are a little more difficult to trace. Now, you will observe, that I do not say, that ne faves ought to be collected. Our vile enemies impute this to me; but, my friends, [ have never said it or thought it. In a large community of men, there must be laws to protect the weak against the strong; there must be administrators of the laws; there must be persons to hold communications with foreign powers ; there must be, in case of necessary wars, a public force to carry on such wars. All these require taxes of some sort ; but, when the load of taxes become so heavy as to produce general misery amongst all those who pay and who do not recéive taxes, then it is that taxes become an enormous evil.

This is our state at present. It is the sum taken from those who labour to be given to those who do not labour which has produced all our present misery. It has been proved by me, but, which is better for us, it has been expressly acknowledged by Mr. Preston, who is a lawyer of great eminence, the owner of a large estate in Devonshire, and a Member of Parliament for a Borough, that the labourer, who earns eighteen pounds a year, pays ten pounds of it in taxes. I have before observed, but I cannot repeat it too often, that you pay a tax on your shoes, soap, candles, salt, sugar, coffee, malt, beer, bricks, tiles, tobacco, drugs, spirits, and, indeed, on almost every thing you use in any way whatever. And, it isa monstrous cheat in the corrupt writers to attempt to persuade you, that you pay no taxes, and upon that ground to pretend, that you have no right to vote for Members of Parliament. In the single article of salt, it is very clear tome, that every one of our labourers who has a family, pays more than a pound every year. The salt is sold in London, at 20s. a bushel, wholesale ; but, if there was no tax, it would not exceed, perhaps, 3s. a bushel. Every labourer with a family must consume more than a bushel, which does not amount to more than the third part of half a pint a day; and, you will bear in mind, that there is salt in the bacon, the butter, and the bread, besides what is used in the shape of salt.

Now, is it not clear, then, that you do pay taxes? And, is it not also clear, that the sum, which you pay in taxes is just so much taken from your means of purchasing food and clothes? This brings us back to the cause of your want of employment with snfficient wages. For, while you pay heavy taxes, the Landlord, the Farmer, the Tradesman, the Merchant are not exempt. They pay taxes upon all the articles which they use and consume, and they pay direct taxes besides, on their houses, lands, horses, servants, &c. Now, if they had not to pay these taxes, is it not clear, that they would have more money to expend on labour of various kinds; and, of course, that they would purchase more Stockings and more Lace than they now purchase. —A farmer's wife and daughters, who would lay out 10 pounds in these articles,

cannot so lay it out, if it be taken away by the tax-gatherer ; and so it is in the case of the Landlord and the Tradesman.

I know a country town, where a couple of hundred of pounds used to be expended on a fair-day, in cottons, woollens, gloves. linen, &c. and where, at the last fair, not fifty pounds were expended.— The country shop-keeper not wanting the goods to the same amount as before, the London wholesale dealer does not want them to that amount; and as he does not want them from your employers, they do not want your labour to the same amount as before. So that they are compelled te refuse you work, or, to give you work at low wages, or, to give away to you their property and means of supporting themselves and their families, which, in reason and justice cannot be expected.

Then, there is another very injurious effect produced by this load of taxes.— The goods made by you cannot be so cheap as if you and your employers had not so heavy taxes to pay. Thus, foreign nations, which are not so much loaded with taxes, can afford to make the goeds themselves as cheap, or cheaper, than you can make them. Formerly, when our taxes were light, the Americans, for instance, could not afford to make Stockings, Broad Cloth, Cutlery, Cotton They now make them ai//, and to a vast extent !

Goods, Glass Wares, Linens.

They have machinery of all sorts, manufactories upon a large scale, and, what is quite astonishing, they, who, before our wars against the French people, did not grow wool sufficient in quantity for their hats and saddle-pads, now grow fine

wool sufficient for their own manufactories of cloth, and to export to Europe !

This change has been produced whelly by the late wars, and more especially by our Orders in Council and by our Impressment of Native American Seamen, which last produced the war with America, to carry on which both pariies, the INS and the OUTS, most cordially joined. ‘That war finished what the Orders in Council had begun. It compelled the Americans to manufacture; and, in order to protect their own manufactures, the government of that country has naturally passed laws to check the import of ours. Thus, it is my good friends, that the manufacturers of England, Scotland and Ireland, have lost a considerable part of the custom of ten millions of farmers and farmers' wives and children. I foresaw this consequence, in 1811; and 1 most earnestly, at that time, in a series of Letters to the Prince Regent, besought the government not to enter into that fatal war. It was, however, entered into; my advice was rejected, and the manufacturers and merchants of this kingdom are now tasting the bitter fruit of that disgraceful war, which, after having cost about fifty millions of money, was given up in the teeth of a solemn declaration to the contrary without having effected any one of the objects for which it was professed to have been begun and prosecuted.

Thus, then, my fellow countrymen, it is not machinery; it is not the grinding disposition of your employers; it is not improvements in machinery; it is not extortions on the part of Bakers and Butchers and Millers and Farmers and Corn-Dealers and Cheese and Butter Sellers.

It is not to any causes of this sort that you ought to attribute your present great and cruel sufferings; but wholly and solely to the great burden of taxes, cooperating with the bubble of paper-money. And, now, before I proceed any further, let me explain to you how the papermoney, or funding, system has werked us all. This is a very important matter, and it is easily understood by any man of plain good sense, who will but attend to it for a moment.

Before the wars against the French People, which wars have ended in replacing our king's and country's old enemies, the family of Bourbon, on the thrones of France, Spain and Naples, and which have restored the Inquisition that Napoleon had put down; before those wars, the chief part of the money in England was Gold and Silver. But, even the first war against the people of France cost so much money, that bank-paper was used in such great abundance, that, in 1797, people became alarmed, and ran to the Bank of England to get real money for the notes which they ‘held. Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Mr. Paine. The Bank could not pay their notes! The Bank Directors went to Pitt and told him their fears. He called a Council, and the Council issued an order to the Bank to refuse to pay their promissory notes in specie, though the notes were all payable to the bearer and on demand. The parliament afterwards passed an Act to protect Pitt, the Council, and the Bank Directors against the law, which had been violated in these transactions!

From this time, there has been little besides paper-money. This became plenty. and, of course, wages and corn and every thing became igh in price. But, when the peace came, it was necessary, to reduce the quantity of paper money ; because, when we came to have intercourse with foreign nations, it would never do to


case, for about ¢hiricen shillings. The Bank and the Government had it in their power to lessen the quantity of paper. Down came prices in a little while; and if the Dedt and Tares had come down too in the same degree, there would have been no material injury; but, they did not. Taxes have continued the same. Hence our ruin; the complete ruin of the great mass of farmers and tradesmen and small landlords; and hence the misery of the people.

But, some of the taxes have been taken off. Yes; about 17 millions out of 70, or about a fourth part. But, the papermoney has been diminished in a greater degree, and, of course, farm-produce in the same degree as paper-money. Bread and Corn sell pretty high, owing to a bad harvest; but we must take ai/ the produce of a farm, and you will soon see how the farmer has been ruined.

Thus, our produce has fallen off 69/. out of £109. 18s. Od. and our taxes have been reduced only 17/. in every 70/. This has been the effect of the paper-money bubble. I speak this with a certain knowledge of the facts. I myself have 8 beau-

tiful Alderney Heifers, with calf, for which I cannot obtain 4/. each. Four years ago I could have sold just such for 167. each. I have 12 Scotch Steers, for which I cannot obtain 5/. each. Just such ones, at Barnet fair, only in 1813, I saw sold for 13/. each. This has been the effect of paper-money; and by this cause have thousands upon thousands of farmers been already wholly ruined, while thousands upon thousands more are upon the threshold of the jail.

Here, then, we have the real causes of your sufferings, of the sufferings of all the labourers, all the farmers, all the tradesmen, and, in short, of every class, except those who live upon the taxes.

If, as I observed before, the taxes had been iowered in the same degree as the farm produce, the distress would not have been much greater than before ; that is to say, if the sum total of the year's taxes had been reduced from 70 millions to about 26 millions. But this could not be done, while the interest of the Dest was paid in full at 5 per cent. while an army of 150 thousand men was kept up; and while all the pensions and sinecures and the Civil List were kept up to their former amount; and, besides these, all the pay of the Naval and Military People and all others, living, in any way, upon the taxes.

And why should such an army be kept up? There was a time, when a man would have been looked upon as mad, if he had proposed to keep up any standing soldiery at allin time of peace. But, why not reduce pay and salaries? The Judges, for instance, had their salaries doubled during the war, and so had the Police Justices and many others. When the Wuies (the famous Whigs!) were in office, they augmented the allowances of the Junior branches of the Royal Family from 12 thousand pounds each to 18 thousand pounds each, per year. The allowance to the King, Queen, &c. called the Civil List, was augmented enormously. Now,

30, 1816. [698

you will observe, that all these augmentations were made upon the express ground, that the price of Provisions had risen. Well, provisions fa//, and down come the wages of journeymen and labourers ; and why, in the name of reason and of justice, should not the salaries of the Judges, and the pay and allowances of all others in public employ come down too? What reason can there be for keeping all these up, while your wages have come down?

Then, as to the DEBT, why should those who have lent their money to the government to carry on the wars; why should, they continue to be paid in full at 5 per cent. interest in the present money? It is the bubble of paper-money; it is the bubble which they have helped to make, which has reduced my Alderney Heifers from 161. value to 41. and why am I and you and all the rest of us to pay them as much as we used to paythem? The greater part of them dent their money to the government, when the pound note was not worth more than ha/f what it is worth now, if we take all circumstances into view ; and, what right, then, have they to be paid in full in the money of the present day? Yet, they are paid in full, and I am compelled to give them as much tax out of the price of a Heifer worth 4 pounds, as I used to give them out of the price of the Heifer worth 16 pounds. You will see, and you will fee/ most severely, that corn is now dear. But, this is owing to the short crop and dad harvest. This high price is no good to the farmer; but, a most terrible evil. If he should get 15s, 2 bushel for his wheat instead of 7 or 8s. he will receive no more money; because he will not have more than Aa/f the quantity to sell. If I sell a hog at 15s. a score instead of 8s. I do not gain by the high price; because, I am, from the shortness of my crop of corn and the badness of the corn, not able to fat more than half as many hogs as I should have been able to fat, if the crop had been good and the harvest fine. So that, you will clearly see, as to the present high price of corn and bread, that it cannot be any benefit at all to the farmer, and cannot at all tend to enable him to pay the enormous taxes that now press him out of ex. istence.

Thus have I laid before you the real causes of your sufferings. You see, that they are deep-rooted, of steady growth, and that they never can end but in consequence of some very material change in the mode of managing the nation's concerns, They have arisen from the taxes and loans; those arose out of the wars; the wars arose out of a desire to keep down Reform; and a desire to keep down Reform arose out of the Borough System, which excludes almost the whole of the people from voting at elections. It isa maxim of the English Constitution, that no man shall be taxed without his own consent. Nothing can be more reasonable than this. But, as I have shown, we are all taxed; you pay away half your wages in taxes; but, do you all vote for Members of Parliament? If the Members of Parliament, for the last fifty years, had been chosen hy the people at large, and chosen annually, agrecably to the old laws of the nation, do you believe, that we should have expended one thousand millions in taxes raised during the wars, and another thousand millions which is now existing in the shape of Dest? This, is not to be believed; no man can believe it. And, therefore, as the want of such a Parliament is the real root of all our sufferings, the only effectual remedy is to obtain such a parliament. A parliament, annually chosen by all the people, seeing that they all pay taxes.

In 1780 the late Duke of Richmond brought a bill into the House of Lords to restore the people to their right of having such a parliament; Pirr co-operated in this work with the Duke of Richmond; gad Pitt expressly declared, in a speech in Parliament, that, until the parliament was reformed, it was "impossible for English Ministers to be honest." Therefore, this is no new scheme; it is a mea. sure long contended for and well digested: it may be carried into effect with perfect safety to every rank in society; and, it is my firm persuasion, that it is the only means of preserving order and peace. Indeed, I am of opinion, that it is the hope of seeing this measure adopted; that it is the expectation that it will be adopted, which now preserveg that tranquillity in the country, which isso honourable to the understanding and the hearts of the people. God send that this expectation may not be disappointed!

In order, that it may not, the people of every class should assemble and petition the Parliament for reform. No matter how many or how few, no matter whether in Counties, Cities, Towns, Villages, or Hamlets. We have all a right to petition; to perform that right is a sacred duty; and to obstruct it a heinous crime. But in these petitions, the only essential object should be a Reform; for, though the want of it has produced numerous and great evils, still this is all that need be petitioned for, seeing that a Reform would cure all the evils at once. Trade, commerce, manufactures, agriculture, all would soon revive, and we should again see our country free and happy- But, without a Reform, it is impossible for the nation to revive, and, I believe, it is also impossible to prevent utter confusion.

How vain, how stupid, then, are all the schemes of the writers on the side of Corruption for making employment for the poor! And how base all their attempts to persuade the people, that their sufferings can be alleviated by what are called "‘ charitable subscriptions," which are, in fact, only so many acts of insolence towards the numerous and unhappy sufferers, who are paying, in the shape of *taxes* one half of the little that they earn by their labour!

These Corrupt writers, in order still to cajole anddeceive the people, (who, thank God! are no longer to be d ‘eceived) recommend to the Landlords and Farmers to make employment for the poo rt by causing commodious roads, foot-paths, and causecays to be undertaken; by causing shellfish to be gathered for manure, by causing lime, chalk, marle, &c. to be gotten and prepared; by causing land to be drained and embankments made! What folly, or what an impudent attempt to deceive! Why, these are some of the very things that the poor would be employed in if the Landlords and Farmers had money to give in wages; and, if they have not money to give in wages, how are they to have money to bestow in these works at all!

As to the "charity subscriptions," the people seem to understand the object of them perfectly well. Lorn Cocurane sent them forth to the nation, strzpped of their mask, for which we are deeply indebted to him, and which debt of gratitude we are not so base as not to pay. The people of Grascow led the way in their indignation against the Soup-shop and tts Kettle. At Wican, at OtpHAm and several other places, where Meetings of the Subscription Tribe have been held, the people have told them, that they waht not Soup and Old Bones and Bullock's Liver; but they want their rights. Indeed, these attempts to hold pretended charitad/e meetings are full of insolence. ‘Those who are unable to work, or to find work, have a legal right to be supported out of taxes raised on the rich and on ali Houses and all Lands. Why, then, are they to be held outas beggars 2? Why are self-erected bodies to insult them with their pretended charity? It is not the poor, who have brought the nation into its present state. It is not they who have ruined so many farmers and tradesmen. The daw says that they shall be relieved; and, why are they to look to any other relief than this, until the state of the nation can be amended?

But, before I conclude, let me beg your attention to a very curious fact or two as to the employment of the taxes which you and all of uspay. In No. 18 of the Register, which contains an address to Journeymen and Labourers in general, [ noticed, that, in the account, which was laid before Parliament in the year 1815, there was a charge for money paid to suffering Firench and Dutch Emigrants, and also to the Poor Clergy of the Churcn of England. -But, I observed, that I did not know, whether any such charges were containe d in the accounts laid before Parliament this year, 1816. I have that account before me now, and, what will be your feelings, how will you feel towards the Soup-Kettle Fraternities, when you are told. that there are, even in this last account, a charge of seventy-five thousand pounds for the relief of French and Dutch Emigrants, and of one hundred thousand pownds for the poor Clergy of the Church of England! ‘vais is, you will observe, quite a new thing. Never till the time of Perceval was a ny minister bold enough to take money, « yr, to get the parliament to vote money, out of the taxes, paid by the poor as well as the rich, to be given to the poor Clergy of a Church, whose dignitaries and beneficed p eople are bursting with wealth, and who receive in various ways, more than five milli. ns a year! What! And have these Subs, cription gentry the impudence to look yo 4 in the face while these things-exist? Ha ve they the impudence to talk of their ch. wity towards you, while they say not a word against seeing you taxed to help to mak: 2 up the immense sums thus given in char. tty to the French and Dutch Emigrants and to the Clergy of the Church of England? Put these pithy questions to the ins solen.t Societies of the Soup-Kettle, and tell me what they can say in their defence. What! Are you to


TO DO ABOVE

come crawling, like sneaking curs, to lick up alms to the amount of *forty* or *fifty* thousand pounds round the brim of a Soup Kettle, while you are taxed with the rest of us to the amount of *one hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds* in order to give *relief* to French and Dutch Emigrants and to the poor Clergy of the Church of England! I do hope, that there are none of my countrymen who will be so base. I trust, that they have yet English blood enough left in their veins to make them reject such alms with scorn and indignation.

If I had room, I would lay before you an account of some of the other articies of expense, to defray which you are taxed; but, as I intend, within three or four weeks, to shew you how all the taxes are expended, I shall now conclude this long letter by expressing my hope, that it will be proved by your subsequent conduct not to have been written wholly in vain.

For past errors I make ali possible allowance. We all fall into errors enough naturally; and, no wonder that you should have adopted erroneous notivns, seeing that the corrupt press has, for so many years been at work, to deceive and mislead you. This base press, knowing what would be the inevitable consequence of your seeing the *real causes* of your calamities, has incessantly laboured to blind you, or to direct your eyes towards an imaginary cause. Machines, Bakers, Butchers, Brewers, Millers; any thing but the *taxes* and the *paper-money*. In all the acts of violence, to which you have been led by these vile hirelings you have greatly favoured the cause of corruption, which is never so much delighted as at the sight of *troops* acting against the people. Let me therefore, most earnestly beseech you to think seriously on these matters; to stay the hand of vengeance against your townsmen and countrymen, and to harbour that feeling to the latest hour of your lives against all that is corrupt and detestable. I have taken the liberty freely to offer you my advice, because I have full confidence in your good sense and your public spirit. The hirelings have endeavoured to exasperate you by their revilings and menaces; I, knowing that brave men are not to be abused or bullied into compliance, have endeavoured to gain you by an appeal to your sense of honour and of justice. The hirelings call aloud for sending forth penal statutes and troops to put you down; I send you the most persuasive arguments my mind can suggest and all the kindest wishes of my heart.

And, with these wishes, I hope I shall always remain,

Your friend, Wm. Cobbett.

The next Register will consist of a LETTER to the worthy LORD MAYOR, on the errors which are new afloat about the *Soup Kettle*, &c. under the sanction of his name.

George Mellor, Thomas Smith, and William Thorpe.
Friday, January 8th, A.D. 1813 The above three culprits were executed at the new drop behind the Castle walls.

George Mellor, aged 32, cloth-dresser, of Longroyd Bridge; Thomas Smith, aged 22, cloth-dresser, of Huddersfield; and William Thorpe, aged 23, cloth-dresser, of Huddersfield. The jury were charged with the prisoners in the usual form, upon an indictment which alleged that the prisoner Mellor, on the 28th of April last, fired a pistol loaded with bullets, &c., at "William Horsfall, by which firing he received a mortal wound on the left side of the belly, of which wound he languished till the 30th of April, and then died; and that the prisoners Thorpe and Smith were present, aiding and abetting Mellor to commit the said Crime, and that the three prisoners wilfully murdered the said William Horsfall. The jury found them all guilty, and sentence of death was passed upon them by Justice Le Blanc. Their bodies were afterwards delivered to the surgeons for dissection.

FOURTEEN MALEFACTORS.

Saturday, January IGiA, AD. 1813.— The following fourteen malefactors were executed on the drop behind the Castle, for various burglaries, felonies, and tumultuously assembling in the night-time, to destroy shearing-frames, machinery, to collect fire-arms, and to demolish mills, particularly that of Mr. William Cartwright, at Rawfolds, in Leveredge, near Berstall.

John Swallow, aged 37, late of Briestwhistle, near Wakefield, coal-miner.
John Bailey, aged 31, late of Thornhill, near Wakefield, clothier, &c.
Joseph Fisher, aged 33, late of Briestwhistle aforesaid, coal miner

The above three unhappy men were convicted (together with John Lamb, who was afterwards reprieved), of a burglary in the house of Samuel Moxon, of Upper Whitley, in the West Riding of the county of York. They went armed and in disguise to the said Samuel Moxon's house on the night of the 3rd of July last, and feloniously entered the place, and by threats of violence obtained several notes, some silver, a quantity of butter, and wearing apparel.

Job Hey, aged 40; John Hill, aged 36; and William Hartley, aged 41, were convicted of a burglary in stealing fire-arms in the night-time out of the house of Sir. George Haigh, of Copley Gate, in Skircote, near Elland, in the parish of Halifax, farmer. These men went to the said George Haigh's house armed with pistols, and, having by intimidation procured admittance, succeeded in obtaining by violence and threats a gun and a pistol, &c. While they were knocking at the door, Mr. Haigh got up, and standing upon the stair inquired, "Who's there?" The answer from without was — "Our master, General Ludd, has sent for your fire-arms" — they had got the gun and pistol. They said to his servant, "Tell your master that if he does not sell his milk in the neighbourhood at two pence per quart, they would visit him again on a similar purpose." The principal witness against them was an accomplice in the robbery. The pistol was found in the house of Job Hey, also three pounds and a quarter of gunpowder.

James Hey, aged 25.
Joseph Crowther, aged 31; and
Matthew Hoyle, aged 46, were convicted of robbery, in the house of James Brook, of Fair Town, in the parish of Huddersfield, on the 29th day of November last, and stealing a one-pound note, a three-shilling piece, and putting the persons therein in bodily fear.

These three men were mere robbers, and do not appear to have any other object in view but the obtaining of plunder. In the course of the same night they plundered several other houses in the neighbourhood of Fair Town, in the said West Riding, and at the close of their wicked expedition shared the profits, amounting to £15 each.

James Haigh, aged 23, late of Dalton, clothier.
Jonathan Dean, aged 30, late of Huddersfield, cloth-dresser.
John Ogden, aged 28, late of the same place.
John Walker, aged 31, late of the same place; and
Thomas Brook, aged 32, late of Lockwood, near Huddersfield.

The five culprits, after a trial which lasted the whole day, were convicted on a statute of the 9th of George III., which made it a capital felony to demolish, or to begin to demolish, any mill of any description whatsoever. It appears that these deluded men, in company with George Mellor and William Thorp, who commanded on that of upwards of one hundred other persons, marched in military order and array, being armed with guns and pistols, axes, hammers, &c, such as are used for breaking stones on the highways, and attacked the mill of Mr. Cartwright, of Rawfolds (about six miles from Huddersfield), who used machinery obnoxious to the people employed in the dressing of cloth, and which they unhappily conceived to be destructive to their regular work. The attack was made on the night of the 11th of April last, and commenced with a discharge of guns and pistols. They were resisted with great spirit by Mr. Cartwright, and two of the assailants were mortally wounded and died soon after. Great numbers of these misguided men were afterwards apprehended, but only eight were brought to trial. The above five were convicted, three acquitted, and the rest discharged by proclamation, or on bail.

The whole of the above unhappy men were truly penitent when they ascended the scaffold, and all joined in singing that beautiful hymn in the Wesleyan Hymn Book — "Behold the Saviour of mankind, &c.

Buckley Arms, Stockport, April 14, 1812. "The rioters were headed by two men, dressed in women's clothes, who were called General Ludd‘s wives."
