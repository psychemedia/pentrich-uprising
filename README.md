# Protest Tales: Luddites and Rebels

A long-standing interest in the Luddites, combined with the rebel tale of the "Pentrich Uprising", a story I first heard via a [Ferocious Dog song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqwEsFnAqg4), provided the idea for this set.

The original plan was to try to give it an outing in the Rebel Tent, at Beautiful Days, in 2024... *If anyone can help me secure that gig, I'll get a round in... :-)*

## Tradtional story set

A WIP set of traditional tales — the story is what's left when the facts have been forgotten — that start and end in Pentrich, or thereabouts, but also wander into neighbouring counties.

### 1811 - opening tale

### 1812 — machine-breaking and murder

Mills are attacked by the machine bnreakers, and defended by the mill-owners. When two Luddites are killed during an attack on Cartwright's mill, at Rawfolds, revenge figures highly, with terrible consequences, and a mass execution.

### 1813-15 - an occasional outrage

### 1816 - a final Luddite flourish

### 1817 - several state trials, and rebellion...

Around the country secret committees meet to push for Parliamentary Reform, and the alleviation of the suffering of the poor. A gentleman from London proves helpful in sharing knowledge about what is going on elsewhere, in London, in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. But helping whom?

A date is set for insurrection and a peaceful revolution at the same time as the trial of Thistlewood et al. Two gatherings are notable: in Huddersfield, and in Pentrich. The leaders of the Huddersfield insurgents are put on trial at the Assizes at York, but acquitted following a journalistic scoop by the Leeds Mercury: the discovery of a spy. The State Trial in London also sees the acquittal of the defendants. But for the leaders of the Pentrich uprising, they are not so lucky...
