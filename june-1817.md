York Herald - Saturday 14 June 1817

At about 20 minutes after eight o'clock on Monday morning, Watson, Hooper, Preston, and Thistlewood, were brought from the Tower to Westminster-Hall, in four glass coaches.— In each coach were four Yeomen of the Guards and one prisoner; and the whole procession was escorted by two troops of Life Guards. They passed over London Bridge, through the Borough, and over Westminster Bridge. When they arrived in Palace-yard, the prisoners got out of their respective coaches, in the order in which we have ,mentioned their names, and were conducted each between two Yeomen of the Guards, through a lane of constables, to the wicket at the great entrance into the Hall.

At 20 minutes to nine o'clock, Mr. Watson was ushered into Court by a party of the Yeomen of the Guards. He was dressed in a suit of black, and carried under his right arm a book ; he bowed respectfully to the Court, and took his seat immediately behind the bar.

The Captain of the Yeomen, or Gentleman Jailor, and the Lieutenant of the Towerand the Lieutenant of the Tower, took their seats to the left of Watson. Preston was next ushered into Court, attended by another party of Yeomen of the Guards ; he was also dressed in black; he appeared cheerful, and cordially shook hands with Watson : a party of Yeomen also escorted him. Hooper next made his appearance, and was dressed in black; he also shook hands with Watson and the rest. Thistlewood came in last ; he looked ill ; was dressed in a sailor's jacket and trousers, and wore a black handkerchief. He manifested a great anxiety to speak to Watson, and on his approach to him shook him heartily by the hand. Sixteen Yeomen of the Guards sat by the side of and behind the prisoners.

Before the proceedings commenced, the prisoners frequently conversed together.

Precisely at nine o'clock the Attorney-General entered the Court. At a quarter past nine Mr. Justice Bailey, Lord Ellenborough, Sir. Justice Abbott, and Mr. Justice Holroyd entered ; and on the Court taking its seat, Mr. Serjeant Copley stated, that the front row was so far occupied by the Yeomen of the Guards, that there was not room for the prisoners' Counsel.

Mr. Gurney, who was of Counsel for the Crown, told his learned friend the inconvenience of which he complained should soon be remedied.

The Attorney-General said, he understood that the prisoners intended to challenge the Jurors, therefore he should, on the part of the Crown, claim that the prisoners be tried separately, and he should now state, that he should first put Mr. James Watson the elder on his trial. It would still be necessary that the other prisoners should remain in Court, but they could retire into the second row. This would afford that room and accommodation to his learned brother Copley, which he desired.

The arrangement was accordingly made— Thistlewoood, Hooper, and Preston, withdrew into the second row, whilst Dr. Watson remained in the front row, with Major Runnington and a Yeoman of the Guards on one side of him, and his Counsel, Mr. Laws and Mr. Rigby, on the other.

Mr. Barlow, Secondary of the Crown Office, then proceeded to call over the Panel ; several applications were made by individuals to be excused attending, on the plea of ill health, and other causes.

The names of the Jurors were then called over. — Thistlewood, Preston, and Hooper were then withdrawn behind Watson, and Watson remained in the centre of the Court, behind the King's Counsel. Several of the Jurors were fined 20l. for not being present when called upon.

A great number of persons were challenged both by the Counsel for the Crown, and also by the Counsel for the prisoner.

The following Gentlemen were then sworn of the Jury :—

Thomas Allrhack, Prince's-street, Conduit-street, bookseller.  
Robert Norton, Pickett-street, Temple-bar, button-maker.  
J. Tomlinson, Bedfordbury, Covent-garden, woollen draper.  
P. Richardson, Charing-cross, Lottery-office-keeper.  
John Briant, Wapping-street, anchor-smith.  
Samuel Kell, Red Lion-street, Holborn, carpenter.  
Richard Ramsden, Brook-street, Holborn, capilaire-maker.  
William Phillips, Holborn, ironmonger.  
T. W. Barker, Kirby-street, Hatton-garden, silversmith.  
Richard Perkins, Red Lion-street, Holborn, shoemaker.  
Wm. Hathlock, Holywell-street, Shoreditch, currier.  
Samuel Knight, High-street, Norton Falgate, druggist.

Proclamation was made in the usual way as soon as the Jury was sworn, and then Mr. Barlow, the Officer of the Court, proceeded to read the Indictment. After the first count thereof was read,

Lord Ellenborough interposed, and observed, that as all the other counts had annexed to them the same series of Overt Acts, he supposed that it would not be required by either party to have the whole of these repeated and repeatedly read over.

Mr. Weatherall, on the part of the prisoner, said, it could not be the wish of the Gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Copley) to cause the least unnecessary trouble or delay, but on the contrary their wish was to prevent both. The officer of the Court then, by the consent of all sides, only recited the general counts, four in number of the indictment, without reciting the Overt Acts.

The substance of the whole may be considered as fully comprised in the following extract:

"The jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do farther present, that the said Arthur Thistlewood, James Watson the elder, James Watson the younger, Thomas Preston, and John Hooper, being subjects of our said Lord the King, not having the fear of God in their hearts nor weighing the duty of their allegiance, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil, as false traitors against our said Lord the King, and wholly withdrawing the love, obedience, fidelity, and allegiance, which every true and faithful subject of our said Lord the King, should and of right ought to bear toward our said Lord the King, on the 2d day of December in the 57th year of the reign aforesaid, with force and arms, in the said parsh of St. James, Clerkenwell, in the said county of Middlesex, together with a great multitude of false traitors, whose names are to the said Jurors unknown, to the number of five thousand and more, arrayed and armed in a warlike manner that is to say with flags, banners, and ensigns, swords, pistols, clubs, bludgeons and other weapons, being then and there unlawfully, maliciously and traitorously assembled and gathered together against our said Lord, the King, most wickedly, maliciously and traitorously did levy and make war against our said Lord the King, and being so assembled together, arrayed and armed against our said Lord the King, as aforesaid, did then and there with great force and violence, parade and march in an hostile manner through divers public streets and highways, and did then and there maliciously and traitorously attempt and endeavour, by force and arms, to subvert end destroy the government and constitution of this realm, as by law established; and to deprive and depose our said Lord the King of and from the style, honour, and Kingly name of the Imperial Crown of this realm, in contempt of our said Lord the King and his laws, to the evil example of all others, contrary to the duty of the allegiance of them the said Arthur Thistlewood, James Watson the elder, James Watson the younger, Thomas Preston and John Hooper, against the form of the statue [*sic*] in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our said Lord the King, his Crown and dignity. "

At one o'clock the Attorney-General rose to address the Jury ; which he did in a speech that occupied two hours in the delivery. After having stated the history of the transactions, he endeavoured to identify with them the prisoner James Watson; and concluded by asserting, that he possessed indubitable evidence of the criminality of the prisoner.

The first witness called was Thomas Storer, a printer in Fetter-lane, who had refused to print the petition, and a hand-bill inviting a meeting in Spa-fields.

Arthur Seal, another printer in Tottenham-court-road, proved his having printed 8OOO large and small bills for said meeting, copies of which were read. The evidence of two other witnesses was rejected.

John Monkhouse, of the Merlin's Cave, deposed that about 20,000 persons were present at and near his public-house and grounds among whom were Mr. Rainsford, the magistrate, and many peace-officers.

J. Fitzpatrick and V. G. Dowling both deposed to seeing Watson and Preston at the meeting; and the former stated that Preston said it was a glorious day. Mr. Dowling was giving a minute history of the transactions, when Sir. Serjeant Copley and Mr. Weatherall took the most important objection that will probably be made during the trial— that the speeches to which the evidence here applied, ought to have been set out in the indictment as overt acts of treason. The Court, however, over-ruled the objection, thinking they were set out with sufficient precision.

[Here Lord Ellenhorough said, that the Court expected that no part of the proceedings should be made public, pending the trial, on pain of contempt.]

Mr. V. G. Dowling was at this time under examination. When his examination was concluded.

Mr. Dowling addressed the Bench, and observed, that he had to solicit their Lordship's attention to himself. Their Lordships had just intimated their pleasure that no part of the proceedings should be published till the trial was concluded. Unfortunately, being ignorant of their Lordship's determination, a Paper with which he was connected, had already published a full account of the proceedings up to a late hour, and unfortunately they, sinning in ignorance, had already sent if out into the world.

Lord Ellenborough observed, what was already done could not be remedied ; those who had thus published the proceedings of the Court, whilst yet in an unfinished state, had done it at the peril of being punished for a contempt. Should any one, however, presume to publish any part of the proceedings, after this notice, till the whole was finished, the Court would not fail to visit the offender with its severest animadversion.

At eight o'clock the Court adjourned till nine o'clock on Tuesday morning. Four Officers having been previously sworn in to take charge of the Jury, who are lodged at the King's Arms Tavern.

The prisoners were removed from the Court under the same escort with which they came down in the morning; a large crowd had collected in the Hall to see them taken from the Court, and as they proceeded down the Hall to take coach at the great gate, they were loudly greeted by the populace.

The trial of James Watson, sen. was resumed on Tuesday. The following witnesses were examined for the Crown :— C. Shearman the younger, C. Shearman the elder, and Mr. J. Stafford, Chief Clerk at Bow-street Police-Office, Mr. Beckwith, Mr. Platt, Mr. Rae, Mr. Brandon, Mr. Hall Limberick, the Bow-street Officer, Mr. Middleton, of Skinner-street, Sir J. Shaw, Mr. White the common councilman, Mr. Hayward, a stock-broker, two privates of the Coldstream Regiment of Guards, and several others.

Their Lordships being under the necessity to attend certain term business this evening, Lord Ellenborough intimated at half past five o'clock, that the Court would proceed no further this day than to conclude the witness then under examination. The examinations terminated a few minutes before six o'clock, at which time the Court adjourned.

The above law proceedings were again resumed on Wednesday, and are not expected to close before Friday next. But we must forbear giving further particulars till the whole is over.

Bell's Weekly Messenger - Sunday 15 June 1817

Disturbances in the Midland Counties

Intelligence was received from Derbyshire at Nottingham on Sunday last, that a rising was intended in various counties, including Nottinghamshire, next day. Precautions were consequently taken at Nottingham. Monday very rainy day, and few persons more than usual came into the town in the early part of the day;

Seme WEEKLY MESSENGER. were armed with fire-arms, the rest with pikes. Their numbers were increasing:, and they committed jrreat depredations. 

From Huddersfield, the following intelligence has been received:—

Huddersfield, June 9 1817.  
"In consequence of information received by the Magistrates, the Huddersfield Yeamanry were ordered out yesterday, and, between this place and Honley, came up with party of Rioters, reported to amount to some hundreds. The Rioters discharged several shots, and wounded the horse of Mr. David Alexander. They afterwards dispersed. It does not appear that any of them were taken.—All is quiet to-day."

The following accounts from Nottingham were receive Wednesday:—

Nottinyhanij o'clock, June 10. u The disaffected have proceeded to acts of outrage and Some pikes have b.x'n brought in. The Yeomanry corps have been called out between Derby and this town. One man stated to have been shot by the Rioters, who refused to deliver up the arms contained in his master’s house.

" The Magistrates, Mundy and Rolleston, have each proceeded with a body of cavalry, but no intelligence has yet been received from them.

are swearing in Special Constable*, and adopting every precaution to preserve quiet."

Relative to the alarming projects of the disaffected in Yorkshire, the following additional particulars are extracted;— Nottingham, i June, o'clock. It was agreed the Magistrates that Mr. Rolleston, who is intimately acquainted with (he county, should go and reconnoitre the positions and movements of the disaffected—whilst Mr. Muudy should proceed the barracks and get the military ready. Mr. Rollcstou acc.ovdingly went to Eastwood, and when he got near them, was stopped three men, armed with pikes. returned to Nottingham, and proceeded with a party of dragoons; Mr. Mundy heading another party.

As soon as they had come within half a mile of the disaffected they observed that (he latter appeared alarmed at the sight of the military. One nan among them, however, who was on horseback, attempted rally and form them across the road, the cavalry neared them, they fled in all directions— The cavalry pursued and took several prisoners, who were immediately sent off to Nottingham jail. Nothing could more firm or forbearing than the conduct of the military for notwithstanding the most abusive language used, and that all the disaffected taken were aimed, not one of them was hurt by the cavalry. The cry of the disaffected was for a complete change,—for Revolution.

Leeds, June 10.—On Sunday evening last, as a picquet of four of Captain Armitage's troop of Yeomanry Cavalry were in the discharge of their duty, in the immediate neighbourhood of Huddersfield, they fell in with a numerous assemblage of disaffected persons, some of whom fired upon them, and one their horses was shot. The Yeomanry retreated to head quarters, and returned with a reinforcement; of which circumstance the mob were probably aware, they had dispersed themselves in the interim.

TRIALS FOR HIGH TREASON. WESTMINSTER HALL, COURT OF KING'S BENCH. Monday, June 9. At eight o'clock this morning, the prisoners Watson, Thistlewood, Preston, and Hooper, were brought into Court by the Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, and a guard of Yeomen. On taking their seats without the bar, the Yeomen took their stations in a row behind them, and on each side of them. The Deputy Warden of the Tower sat on the left of Watson, and the Prisoner's Counsel also sat behind the bar. The time previous to the arrival of the Judges the Prisoners occupied in close conversation.

Precisely at nine o'clock the Altorney-General entered the Court. At quarter past nine Mr. Justice Bailey, Lord Ellenhorough, Mr. Justice Abbott, and Mr Justice Holroyd, entered; and the Court taking its seat, Mr. Serjeant Copley stated, that the front row was so far occupied by the Yeomen of the Guards, that there was not room for the prisoner's Counsel.

Mr. Gurney, who was of Counsel for the Crown, told his Learned Friend the inconvenience which he complained should soon be remedied.

The Attorney-General said, he understood that the prisoners intended to challenge the Jurors, therefore he should, the part of the Crown, claim that the prisoners be tried separately, and he should now state, that he should first put Mr. James Watson the elder on his trial. It would still be necessary that the other prisoners should remain in Court, but they should retire into the second row. This would afford that room and accommodation to his Learned Brother Copley, which he desired.

The arrangement was accordingly made ; Thistlewood, Hooper, and Preston, withdrew into the second row, whilst Dr. Watson remained in the front row, with Major Runnington and a Yeoman of the Guards on one side of him, and his Counsel, Mr. Laws and Mr. Rigby, on the other.

The prisoners were removed from the Court under the same escort with which they came down in the morning a large crowd had collected in the Hall to see them taken from the Court, and as they proceeded down the Hall to take coach at the great gate, they were loudly greeted the populace. Tuesday, June The trial of James Watson, sen was resumed. At nine o'clock the Jury, who had been accommodated at the King's Arms Tavern, Palace-yard, with beds, under the care of four officers, previously sworn not suffer them to have communication either by writing or any other way, with any person whatever, entered the jury-box. About a quarter after nine o'clock, Lord Ellenborough and the other Judges entered the Court, and the Jury having been called over, a number of witnesses were examined : the whole course of the examination of whom had reference to the particulars already known ?? the Spafields meetings the 15th November and 2d December last, and the riots in the City on the latter day. The Court adjourned at six to nine o'clock on Wednesday morning are of course prevented from giving the particulars the evidence. Watson a man of very firm countenance, but with a small head and close over-hanging brows; his eyes are small and light: seldom moves. Preston seems the most cheerful and most at ease; though none of them appear deficient in firmness. Thisllcwood has rather a coarse appearance, which probably in part arises from his dress. Hooper has light eyes and hair, and his complexion is pale. A considerable crowd were in Westminster-Hall, but the utmost order prevailed. 

Wednesday, June 11 This morning the State Prisoners arrived at Westminster- Hall, at quarter past eight, and having been brought into Court, Watson was placed as usual in the front, and the others immediately behind him. The first witness examined was the Bow-street horse patrole, who stopt Watson at Highgatc on the night of the of December. His examination did not occupy more than half honr. The next witness was Castles, from whose information the particulars of the alledged treason have been chiefly derived, and whose examination commenced at half past nine o'clock in the morning and did not conclude till six in the evening. The cross-examination was postponed till Thursday. At few minutes after Six the Court adjourned. The Court was more crowded than on any former day of the Trial. number noblemen were again present from the time the Court met to the close of the day. About five o'clock, whilst Castles was still under examination, The Attorney-General said, hoped the Court would pardon his interrupting the course of examination but observing the Sheriff was now present, he thought it right to advb-e him, that in consequence of certain papers which had, during the day, been circulated, and were even at that instant, circulating amongst the populace in the Hall, it was necessary should adopt every possible precautionary measure to guard against mischief. The Learned Counsel then handed seme papers the Bench which just been distributed i?i the Hall and the avenues leading thereto. One of these placards was as follows; “Britons will free. We want more -V!r. Bellinghams." The crowd in the Hall was this time excessive, and continued to increase til! the lime which the Court rose, when not only the Hall, but Palace-yard, Wc-uuinsterjridge, and Bridge-street, were thronged. strong guard l constables attended, and three troops Horse Guards snrj rounded the carriages which were waiting to convey the prisoners the Tower. When they came out C ,:;rt, they \ver«£ received with loud shouts and acclamations, and the carriages were followed hundreds of the populace over Weslminslerbridgo towards the Tower, and were only kept oif the exertions of the Horse Guards. Thursday, June 12 At early hour this morning the Jury walked for considerable time in Old Palace Yard, under the escort of the Sheriff's Officers, in consequence of the request made by them to Lord Ellenborough, and they did not back to their hotel breakfast inilil compelled the rain. T.ta officers were sworn take special care that one had any communication with them, and person was suffered to approach them. The prisoners reached the Court about quarter l o'clock, under similar escort the preceding days, and from their carriage, were again separately cheered by the populace. About half past nine the k spa's the Bench, and the names of the Jury bi-iiij called over. Mr. Wetherell coininvaced the cross-examination John tlio witness examined the Attorney General the part of the Crown, who was brought in custody. His first interrogations to this witness were ascertain whether he had had any communication with any person or persons, directly or indirectly, by writing, printing, otherwise, upon the subject his testimony the preceding day, all which interrogations answered in the negative. At half-past one o'clock the cross-examination and re-examination of the witness were finished by Mr. Wetherell for the defence, and Mr. Gurney for the Crown. It embraced an inquiry into the whole life and occupations the witness, who staled himself to Yorkshireman, and to have been a whitesmith trade. Ann Wright, who kept the public-house in East Smithfield, where Watson the elder went after the riot in the Minories, was the next wilnevs. She was examined by Mr. Richardson, cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Copley, and re-examined Mr. Richardssu. William Miller, sailor, who was in the lap-room Mrs. Wright's, was then called, and corroborated the evidence of lira. Wright. He was examined by Mr, Richardson, and cross-examined Mr.TVwtherell. Zac- Bannister, the landlord of the house in Hyde-strcet, Bloomsbury, in which young Watson lodged, was next called, John Vickery, the Police Officer, who searched the shop and privy in Hyde street, Bloomsbury, was the next witness.

THE RIOTS IN DERBYSHIRE, &c.

The following are the accounts that have reached us this morning. These disgraceful disturbances may, we think, be now considered as set at rest, at least for a time, the turbulent having been every where arrested in their career by the vigilance and activity of the Magistrates. We are concerned to state that two constables fell victims to the mad infatuation of the turbulent at Offerton, in Derbyshire :

FROM THE LICHFIELD MERCURY, FRIDAY, JUNE 13.

"We regret to have to record a Riot, attended with fatal consequences, at Offerton, about twelve miles from Derby. The intelligence reached this City early in the forenoon of Wednesday ; soon after which a detachment of infantry arrived in pursuit of two men who had made their escape; and who had been principal instruments in the affair by which two special constables had been killed. Two men, answering the description given, had passed through this City about two hours previously, taking the road to Walsall. One of the soldiers pushed on, and entered Walsall before the fugitives, who arrived by another route, they were both secured, and are now in custody.

" The above riot is said to be a part of a partial effort at insuriection, extending across the country into Yorkshire ; and, it is added, that some farther excsses may be immediately expected to take place. Several stands of arms were taken possession of by the mob, but the affair has terminated by the capture of about forty of them, who are lodged in Derby county gaol. The Derby Paper received yesterday is very *reserved* on this subject, but we believe that we are correct in stating that forty prisoners are in gaol, and that two special constables have fallen."

LICHFIELD MERCURY OFFICE: THURSDAY NIGHT.

"We stop the press to state, that we have just received intelligence from Nottingham. The prisoners brought in there had *completely filled the gaol* ; yet all the principal roads were covered with detachments of prisoners still coming in. Great numbers had refused to act as special constables, and Nottingham was in a state of considerable ferment and apprehension from the multiplicity of conflicting reports. The report of a plan of a partial rising, extending from Nottingham across a most populous district, to the extremity of Yorkshire, seems to have been pretty correct ; and before twenty-four hours expire, many interesting particulars of the result will be made known. All the yeomanry corps are out, and many of have made forced marcnes by night , of twenty and thirty miles in extent. From the circumstance of a great number of the prisoners being armed, we fear that more blood has been shed."

FROM THE LEICESTER JOURNAL, JUNE 13.

"Monday last, it is now known beyond a doubt, was fixed for the execution of those revolutionary scenes, thee commencement of which was so lately averted at Manchetster by a happy discovery of the atrocious design, there prepared for the destruction of the country. The very day on which the trials of the persons now charged with High Treason are proceeding with in London was, it appears, to have been also distinguished by the beginning of a civil war all over the kingdom ! But the vigilance of Government and of the Magistracy is too unceasing and universal for the disturbers of public tranquility, to have any chance of success in their desperate and wicked courses.

"Tuesday afternoon the Mayor and Magistrates received an express, informning them that a Simultaneous rising of the disaffected had taken place, at midnight, at South Winfield. and several other villages in Derbyshire. It appears that the mobs were armed with fire-arms, pikes, and other weapons, and were proceeding in a body to Nottingham. Magistrates *here* instantly adopted measures suited to the occasion, and we are happy to say that no disposition to disturbance was manifested in this town or neighbourhood.

"Wednesday morning the Mayor received another dispatch from Nottingham, stating that the mob from the North Western side of Derbyshire had advanced near to Eastwood, on their way to Nottingham. A party of the 15th Hussars, under Captain Phillips and Mr. Loft, accompanied by Mr. Rolloaston and Mr. C. G. Mundy, as Magistrates, set out to meet them. They got sight of them about a mile this side of Eastwood : the moment the insurgents saw the troops, they fled in all directions across the fields, and although they were pursued with great speed, the military could secure no more than eight and twenty—many of whom had arms in their hands.

"A very considerable number of loaded guns, pikes, pitchforks, and a few swords, have been collected, which the mob had thrown away in their flight. The fire-arms were all loaded, for the most part, with ball, but not a shot was fired. The pikes are new, very strong, of a formidable appearance, and considerable length. Many of the prisoners had powder and ball about them, and many bullets were found on the road. They had searched all the houses on their way for arms and ammunition, and men, whom they compelled to go with them. They declared all the way, *that Plunder was not their object, but to obtain their Right, and alter the Government*.— They seem to have committed no outrage, except that it was stated that one man was killed by them in Derbyshire. The military drove them out of the county of Nottingham into Derbyshire, where a great many were taken by the High Sheriff, with a troop of yeomanry of that county. All was quiet is Nottingham when the dispatch came away. Two troops of yeomanry were in the town, and scouts out on the Derbyshire side. Nothing can exceed the zeal, alacrity, and good spirit of the 15th Hussars, and 96th Infantry.

"The Yeomanry Cavalry of this county have received orders to hold themselves in readiness to assemble at a moment's warning, and the Magistrates are every where on the alert. Part of the Leicester troops of Yeomanry marched on Tuesday evening to escort seven State Prisoners through the Town, in consegnence of an express from the Magistrates of Sheffield ; but it appears that at Mansfield the King's Messengers in whose custody they were travelling took the direction of the North Road, on account of the disturbances which had broken out."

Manchester Mercury - Tuesday 01 July 1817

Derbyshire Insurrection.

An inquest has been taken by Mr. Gosling, the Coroner, upon the body of Robert Walter, Mr. Hepworth's servant, who was shot in the night Tuesday the 10th ult. in his master's house in Wingfield Park ; and a verdict of *Wilful Murder* has been returned by the Jury against William Turner, otherwise Manchester Turner, Robert Turner, Isaac Ludlam, William Ludlam, and William Barker.

It has come out in the examinations of the prisoners, now in custody in our county gaol, on charges of being concerned in the late treasonable outrages, that several of them were in situations far above want, being persons of small property, and that others were in the habit of earning from 15s, to 25s and upwards, weekly.— (*Nottingham Journal*.)

Ann Weightman, widow, who has kept the White Horse public-house at Pentridge, for several years was convicted before the Magistrates at the County Hall on Friday last, of having permitted seditious meetings, and particularly a meeting on Sunday the. 8th instant, to be held at her house; and her licence to sell ale was adjudged to be forfeited. — We hope and trust that this example will be followed in other places on the Nottinghamshire side of this county. We hear with great pleasure that strict enquiry will made into the conduct of the Duke of Devonshire's tenantry in Pentridge ; and that no man will be permitted to remain on his Grace's rental who has in any manner aided, or has been in the least degree concerned in the late insurrection.— *Derby Mercury*.
