Watson, Thistelwood trial etc - charges laid ; also press restrictions

...
Proclamation was made in the usual way, aa soon as the Jury was sworn, and then Mr. Barlow, the Officer of the Court, proceeded to read the Indictment. After the first count thereof was read,

Lord Ellenborough interposed, and observed, that as all the ether counts had annexed to them the same series of Overt Acts, he supposed that it would not be required by either party to have the whole of these repeated and repeatedly read over.

Mr. Weatherall, on the part of the prisoner, said, it could not be the wish of the Gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Copley) to cause the least unnecessary trouble or delay, but on the contrary their wish was to prevent both. The officer of the Court then, by the consent of all sides, only recited the general counts, four in number of the indictment, without reciting the Overt Acts.

The substance of the whole may be considered as fully comprised in the following extract:

"The jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do farther present, that the said Arthur Thistlewood, James Watson the elder, James Watson the younger, Thomas Preston, and John Hooper, being subjects of our saod Lord the King, not having the fear of God in their hearts nor weighing the duty of their allegiance, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil, as false traitors against our said Lord the King, and wholly withdrawing the love, obedience, fidelity, and allegiance, which every true und faithful subject of our said Lord the King, should and of right ought to bear toward our said Lord the King, on the 2d day of December in the 57th year of the reign aforesaid, with force and arms, in the said parsh of St. James, Clerkenwell, in the said county of Middlesex, together with a great multitude of false traitors, whose names are to the said Jurors unknown, to the number of five thousand and more, arrayed and armed in a warlike manner that is to say with flags, banners, and ensigns, swords, pistols, clubs, bludgeons and other weapons, being then and there unlawfully, maliciously and traitorously assembled and gathered together against our said Lord, the King, most wickedly, maliciously and traitorously did levy and make war against our said Lord the King, and being so assembled together, arrayed and armed against our said Lord the King, as aforesaid, did then and there with great force and violence, parade and march in an hostile manner through divers public streets and highways, aad did then and there maliciously and traitorously attempt and endeavour, by force and arms, to subvert end destroy the government and constitution of this realm, as by law established; and to deprive and depose our said Lord the King of and from the style, honour, and Kingly name of the Imperial Crown of fhis realm, in contempt of our said Lord the King and his laws, to the evil example of all others, contrary to the duty of the allegiance of them the said Arthur Thistlewood, James Watson the elder, James Watson the younger, Thomas Preston and John Hooper, against the form of the statue [*sic*] in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our said Lord the King, his Crown and dignity. "

At one o'clock the Attorney-General rose to address the Jury ; which he did in a speech that occupied two hours in the delivery. After havng stated the history of the transactions, he endeavoured to identify with them the prisoner James Watson; and concluded by asserting, that he possessed indubitable evidence of the criminality of the prisoner.

The first witness called was Thomas Storer, a printer in Fetter-lane, who had refused to print the petition, and a hand-bill inviting a meeting in Spa-fields.

Arthur Seal, another printer in Tottenham-court-road, proved his having printed 8OOO large and small bills for said meeting, copies of which were read. The evidence of two other witnesses was rejected.

John Monkhouse, of the Merlin's Cave, deposed that about 20,000 persons were present at and near his public-house and grounds among whom were Mr. Rainsford, the magistrate, and many peace-officers.

J. Fitzpatrick and V. G. Dowling both deposed to seeing Watson and Prestoa at the meeting; and the fawer-atatctt that frtshfh audit was a' glorious kiy. Mr. Dowling was giving a ininutt- history of the transactions, when Air. Serjeant Ccph-y and Mrs Weatherall took the most iißport-mt objection th j t will prttba'oly be made during the trial— that the speeches to which the evidence here applied, ought to have been set out in the indictment as overt acts of treason. The Court, however, over-ruled the objection, thinking they were set out with sufficient precision. [Here Lord Ellenhorough said, that the Court expected that no part of the proceedings should be made public, pending tne trial, on pain of contempt. ?? ' Mr. V. G. Howling was at this time under examination. When his examination was concluded, Mr. Howling addressed the Bench, and observed, that he had to solicit their Lordship's attention to himself. Their Lordships had just intimated their pleasure that no part of the proceedings should be ?? - till the trial was concluded. Unfortunately, being ignorant of their Lordship's determination, a Paper with which be was connected, had already published a full account of the proceedings up to a late hour, and unfortunately they, sinning in ignorance, had nhv-ndy sent if nit ftito fhe world. Lord Ellenborough - observed, what was already done could not be remedied ; those who had thus published the proceedings of the Court, whilst yet in an unfinished state, had done it at the peril of being punished for a???? contempt. Should any one, however, presume to publish any part of the proceedings, after this notice, till the whole was finished, the Court would not fail to visit the offender with iv severest animadversion??. At eight o'clock the Court adjourned till nine o'clock on Tuesday morning. Four Officers having been previously sworn in to uke charge ot the Jury, who are lodged at tbe King's Anns- Tavern. I'he prisoners were removed from the Court under the same escort with which they came down in the morning; a large crowd hail col. lected in the Hall to see thetn taken from the Court, and as they proceeded down the Hall to take coach at the great gate, they were loudly greeted by the populace. The trial of James Watson, sen. was resumed on Tuesday. Tiie following witnesses were examined for the Crown :— C. Shearman the younger, C. Slmtrman the elder, and Mr. J. Stafrcrd, Chief Clerk at Row-street l\*ice-Office, Air. Bwck- with, Mr. Piatt, Mr. Rae, Air. Rnu.don, Mr. Hall, Limbcrick, the Bow-street O&or^-Mr. Miikilet/.n, of Sldnher-slreet, Sir J.

THE RIOTS IN DERBYSHIRE, &c.

The following are the accounts that have reached us this morning. These disgraceful disturbances may, we think, be now considered as set at rest, at least for a time, the turbulent having been every where arrested in their career by the vigilance and activity of the Magistrates. We are concerned to state that two constables fell victims to the mad infatuation of the turbulent at Offerton, in Derbyshire :

FROM THE LICHFIELD MERCURY, FRIDAY, JUNE 13.

"We regret to have to record a Riot, attended with fatal consequences, at Offerton, about twelve miles from Derby. The intelligence reached this City early in the forenoon of Wednesday ; soon after which a detachment of infantry arrived in pursuit of two men who had made their escape; and who had been principal instruments in the affair by which two special constables had been killed. Two men, answering the description given, had passed through this City about two hours previously, taking the road to Walsall. One of the soldiers pushed on, and entered Walsall before the fugitives, who arrived by another route, they were both secured, and are now in custody.

" The above riot is said to be a part of a partial effort at insuriection, extending across the country into Yorkshire ; and, it is added, that some farther excsses may be immediately expected to take place. Several stands of arms were taken possession of by the mob, but the affair has terminated by the capture of about forty of them, who are lodged in Derby county gaol. The Derby Paper received yesterday is very *reserved* on this subject, but we believe that we are correct in stating that forty prisoners are in gaol, and that two special constables have fallen."

" LICHFIELD MERCURY OFFICE: THURSDAY NIGHT.

"We stop the press to state, that we have just received intelligence from Nottingham. The prisoners brought in there had *completely filled the gaol* ; yet all the principal roads were covered with detachments of prisoners still coming in. Great numbers had refused to act as special constables, and Nottingham was in a state of considerable ferment and apprehension from the multiplicity of conflicting reports. The report of a plan of a partial rising, extending from Nottingham across a most populous district, to the extremity of Yorkshire, seems to have been pretty correct ; and before twenty-four hours expire, many interesting particulars of the result will be made known. All the yeomanry corps are out, and many of have made forced marcnes by night , of twenty and thirty miles in extent. From the circumstance of a great number of the prisoners being armed, we fear that more blood has been shed."

FROM THE LEICESTER JOURNAL, JUNE 13.

"Monday last, it is now known beyond a doubt, was fixed for the execution of those revolutionary scenes, thee commencement of which was so lately averted at Manchetster by a happy discovery of the atrocious design, there prepared for the destruction of the country. The very day on which the trials of the persons now charged with High Treason are proceeding with in London was, it appears, to have been also distinguished by the beginning of a civil war all over the kingdom ! But the vigilance of Government and of the Magistracy is too unceasing and universal for the disturbers of public tranquility, to have any chance of success in their desperate and wicked courses.

"Tuesday afternoon the Mayor and Magistrates received an express, informning them that a Simultaneous rising of the disaffected had taken place, at midnight, at South Winfield. and several other villages in Derbyshire. It appears that the mobs were armed with fire-arms, pikes, and other weapons, and were proceeding in a body to Nottingham. Magistrates *here* instantly adopted measures suited to the occasion, and we are happy to say that no disposition to disturbance was manifested in this town or neighbourhood.

"Wednesday morning the Mayor received another dispatch from Nottingham, stating that the mob from the North Western side of Derbyshire had advanced near to Eastwood, on their way to Nottingham. A party of the 15th Hussars, under Captain Phillips and Mr. Loft, accompanied by Mr. Rolloaston and Mr. C. G. Mundy, as Magistrates, set out to meet them. They got sight of them about a mile this side of Eastwood : the moment the insurgents saw the troops, they fled in all directions across the fields, and although they were pursued with great speed, the military could secure no more than eight and twenty—many of whom had arms in their hands.

"A very considerable number of loaded guns, pikes, pitchforks, and a few swords, have been collected, which the mob had thrown away in their flight. The fire-arms were all loaded, for the most part, with ball, but not a shot was fired. The pikes are new, very strong, of a formidable appearance, and considerable length. Many of the prisoners had powder and ball about them, and many bullets were found on the road. They had searched all the houses on their way for arms and ammunition, and men, whom they compelled to go with them. They declared all the way, *that Plunder was not their object, but to obtain their Right, and alter the Government*.— They seem to have committed no outrage, except that it was stated that one man was killed by them in Derbyshire. The military drove them out of the county of Nottingham into Derbyshire, where a great many were taken by the High Sheriff, with a troop of yeomanry of that county. All was quiet is Nottingham when the dispatch came away. Two troops of yeomanry were in the town, and scouts out on the Derbyshire side. Nothing can exceed the zeal, alacrity, and good spirit of the 15th Hussars, and 96th Infantry.

"The Yeomanry Cavalry of this county have received orders to hold themselves in readiness to assemble at a moment's warning, and the Magistrates are every where on the alert. Part of the Leicester troops of Yeomanry marched on Tuesday evening to escort seven State Prisoners through the Town, in consegnence of an express from the Magistrates of Sheffield ; but it appears that at Mansfield the King's Messengers in whose custody they were travelling took the direction of the North Road, on account of the disturbances which had broken out."
