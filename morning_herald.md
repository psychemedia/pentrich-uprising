THE LATE RIOTS.

The advices of yesterday from Derbyshire and Nottinghanshire, we are happy to, find, are of a very pacific nature.

The following is from a Derby Paper of Thursday:

We have this week to announce to our readers the rising of a number of those deluded people who have for some time threatened the peace of the country under the influence of the Hampden Clubs. At the same time we have the satisfaction to state, that from the vigilance with which the conspiracy had been watched, and the promptness with which it has been met, there remains no cause for alarm or apprehension to the loyal and well affected. To say more at this moment might be improper. A number of prisoners have ben taken, and their cases are under investigation befors the Magistrates."— *Derby Mercury.*.

EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM DERBY, JUNE 11.

" The symptoms of which were manifested yesterday seem to be quelled. It appears that two troops of hussars from Nottingham had arrived early yesterday at Langley Mill, where they found an assemblage of about three hundred persons, some having fire arms, others pikes, &c. The hussars charged the mob, who immediately dispersed ; fifteen or sixteen of the ringleaders were taken and sent to Nottingham. Two troops of cavalry front Derby divided, one towards Ripley, and the other among the colliers near Hoanor. Between Ripley and Alfreton they found the Chesterfield troop actively employed, the dispersed  mob having made their appearance on their route, issuing threats, &c. Great numbers have been secured. Five or six were brought to Derby in the afternoon, and about nine o'clock last night twenty-nine more. Several were taken this morning, and every thing now appears quiet. The disturbance is supposed to have originated in the discharge of some men from Butterly Foundry, in consequence of belonging to some Jacobinical Club."

SPECIAL COMMISSION

Derby, October TREASON TRIALS

FIFTI -1 trrner was the person -selected by Officers of the Crown to be tried next. 1115' i was formerly in the Militia, but having volunteered • in the 20th heoitnent of Foot, he has since been abroad, and in b Egypt and elsewhere fought battles of his country. He is a tall man, 47 age. He was brought from the gaol in the same as had been pursued with Brandreth, to ,o l ' i wrist of Mr. Eaton, jun. at about a quarter bei eight. He did not shew the same degree of filvangs'of had been displayed by his predecessor at the did his countenance exhibit the same maiked teristics. He is a man of plain appearance: h‘euretl dressed very decently, in a blue coat and C waistcoat. , The Court having assembled at eight o'clock, 1,, the confusion resulting from the public, baying subsided, the prisoner was P" - ' the bar. The Lonc CnrEF then called on the Attorney General and the Counsel for the Crown to with chall.Anges.

PUBLICATION OF THE PROCEEDING ?????????

Mr. DENMAN immediately rose, and addidse Bench to the following effect My Lords—I feel it to be V dlltV to C all the °li (i cti s : (ion of the Court to what I corxcive to be 9 SC D BII O OI' lous contempt of the order pronounced by you,' do ships—calculated in my mind, to poison rii e . administration of justice, and a most harefacol to the authority of the Coot t. At the of the;e proceedings, it was by your Lord 'l'l' s ' distinctly stated, that no publication of aaY I' e these proceedings was to take place, until tb e • was completed ; and on the following day Y °llt ship repeated !t at prohibition, in still stronger Not what Was then said by a the partial and garbled account of the proceed in !' s been issued froni the public press : a nd calls , opinion, for the severest visitation of every C° t a ir i rp Justice, which does not mean to make itself a to its own degradation Awl the misfortune is) it is not a full statement, but a partial extr a ,ve part of the procuedings, namely, the ral's Speech ; which is reported in a " 13 1, that the prisoners who now temain or trial, eau'igb by any Possibility, fairly take their trial ; ina slil ato as it is impossible that the Jury who are to try 'for can come tmprejudiced into the box, after bled a statement. The paper I allude to, *Morning Chronicle* ; that Paper I in tuY It is the only Paper in my possession ; thourve am credibly info: med that all the London I ) 4fie r9 r ,/ in some degree infringed the order of the this paper reported the whole of proqe ( i l l tif I do not know, on the part of the prisoners, Learned Ft lend and myself have :from a partial statetnnt I think is to arise. The pi etence put forward tor t of the prohibition of the Court, Makes it disable. It is alledged by the publisher, that he he le s ! duced to make this publication in consequeocepe vague publication having been made by ld naiist. Now, nothing can be more easYdo n t° the order, and laugh at the authority of such such subterfuges w - e to be permitted. ing Chronicle complains that another pr fished an imperfect account of the Attorney General's speech ; and then it proceeds itself to mischievous account, for the sake of ccoectiri, which has been published :—and w bat hr s t / finitely more dangerous is, that the paper wi c h ' published, and induced the publication of Iv ei ' ' t - G° now complain, is under the known influen ce - ternment. Mr. Justice ABBOTT.—I don't know Court can_linow nothing of newspaper. know nothing of whether it is under that lil a - I .llr, under the influence of a private individual ' self, I can say truly, that I do not know r ) , a er bii.; o 9 has been stated, nor do I believe it.

Mr. DENMAN—I admit, my Lord, t wrong. The Court could not know any . ' l l' l ,lo l.- % did not appear before them upon atEdavit• I complain of is, that it is set forward on 011'.0111;(f the pretence for publishing, that these prose cljt i l brought forward for the purpose of ll and that Mr. Oliver is at the bottom of then l , ) ,,o l : t other argues that the Ministers are only tak di c 7 o oo l 4 , ' measures for repressing the disorders of th e ;to and bringing the disturbers of the public Peace n ce tice. ' nese arguments are made the Pre, a te ' r isiv i r f treating with contempt the order of your and of violating that most wholesome which the Court had adopted in the outset O f " t - h iS wess. I can only lay before your Lordshirs perfect account of the Attorney • which I do state is calcuLted to prejudice ti' e. bt lts 4 2 , the remaining prisoners, whatever effect 01 0 r. been produced by an impartial statement of ti le r j,bir of the proceedings, and I leave it with t 'relt to what you think t CI

The ATTORNEY GEN con cur toc' s ' , with my learned friend, Mr.Denmen, his complaint ; and I can only

The LORD CHIEF BARON—Do you follow any motion ?

Mr. DENMAN—All I can say is, that havi'l,-,tsliculb this complaint, I leave it to the Court to further proceeding as they think necessary 10 t ll.- its own authority. I thought it duty to or e complaint before your Lordships the very first tunity that 'presented itself. , 

The CHIEF BARON.—If there is n o ni I don't se e how the Court is to act. 0 1 Mr. DENMAN—Your Lordship will or the conduct of those who have infringed the the Court.

The LORD CHIEF BARON Who ( " se have done so ?

Mr. DENMAN—I thought it my matter before the Court, 

The ATTORNEY ( -- i - 6:ErtAL—I feel it to be It) address a few words to y o ur afte,refere, has been stated by my Learned Friend 1 ) 14 1)1 0 0 0 1 . ; : do so, I beg to intimate to your Lordship, 01 : to follow my Learned Friend's the jus , e 4 0 15 no motion. What has been stated by Friend, renders it incumbent on ' ffl e, I thin k ' 5,4 7 in the situation in which I do) to say a h o itt to your Lordship upon this subject. Until vo i 'last ten minutes, I had not seen any account o t has hitherto passed before this' Court, or P e/ ports to be an account of these proceedings.

so happens that the Paper which my Learned Friend has alluded to, as calling for some expression of the displeasure of the Court, was put into my hand just before I came into Court, for the purpose of being brought under my notice. About ten minutes ago  some person (I don't know who that person was) sent me one of the Newspapers which my Learned Friend alluded to—not the *Morning Chronicle*, but the *Courier*. That Paper I have seen, and I do lament, as much as my Learned Friend can possibly do, that any person should in any degree have violated the orders which your Lordship had promulgated on the first and secon d days of these proceedings ; because it may tend to injure, though not prevent, the due admistration of justice, by influencing, in some degree, the minds of the Jury. But I must beg leave to say, for myself, and for my Honourable and Learned Friends of Counsel for the Crown, (and I am quite sure I can say, — indeed I can undertake to say the same thing for every person who has any thing in the shape of an office under the Government) that we had no wish nor could we in any degree have wished that any thing should be stated to the public, of what passed here, until the whole can be stated fairly and properly.

TO DO  11 4, uer e one phrase which my Learned Friend has e s e,d , which I could have wished had not escaped him, at which I confess I was much surprised, because c c annot hut tend to prejudice the proceedings of the ourt. My _Friend has talked of " Newsti • T rs under the influence of Government." For myn-u,; I only say, I k now o f no ne wsp a pers under the ernttience of G overnment— b y whom employed or not vo Y' n Yed. I knaw nothing of them, or of those by m they are conducted. I know nothing of publication s b u t as t h e sent i men t s o f public peblic affairs. I know nothing of the i d Per alluded to by my Learned Friend, or of the i: re nns by whom it is conducted. MI I can say p u ' L , t .hat whoever may the persons who conduct homC newspipers on the one side or the other, who violated the injunction of the Court, it t nr 7 ,,alle brought, by proper affidavits, before your (Ishii) h L ,• dis.nictay proving them to have infii i nged ordshsip'S order, I shall feel it to be my tatty, eth l nnt favour or partiality to the one side or the submit such a motion as will put the anthoea.! o f the Court in force ; or if t oy Learned Friend Point out those who have violated the order of the i ! h a l ") I shall cheerfully ass i st hi m no w i n bringin g. LoParties am power of your Lordships. I' nnt mys e lf seen the paper wh i ch my L earne d 41 ; 11 4 has particulaily named. I really know not of hut knowledge that the order has been infringed, re ta i iii et ng my Learned Friend's statement to be cortubc.l most concur with hi m in thinking, that the ' a tion was extremely improper. If the order le„ h ; e en violated, strongly protest against it, as 'Y improper and incorrect. My Learned Friend t"ests, one of the papers urges, as tat excuse for • tPitithlication, that something like a professed account. ae ott e i Proceedings bad been previously , published ii °nue t e L Pilter. I not seen that professed acke4C I can oniy say, that we have had no coinand s c h atk la with the party making the publication,, %ha p , at we are perfectly innocent of any thing in the to of Publication ; and, in fact, can have no dee Publi sh any part of these proceedings. No b, - and no man can more strongly the conduct complained of ; because the le extremely imeroper: even if it is core 4 etlin - " it ed• It is very improper to publish the pro-14Ils!s fr om time to time; because an impression _ One way or the other; and such conduct • ' . y opinion, to obstruct the administration f u l iv * I have nothing more to say. I admit Tith my Learned Friend, the impropriety e l t l tto t i t ,Tnnct complained of; and I reprobate it as my friend can possibly do. I am e r i rsee b otly it has beeet done, yet I am Cer t ° belie ve th a t the infringement of tile from a 'desire to do that which is wring iyZkr t Ili p - uta to the eslitors. of papers a tive of ' have no doubt it arose, from a desire to N l 7'; t i ,', 4 e sale of the newspapers which they conansea 1 do hope that, Gentlemen are taking trials f or pu bli cat i on , t h e y will have the I„ e , t tial s keep .hack those notes till the whole of lalfinished. If, after this intimation, my t'tlid will produce affidavits of any persons Y to infrin ge d the order, I shall feel it my 10 10 - 1 4 ng the conduct of such party under the noe t'ti•et4l. 

MR. DENMAN in reply—I fully acquit my Learned Friend, the Attorney General, and my other Learned Friend, of any intention, or any suspicion of having published, or having lent themselves to the publication of any part of the proceedings. All I can say is, that it will hardly be sufficient merely to promulgate an order ; and I hope the Court will vindicate its privileges.

THE LORD CHIEF BARON— It is a very unfortunate and a very mischievous thing—mischievous in every mischievous to all sides. But a ll "w ot it is, dint a newspaper is produced fli nn ot account complained of.

At present there is no motion, or affidavit produced which can be the foundation of any motion. Therefore, pursuing the course adopted in the recent case, to which I have alluded, I think we ought to pass on to this.

THE KING V. WILLIAM TURNER.

Mr. Lowndes now proceeded in the usual form to intimate to the prisoner at the bar his right to challenge the Jury as they came to the book to be sworn; after which he called over the names of the Jurymen in the older in which they had been summoned. Two of the former Jury, who offered to serve again, were challenged for the prisoner, on whose behalf the following thirty-three were challenged.

Wm. White, of Inderidgehay, farmer.  
Robt. Beard, Dalbury, ditto  
Wm. Salt, ditto ditto  
John Heacock, Etwall, Esq.  
Wm. Bailey, ditto, farmer  
Thos. Archer, Hatton, ditto  
Thos. Orame, ditto, ditto  
Sam. Archer, Hallington, do.  
Thos. Hall, ditto, ditto  
Walthal Spurrier, ditto, ditto  
Robt. Wagstaff, ditto  
Wm. Bakewell, Sudbury, do.  
Thos. Hollis, ditto, ditto  
Luke Turner, ditto, ditto  
Henry Hall, Sutton, ditto  
Thus. Stratton, Tinsaley, do.  
Wm. Walker, ditto, ditto  
Rich. Spencer, Ashleyhay, do.  
Thos. Cooper, Atlow, ditto

R. Pickering, Markeaton, do.  
T. Lowndes, Marston Montgomery, farmer  
John Bradshaw, Osbiston and Thiervaston, ditto  
Robert Shipton,_Scropton, do.  
John Stretton, ditto, ditto  
Robert Steeple, ditto  
John Skevington, Yeaveley  
W. Berresford, Snelston, gent.  
Solomon Frost, ditto, farmer

The following Jury (of whom some were challenged for Brandreth) was at lengthe swon—

Thos. Ensor, Marston on Dove, farmer
Henry Spurrier, ditto, ditto.  
M. Goodall, Marston Montgomery, farmer  
Thomas Hall, Sutton, ditto.  
Sam. Dean, Ashleyhay, ditto.

J. Wagstaff, Atlave, ditto  
Jos. Wheeldon, Alvaston, do.  
James Osborne, ditto, ditto.  
T. Crumpton, Darley Abbey, gt.  
J, Glover, Findern, farmer.  
J[?]. Haslam, Lit. Chester, ditto.  
T. Ordish, Mickleover, ditto.

As in the former case, the indictment was read over to the Jury by the CLerk of Assize, as containing the charges upon which the prisoner was to take his trial.

Mr. BALGUAY, as Junior Counsel, then opened the case—After which the SOLICITOR GENERAL addressed the Jury, taking the same course adopted by the Attorney General in the former Trial. The Learned Gentleman spoke for one hour and a quarter.

Witnesses were then called, and examined by the Counsel for the Crown, in their turn, commencing with Mr. Sergeant Vaughan.

The witnesses called were— Anthony Martin, Shirley Asherry, Thomas Turner, Henry Tomlinson, Elijah Hall, sen. Elijah Hall, jun. Isaac Walker, Mary Epworth, Joseph Wilkinson, Samuel Fletcher, William Shipman, Henry Hole, Wm. Booth, and Wm. Storer.

After the examination of some other witnesses, the Court adjourned till eight o'clock to-morrow morning.

Many of the prisoners are of respectable connexions, and some ot them have relations even in this town. It is a ,melancholy circumstance to relate, that the sister of one of them, named Hunt, a respectable milliner and dress-maker residing in Queen-street here, expired, last week, of a broken heart, occasioned by the horror which occupied her mind ever since she first learned that her unfortunate brother was one of the persons indicted for High Treason. This young man is of a respectable family, and spent a very considerable part of his life here previous to his apprehension. His unhappy sister was interred, on Saturday last, and her untimely and melancholy death is universally lamented.

BRANDRETH.

Brandreth was yesterday afternoon visited by the Chaplain of the gaol, to whose religious admonitions he was extremely attentive. His conduct since his conviction, as well indeed as before, has been decorous and correct. This morning, on the prisoners being brought down from their cells, several of them, among whom were Brandreth and the Ludlams, proceeded to perform their Religious duties, and remained in devout prayer for some time. These men, as well as the rest of their associates, have behaved, ever since their confinement with the utmost propriety; Brandreth has a wife and three children, and from a letter which he has written to his wife, it appears that she is now pregnant of a fourth. We have subjoined a copy of the letter in question, to the publication of,which the prisoner has said that he has no objection. All his desires now seem to be centered in the happiness and future prosperity of his family, for whose sake he has expressed a wish to raise a little sum of money. Persons who view, with proper sentiments, the crime of which the prisoner has been found guilty—but who, at the same time, regard the sentence which he is about to endure with the feelings of humanity, have contributed in a small degree to his desires, for which the wretched man has expressed himself most grateful.

The following is a literal copy of his letter, which as it shews the spirit of humility by which he is at present actuated, and can produce no mischief, but may have a different effect yupon the minds of those who, like him, may have departed from the paths of Religion, we have no hesitation in giving it to our readers.

Derby Gaol, Oct. 18, 1817.  
My dearly beloved Wife,—At last I thought it my duty to write a few lines to you, which I am sure will affect you very much, to inform you of my dreadful situation ; but I hope GOD be your friend—and if you will by Prayer appeal to God, you will undoubtedly find great consolation and relief for your distress, and as a husband and father let me entreat you that you will act a motherly part to the poor fatherless children, and bring them up in the fear of God, which is my most sincere desire, and likewise conduct yourself in an undeniable manner, as an example to the children to the love and fear of God, in the faith of JESUS CHRIST that you may never depart from that faith in Christ ; and I wish for the convincing of all the souls in the house, that they may be at the arrival of this, and that we may all meet in Heaven, where trouble ceases and all is joy and glory ! And I pray to GOD may this fatal stroke be joy to all that belong to me, instead of sorrow. Oh ! that I may be the cause of their holy salvation —may it penetrate each wounded heart, so as to be their sole conversion to God. My dear, you may suppose my feelings are not easily to be described. At this time the Sentence is not passed, but I am found guilty by the Jury this day. My dear wife, it would give me great consolation if I could see you before I depart from this life ; but my dear, if you are pregnant, I would have you advise with your poor distressed mother in law, whether it would be proper or not, and if she thinks it would not be of serious consequence, I should be very glad, but let it be well considered before you come to me, and if you do not come, let your father (if he thinks it would not be more than he can bear) as I know he is of a very timorous turn ; but if he, neither, comes, I shall write again, it God permit me. —So my beloved wife, I hope you will excuse my short letter at this time. You may inform all friends that Goo gave me great fortitude to bear up my spirits on trial.—So I hope the bellings of God will be with you all, and most especially with you and our poor little babes.—So I conclude  
Your most affectionate Husband,  
JEREMIAH BRANDRETH.
For Ann Brandreth, Geo. Bridget's, Bedlam-court, Sntton, in Ashfield.
